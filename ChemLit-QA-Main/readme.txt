This directory contains 3 contain Question-Answer-Context (QAC) type dataset for RAG and finetuning tasks for Chemistry.

1. chemlit_qa_full_dataset_1054_entries.csv: This is the main dataset. This dataset contain 1054 entries evaluated by experts.

2. chemlit_qa_train_split_843_entries.csv: This is a split from the main dataset for trainig tasks done in our original paper. We used this split for finetuning LLMs.

3. chemlit_qa_test_split_211_entries.csv: This is a smaller split from the main dataset for testing tasks carried out in our original paper. We used this split for comparing RAG models and testing finetuned LLMs.
