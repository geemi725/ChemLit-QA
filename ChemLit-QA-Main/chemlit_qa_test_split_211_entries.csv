309,"High Throughput Determination of Stern Volmer Quenching Constants for Common Photocatalysts and Quenchers Mechanistic information on reactions proceeding via photoredox catalysis has enabled rational optimizations of existing reactions and revealed new synthetic pathways. One essential step in any photoredox reaction is catalyst quenching via photoinduced electron transfer or energy transfer with either a substrate, additive, or co-catalyst. Identification of the correct quencher using Stern-Volmer studies is a necessary step mechanistic understanding; however, such studies are often cumbersome, low throughput and require specialized luminescence instruments. This report describes a high throughput method to rapidly acquire series of Stern-Volmer constants, employing readily available fluorescence plate readers and 96 well-plates. By leveraging multi-channel pipettors or liquid dispensing robots in combination with fast plate readers, the sampling frequency for quenching studies can be improved by several orders of magnitude. This new high-throughput method enabled the rapid collection of 220 quenching constants for a library of 20 common photocatalysts with 11 common quenchers. The extensive Stern-Volmer constants table generated greatly facilitates the systematic comparison between quenchers and can provide guidance to the synthetic community interested in designing and understanding catalytic photoredox reactions.",Explanatory,How many quenching constants did the new high-throughput method enable the rapid collection of?,220 quenching constants,Medium,['This new high-throughput method enabled the rapid collection of 220 quenching constants for a library of 20 common photocatalysts with 11 common quenchers.'],"[[1042, 1197]]","['quenching with all the quenchers tested (Figure ), which explains their increased use as versatile photocatalysts. On the contrary, photocatalysts such as Ru(phen)3Cl2 and Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2, one of the most important photocatalyst that launched the entire field of photoredox catalysis, exhibits fairly poor quenching with most substrates, which explains its decline in usage against more reactive Ir photocatalysts.In conclusion, we demonstrated the use of a highthroughput workflow for the measurements of Stern-Volmer quenching constants using commercially available fluorescence plate readers and 96-well plates. We validated the method by comparing the results to reported quenching values. Automatization of the liquid dispensing step allowed for the rapid preparation and analysis of the Stern-Volmer quenching for a collection of common photocatalysts and quenchers. We believe this workflow enables a consistent and rapid collection of quenching constants with readily available instrumentation, thereby finally bringing Stern-Volmer studies to the same level of high throughput capabilities as those for reaction discovery for photoredox catalysis. We believe this method, as well as the data generated is truly enabling for the community interested in mechanistic understanding of photoredox reactions.Experimental section: Chemicals and Materials: Unless stated otherwise, all the reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers (Acros, Merck Millipore Sigma, TCI America, Fisher Scientific, etc) and were of the highest analytical purity. UPLC grade solvents were used for all experiments. All operations we performed inside of a N2-filled glovebox. For the high throughput experiments, 96-well uv-star® microplates (part number 655809) were used. For the validation experiments, the microplate used was a 96-well quartz microplate (part', 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b14"">[14] ; this can include questions such as establishing which reaction component is acting as the main quencher and the magnitude of quenching that occurs under catalytically relevant conditions. In some cases, quenching studies have resulted in revisions of the originally proposed mechanisms, while mechanistic understanding has led to designing improved photoefficiencies, faster reactions, and expanded scope. Emission quenching (also called Stern-Volmer) studies consist of measuring emission intensity fluctuations of the photocatalyst excited state in the presence of a quencher. In a typical Stern-Volmer study, a fluorometer is used to measure the emission intensity, and solutions of the photocatalyst with different concentrations of quenchers need to be prepared individually under a rigorously inert atmosphere to avoid the interference of oxygen quenching. Such constraints have limited the prevalence of Stern-Volmer studies compared to the extensive body of work on photoredox catalysis. A fully automated continuous flow platform has been developed to facilitate data collection and reduce manual labor, but remains low throughput and requires the construction of a homemade flow setup. In parallel, several high-throughput technologies such as LED-illuminated 96well plates as well as microfluidic and screening capabilities have been developed to allow for parallelized rapid discovery of new photoredox reactions. <ref', ""measured separately to extract I and build the Stern Volmer plot. We decided to take advantage of the parallelization offered by 96-well plates to propose a Stern-Volmer plate design which involves increasing quencher concentration moving down a column, with a different quencher (or replicate) in each column (Figure ). Multichannel pipettors enabled the rapid dispensing of each component across the entire plate. To maintain a strict inert atmosphere around the samples, the entire sample preparation and measurement was performed under inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen filled glovebox in constant purge mode. This was made possible by the small footprint of the fluorescence plate reader, which can easily be introduced into a glovebox. To validate this design, we sought to test our approach by comparing Ksv values obtained with our workflow to values reported in the literature. We probed the quenching of (2,2'-Bipyridine)bis[2pyridinyl-\uf06bN)phenyl-\uf06bC]iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) by diethylbromomalonate, bromoacetonitrile and indole in dichloroethane (DCE) and observed similar trends in the quenching values, with diethylbromomalonate exhibiting a higher Ksv than bromoacetonitrile by a factor of 1.7 (in the original report, the factor is 2) and indole showing virtually no quenching (Figure ).  However, we measured higher quenching constants overall by a factor of ~2. This difference is likely because of our ability to consistently maintain the sample in an inert atmosphere throughout the entire measurement using this workflow.With this positive validation result in hand, we sought to showcase the magnitude of quenching data accessible through this high-throughput method. We decided to focus on generating Stern Volmer constants for a library of commonly used photocatalysts and quenchers in a rapid fashion. We automated the plate preparation by"", 'Results and DiscussionIn photoredox reactions, the first step in the photochemical cycle is excitation of the photocatalyst by a photon of the appropriate wavelength. Upon excitation, the photocatalyst can decay back to the ground state in a radiative (via photon emission, i.e. fluorescence or phosphorescence) or non-radiative way (heat) (Figure ). In the presence of increased concentration of a quencher, the photocatalyst excited state can also react via EnT or PET, which will compete with radiative decays and ultimately decrease photon emission (Figure ). The decrease in emission intensity is linked to the concentration of quencher as described by the Stern-Volmer equation (equation 1):𝐼 0 𝐼 = 1 + 𝑘 𝑞 𝜏 0 [𝑄] (1)where I0 is the emission intensity in the absence of quencher, I is the intensity in the presence of quencher, kq is the quenching constant, \uf0740 is the excited state lifetime and [Q] is the quencher concentration. The product of kq and \uf0740 is often described as Ksv, the Stern-Volmer constant. KSV can be used to compare quenching rates between different quenchers (Figure ). The knowledge of Ksv and [Q] for all the components of a reaction enables the ranking of quenching power and ultimately identification of the main quencher for the photocatalyst.In a typical Stern Volmer experiment, independent solutions of different concentrations of quenchers and a constant concentration of photocatalyst need to be prepared under a rigorously inert atmosphere, and the excitation intensity of each one must be measured separately to extract I and build the Stern Volmer plot. We decided to take advantage of', 'rapid discovery of new photoredox reactions. To keep up with the exponentially increasing chemical space for photoredox transformations, new workflows that enable Stern-Volmer data collection at a higher throughput need to be developed.To that end, we have devised a protocol for the collection of Stern-Volmer quenching data using commercially available fluorescence plate readers and consumable 96-well plates. Plate readers are ubiquitous in biological studies and have been used in a variety of colorimetric and fluorometric assays, as they allow for rapid (<1 min) reading of an entire 96-well plate. In our quenching studies, the use of well-plates enables the collection of Stern-Volmer constants for one photocatalyst and up to 12 quenchers in less than a minute. We further expanded the throughput of this workflow by devising a protocol for a liquid handling robot to enable the automated dispensing of quenchers at increasing concentrations in a 96-well plate format. This allowed us to rapidly prepare multiple plates of 20 commonly used photocatalysts, and for each, measure the Stern-Volmer constants of 11 common quenchers. The 220 quenching rates table generated opens the door for deeper data analysis of quenching trends and mechanisms, and we believe will be useful to the community interested in mechanistic understanding of photoredox catalysis.']","['Spectroscopy', 'Optical spectroscopy']",235,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9984093607755968,1.1102230246251563e-16,['how']
1363,"This workA) B) No significant amount of side-products was observed by HPLC analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of reaction has never been described before and represents a new type of crossover system. The literature describes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis/alcoholysis of sulfinamides, and recently, two groups have reported transulfinamidation of primary sulfinamides with an excess of (hydroxyl)amines under metal catalysis. These are the closest examples of similar sulfinamide reactivity. Encouraged by the initial results, we set off to determine the scope of this reaction. First, the N-substituents were varied. Various tertiary sulfinamides with cyclic and acyclic aliphatic N-substituents underwent the crossover reaction with high yields, resulting in an almost equimolar mixture of products as determined by HPLC (Fig. ). Sulfinamides 1f and 2fbearing basic tertiary amino group can also serve as substrates for the crossover when 0.4 equivs of TFA catalyst is utilized. Secondary sulfinamides are also suitable substrates, as exemplified by Fig. entry 6.

Leveraging mild acid catalysis, the reaction demonstrates high tolerance to structural variations, yielding equimolar products across diverse sulfinamide substrates. Notably, small sulfinamide libraries can be selectively oxidized to sulfonamides, providing a new platform for ligand optimization and discovery in medicinal chemistry. This crossover chemotype provides a new tool for high-throughput experimentation in discovery chemistry.A crossover reaction is typically associated with biological systems where two DNA molecules can swap pieces of their sequences (Fig. ). This enzyme-catalyzed biological crossover is an essential part of sexual reproduction and one of the major drivers of the evolution of sexual organisms. In chemistry, certain functional group's reactions follow the same path of crossing over their substituents (Fig. ).For instance, alkene cross-metathesis or disulfide exchange are examples of such reactions that enable swapping substituents under metal and thiol catalysis, respectively. Several such reactions in chemistry have been heavily utilized in the field of dynamic combinatorial libraries (Fig. ). <ref"", 'of these experiments indicates that regardless of the starting substrates, the reactions lead to an equilibrium of almost equimolar amounts of products. This indicates that the thermodynamic stability of the given sulfinamides is similar, and the steric/electronic effects do not play a major role, at least for the substrates tested. It should be noted that the reaction also proceeds in other solvents than DMSO, such as toluene or acetonitrile. However, DMSO turned out to be the most general solvent in terms of the solubility of both substrates and products. Oftentimes, substrates were well soluble in each solvent, however, the resulting mixture of products after the crossover led to the crystallization of products that complicated further analysis. In terms of limitations, primary sulfinamides undergo the crossover reaction, however with a significant amount of side-products. Also, sulfinamides with electron-rich aromatic N-substituents led to unwanted side-products of the same mass, as indicated by HPLC-MS analysis. These observations are consistent with the reports on acid-catalyzed rearrangement of N-aromatic sulfinamides to sulfoxides. Also, we tested the crossover reaction conditions between sulfinamide and sulfonamide. As expected, no significant reaction was observed after a prolonged reaction time.

All nine products were synthesized, and the crossover reaction was performed with six sets of three different sulfinamides. All', 'and the crossover reaction was performed with six sets of three different sulfinamides. All six reactions led to the formation of nine expected products with a very similar ratio of products and close to equimolar representation (Fig. ). HPLC traces of the crossover reactions indicated that regardless of the initial combination of substrates, a good yield of all the combinatorial products with only a minimal amount of side-products is achieved. These experiments corroborated that the sulfinamide crossover is suitable for generation a new type of dynamic combinatorial libraries. It should be pointed out that sulfinamides are generally stable compounds in neutral and basic aqueous environment. Therefore, the resulting libraries are compatible with biochemical binding assays. The limited stability in acidic aqueous buffers and possible biological oxidation can be a limiting factor in more complex biological experiments. We hypothesized that freezing the libraries by oxidation to sulfonamides would provide stable compounds of relevance in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, we subjected the mini-library of nine sulfinamides to mild oxidation with mCPBA.Delightfully, the oxidation proceeded smoothly, providing an expected set of nine sulfonamides with minimum side-products (see SI). Also, we confirmed the expected boost in stability of sulfonamides compared to sulfinamides under acidic aqueous conditions (see SI).The crossover reaction described offers a new principle that has transformative potential in the field of discovery chemistry. The simplicity and generality of the new crossover reaction make it suitable for applications spanning fields from supramolecular to medicinal chemistry.

We hypothesized that the nucleophilic nature of the nitrogen, along with the electrophilic character of the S=O bond, could lead to the crossover reaction of two different sulfinamides under specific conditions.

Since control experiments (in absence of Au nanoparticeles) already establish that reaction is mainly driven by the presence of Au nanoparticles, we interpret the temperature corresponding to the value of K eq at a given light intensity to be a measure of energy available to the reactants at the active site. We denote this quantity as an effective temperature (T eff ) of the reaction site.A closer look at these curves (figure ) shows that as laser intensity is increased, resulting value of K eq and hence T eff obtained increases systematically (see table ). Progress of initial part of the reaction, analogous to thermally-driven case, is depicted in figure . Quite clearly, as laser intensity (and hence T eff ) increases, rate of formation of HD and corresponding rate constants increase. Using rate constants obtained at different T eff , we estimate the activation energy in this case to be 0.21 ± 0.02 eV (figure ). Most significant point emerging from these observations is that, activation energy obtained in the case of', 'Progress of the reaction observed with pulsed vs c/w laser illumination is shown in figure . These results show quite clearly that initial rates observed for c/w and pulsed laser experiments, carried out under similar experimental conditions are very close to each other. Although comparison is limited to relatively lower intensities that are available from our c/w laser, the close correspondence among the observed rates suggests that this trend should also hold true at higher intensities too. Based on these observations, we believe that any major differences resulting from the pulsed vs c/w nature of light used in our experiments can be ruled out.Consequently, any underestimation of T eff in case of pulsed laser based experiments can also be ruled out.Above presented results clearly show that activation energy for light-induced reaction is much lower than the thermally-driven case. We interpret this large difference in activation energies as a signature of different reaction pathways followed under thermally driven and light induced conditions. These observations are also qualitatively consistent with the earlier proposed hypothesis based on first principles calculations, where it was suggested that plasmonic excitation causes transient electron transfer to the adsorbate molecules leading to bond weakening, thereby lowering the activation barrier and leading to enhanced reaction rates compared to the thermal reaction pathway. Dashed lines depict linear fit to the data points obtained with pulsed laser, and have been included to indicate the trend.

Random uncertainties in our measurements arise mainly from the variations observed in partial pressure measurements. E a = 0.21 ± 0.02 eV Having said that, we observe that its contribution is rather small and of the order of one to two percent. Systematic errors in our measurements majorly arise from uncertainties in the determination of gas sensitivity factors, based on which the concentrations (partial pressures) of H 2 , D 2 and HD are obtained. These will lead to an uncertainty in K eq and hence the estimation of temperatures. However, even a conservative estimate of ±5% uncertainty in the calibration factors does not make much difference to the calculated activation energies.Most importantly, qualitative nature of these results remain same i.e., activation energy in case of light-induced reaction is much lower than its thermal counterpart.Another point that needs to be considered is that the pulsed laser used in our measurements can possibly cause a much larger temperature jump due to transient heating, leading to an underestimation of T eff and hence the activation energy.

Since the phosphorylation levels of MOM proteins are regulated by the balance between phosphorylation by PINK1 and dephosphorylation by DUBs (step (i) in Fig. ) , the observed acceleration of Parkin recruitment in Fig. is likely due to the increased phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Parkin by artificially recruiting cytPINK1 on the MOM. In other words, our photochromic CID technique can manipulate the phosphorylation levels of proteins on the MOM in a photoreversible manner and may eventually be applied to the regulation of other signaling pathways.We also recognize some drawbacks of this photochromic CID system.

However, even though the PhyB/PIF system allows excellent spatiotemporal control, it also faces other problems, such as the large size of the protein modules (99 and 11 kDa) and the bimodal absorption spectra overlapping with the excitation/emission of various fluorescent proteins , which limit their widespread use in the control of biomolecules.Another tool for regulating cellular processes is chemically induced dimerization (CID) systems furnished by chemical dimerizers, which involve two ligand moieties to induce dimerization or association of target proteins . CID systems are suitable for investigating long-term cellular events such as mitosis by sustaining protein dimers. Recently, photoactivatable or photocleavable CID systems, termed caged CID, have been reported and have attracted attention as new chemical tools for regulating intracellular protein dynamics. Caged CID systems provide a higher spatiotemporal precision than conventional CID systems. We also developed a caged covalent-CID system that maintains stable protein dimers applicable to gel electrophoresis . These caged CID systems revealed complex cellular systems, such as the specialized properties of a kinesin motor and the molecular', 'Halo-mOrange2-CAAX were treated with pcDH, and time-lapse fluorescence images were acquired (Fig. ). The PCC value, which indicates the localization of eDHFR-miRFP670nano-NES to the plasma membrane, was the highest under violet light illumination and gradually decreased as the intensity of mixed green light increased, approaching the value when only green light was applied (Fig. ). This indicates that the E/Z isomer ratio of pcDH can be quantitatively adjusted by controlling the ratio of light intensity at the two wavelengths, resulting in fine recruitment of intracellular proteins in a photoreversible manner. This is one of the advantages of this system, which is based on fast photoreversible switching.Optical manipulation of subcellular signal transduction to induce mitophagy. Finally, we applied the photochromic CID system for the optical manipulation of biomolecular networks in live cells. The autophagy-mediated degradation of mitochondria, termed mitophagy, is an essential intracellular event for maintaining cellular homeostasis, in which damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria are degraded in lysosomes . The PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated pathway plays a crucial role in the removal of damaged mitochondria among several mechanisms. PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of damaged mitochondria, is autophosphorylated, and phosphorylates ubiquitin, followed by recruitment and activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to induce mitophagy . While the conventional CID system allows PINK1 to be recruited to the MOM, followed by mitophagy induction , it is challenging to spatiotemporally regulate PINK1 recruitment to']","['Biomedical engineering and technology', 'Regenerative medicine']",365,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9459114283513814,1.8359074247623468,['why']

The impinging single sheets and resulting mixed sheet were illuminated by a 365 nm UV light panel with dimensions of 8 cm x 12 cm. Since the UV source power was not constant over the entire mixed sheet, equation 21 was not used for calculating the fluorescence at any point in the mixed sheet. Only general predictions from the equation such as a proportionality between 𝐹𝐼 and the path length (at a specific point in the mixed sheet) were used for analysis of the results.Instead, the relative nature of fluorescence indicated that the fluorescence intensity of a mixed sheet produced from the impingement of acid and base could be compared to the fluorescence intensity of the impingement of buffers or constant pH reference solutions. The relationship between fluorescence intensity and hydroxide ion (or hydrogen ion) concentration was determined by self-impinging identical reference solutions of known pH (i.e impinging single sheets of the same solution at one another). Unlike the acid-base impingement, there were no concentration profiles in the mixed sheet for the impinged reference solutions, and thus, the measured fluorescence intensity at any point in the mixed sheet applied to the pH of the reference solution. For each experimental run, buffer solutions of pH 4 or 6, 7, 8, and 10 were typically self-impinged along with self-impingement of the acid reactant (pH < 3) and selfimpingement of the base reactant (pH > 11). The constant pH solutions covered the entire range of pH variations within the acid-base mixed sheet.Initial concentrations of",Causal,Why was equation 21 not used for calculating the fluorescence at any point in the mixed sheet?,"Equation 21 was not used for calculating the fluorescence at any point in the mixed sheet because the UV source power was not constant over the entire mixed sheet.

These concentrations must be related to fluorescence intensity.A series of photographs from a typical experiment are shown in Figure . ImageJ software was used to analyze the fluorescence profiles of the photographs . The photographs were imported into ImageJ as a stack, which creates a stack of equally sized images that are superimposed one on top of the other. A radial line from the origin of the single sheets to just beyond the end of the mixed sheet is drawn on one of the images in the stack. ImageJ will then place the radial line at the exact same location on the other images in the stack. After the radial line is drawn, a profile of the gray scale values (a proxy for the fluorescence intensity) for each pixel along the radial line is created for each image in the stack.The profiles of fluorescence intensity with time for the radial lines of all solutions were exported to a spreadsheet for further analysis. The measured fluorescence intensities, however, need to be adjusted to subtract the background fluorescence . The background fluorescence (expressed as a gray scale pixel intensity) was subtracted from the ImageJ measured gray scale intensities using method 1 listed in reference . For the reference solutions, the pH was constant, so the profiles illustrate how the fluorescence intensity for a mixed sheet at constant pH varies with UV power and distance from the impingement zone. For the acid-base impingement, the fluorescence profiles were additionally"", 'the impingement zone. For the acid-base impingement, the fluorescence profiles were additionally affected by the pH, which varied along a radial line indicating the progress of the neutralization reaction.The background-adjusted, fluorescence intensity profiles for all photographs of the impinging solutions in the stack shown in Figure is illustrated in Figure . Since the velocity in the mixed sheet was constant, the time traveled by the liquid along the radial line shown in Figure , as measured from the impingement zone, was simply equal to the pixel distance from the impingement zone (𝑟) divided by the mixed sheet velocity (𝑣 𝑚 ).Figure illustrates that the collision of the liquids causes the fluorescence intensity to rapidly increase and peak in the impingement zone, especially for the acid-base mixture and for the neutral and basic mixtures (pH 7, pH 8, and pH 10). Once the liquid leaves the impingement zone, there is a rapid decay in fluorescence intensity. However, the figure shows that the slope of the decay for the acid-base impingement is steeper than the slope of decay for the constant pH solutions. In Figure , for example, after 1.8 ms, the acid-base mixed sheet fluoresced as if the average pH were 7. At about 10 ms, the acid-base mixture fluoresced as if the average pH were equal to 6.0. At any pixel along the radial line shown in Figure , fluorescence intensities (𝐹𝐼) for the constant pH solutions allow for a 𝐹𝐼 versus [𝑂𝐻 -] chart to be plotted. Figure plots 𝐹𝐼 versus [𝑂𝐻 -] at 𝑟 = 500 on Figure for the constant pH solutions only. As expected, this plot is typical of an acid-base titration', 'each slice also changed.Since the fluorescence intensity is a function of path length at a specific pixel, 𝐹𝐼 for a slice, j, of the slab can be calculated as:𝐹𝐼 𝑗,𝑟 = (𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 ) 𝛥𝑦 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟(24)where 𝛥𝑦 is the thickness of each slice and 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 is the thickness of the mixed sheet at 𝑟 (liquid sheets thin as they expand). For the simulation of acid reacting with base, it is assumed that the 𝑂𝐻 -concentration within the slice is constant; the thinner the slice, the more accurate this assumption is. However, no improvement in simulation results was seen when the number of slices was increased from 100 to 150 per half slab. 𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 is the fluorescence, at a distance of 𝑟 pixels from the impingement zone, of a constant [𝑂𝐻 -] mixed sheet, which has the same [𝑂𝐻 -] as the jth slice. 𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 is determined from the 4PL equation relating fluorescence to hydroxyl ion concentration at 𝑟 (Eq. 23). As discussed earlier, this 4PL equation was determined from the constant pH solutions, and use of the equation yields a calculated fluorescence for the mixed sheet and not the slice. To determine the fluorescence for the slice (𝐹𝐼 𝑗,𝑟 ), 𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 is multiplied by 𝛥𝑦 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 ⁄ .The fluorescence for the entire slab, 𝐹𝐼 2𝐿,𝑟 , can be obtained by adding up the calculated fluorescence of each slice contained within the slab (the number of slices for all simulations was equal to 200 over the diffusive slab thickness, -𝐿 to +𝐿). The equation is: where 𝐹𝐼 𝑗,𝑟 has been replaced by Eq. 24. Since 𝛥𝑦 is constant and 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 is also constant at the specific pixel, 𝑟,𝐹𝐼 2𝐿,𝐹𝐼 2𝐿,𝑟 = 𝛥𝑦 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 ∑ (𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 ) 200 𝑗=1(26)The experimental results only provided the fluorescence for the mixed sheet thickness along the radial line at a distance 𝑟 from the impingement zone. Therefore, a comparison of', 'Material and MethodsThe micromixing or diffusive mixing of equal impinging sheets was studied by observing the change in the fluorescence of a pH-sensitive indicator during the diffusion-controlled neutralization of base with acid. A single liquid sheet of dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was caused to impinge upon an equal single liquid sheet of dilute aqueous hydrogen chloride (HCl). The neutralization reaction proceeds as follows:𝐻𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) + 𝑁𝑎𝑂𝐻(𝑎𝑞) → 𝑁𝑎𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻 2 𝑂(20)Photographs of the resulting mixed sheet were taken and the variation of fluorescence intensity with location in the mixed sheet was determined using ImageJ software .The fluorescing agent was added in equal concentrations to all solutions. Equal fluorophore concentrations in all impinging liquids ensured that there were no concentration gradients of fluorophore in the mixed sheet, and therefore, the ""sensing"" of the progress of the instantaneous neutralization reaction was limited only by the diffusion of acid and base. The time required for the transition from the excited state to the ground state with emission of fluorescence was also considered to be ""instantaneous"" since it takes place within 10 -8 seconds .The pH-sensitive fluorophore was umbelliferone, which fluoresces brightly under basic conditions but at a much lower level under acidic conditions . Since umbelliferone is only slightly soluble in water, it was first dissolved in 200 ml of 99%+ ethanol and then added to the solutions yielding a final concentration of 25 ppm by weight. The umbelliferone was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and was specifically labeled as ""suitable for fluorescence indicator, > 98.0% (HPLC)"".The fluorescence intensity, 𝐹𝐼, is a function of', 'for acid impinging upon acid and 𝐹𝐼 for base impinging upon base. This amounts to assuming that the base single sheet is adjacent and adjoined to an acid single sheet and the UV light is passing through both of them (this is only potentially true in the impingement zone where it is assumed that little to no reaction of acid with base has occurred).In Figure , the experimental fluorescence intensity at the end of the impingement zone for acid impinging upon acid is 30.00 gray scale units. For base impinging upon base the value is 128.67 and for acid impinging with base, the value is 101.33. These values are for the mixed sheet formed in the impingement zone, which is approximately twice the thickness of the single sheets.If a base single sheet were adjacent to an acid single sheet in the impingement zone, the calculated value for 𝐹𝐼 would be: where 𝐹𝐼 𝑖,𝑐 is the calculated fluorescence of a combined mixed sheet that consists of an acid single sheet adjoining a base single sheet with UV light passing through this hypothetical mixed sheet. The factor of 2 is included because the 𝐹𝐼 values for acid-acid impingement and base-base impingement are for the mixed sheet in the impingement zone. However, for the acid-base impingement, the acid and base each comprise only half of the thickness of the mixed sheet in the impingement zone.

Yield of isolated products.[a] Determined by 19 F NMR spectroscopy with PhOCF3 as an internal standard.Like the styrene reaction, we conducted some preliminary EPR mechanistic investigations to study the reaction mechanism. Herein, subjecting sodium benzoate to a mixture of PC1 and N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) under blue led irradiation provided the formation of two adducts. The major adduct could be assigned to an O-centred radical formed through the oxidation of the sodium benzoate (g=2.006, aN=13.5G and aH=1.7G present in 65%) (Scheme 7). Based on this preliminary result and the proposed catalytic cycle reported by the Glorius group, we suggest that the following mechanism could take place under our reaction conditions. The organophotocatalytic cycle starts with the oxidation of sodium benzoate to afford the PhCOO radical. This radical undergoes HAT process with the aldehyde starting material to form the desired benzoyl radical, which subsequently reacts with reagent I to deliver the desired product.

To further confirm the need for light, On/Off experiments were conducted and confirmed the stepwise mechanism involved in this transformation (see ESI for details) Scheme 5. Proposed mechanism for the synthesis of vinyl-SCF3 Afterwards, to further exploit the reactivity of reagent I, we decided to investigate the synthesis of benzoyl-SCF3 derivatives under organophotoredox conditions. Access to such compounds has already been demonstrated by reacting Munavalli's reagent and aldehydes under photochemical conditions. Indeed, while the Glorius 15 group reported a dual strategy using an iridium-based photocatalyst in conjunction with catalytic amount of sodium benzoate under blue LED König and co-workers employed decatungstate as photocatalyst under 385 nm LED irradiation. Inspired by these studies, we reacted reagent I and aldehyde 3a in MeCN in the presence of 5 mol% of organophotocatalyst PC1 and 5 mol% of sodium benzoate (PhCOONa) at room temperature under blue LED irradiation. Under these conditions, desired product 4a was obtained in an excellent yield of 97% (Scheme 6).

Pleasingly, both electron donating and electron-withdrawing groups were tolerated under the reaction conditions affording the desired products in excellent yield (up to 91%, compounds 4b-4f, Scheme 6). In contrast, using 2-naphthaldeyde provided the desired product in a low yield of 22% (compounds 4g, Scheme 6).

The reaction mixture was stirred under blue LED irradiation for 16 hours unless otherwise noted. Isolated yields. Upon addition of styrene 1a to the previous reaction mixture, we detected the formation of two adducts reinforcing the formation of the trifluoromethylthio radical intermediate (g=2.006, aN=13.3G and aH=13.3G, a3F=1.9G, present in 81%) as well as a C-centred radical species that could potentially match with structure B (g=2.0056, aN=15.4G and aH=19.7G, present in 11%) (Scheme 4, 2).To get more insight on the reaction mechanism, we performed cyclic voltammetry studies. Herein, addition of one equivalent of sodium bromide shifted the potential of reagent I from -1.97 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) to -1.74 V. This shift confirms the requirement for bromide salt to be used for the reaction to proceed (see optimisation table) and could be associated to the formation of a new adduct . We suggest that the activation of reagent I with bromide anion could likely lead to the in situ formation of BrSCF3 as mentioned in previous studies reported by and Glorius. Based on the mechanism already proposed by Hopkinson and Glorius and our preliminary EPR and cyclic voltammetry investigations, we propose the following mechanism could take place under the reaction conditions. Activation of reagent I with bromide anion leads to the in situ formation of BrSCF3. The exited photocatalyst PC1 reduces this intermediate affording a radical anion that can deliver the key SCF3 radical intermediate. This radical then adds onto the styrene derivative to provide C-centred radical C as demonstrated by EPR.

At the small angles of incidence αi, typically 0.025°, the vertical size, 3 µm, of the focused beam results in a footprint length of typically ca. 7 mm along the surface, probing a statistically relevant electrode area, all within the active surface. For values of αi below a critical angle αc, the penetration depth of the evanescent X-rays in the film is low and the scattering signal originates only from the topmost layer of the photoactive material (Figure ). For αi > αc the X-ray penetration depth in the sample quickly increases, as indicated by the occurrence of diffraction peaks from the FTO substrate. Measuring at αi < αc is therefore essential to determine structural information limited to the surface of the electrode as shown in Figure .

Furthermore, the GISAXS signal from the reference samples of FTO and bare silica do not display the power law decay observed for the CuBi2O4 electrode, therefore confirming that the porosity is indeed located in the CuBi2O4 layer.Insight into the photodegradation process -ex situ. We measure ex-situ the structural changes of CuBi2O4 electrodes after photodegradation. To this end, we investigate two CuBi2O4 electrodes which were treated with either a 24 h immersion in the electrolyte solution and in the absence of applied bias, or with a 4 h chronoamperometry at 0.5 V vs RHE and under illumination. In Figure the respective TS patterns are compared against a pristine CuBi2O4 film pattern. For the treated electrodes, we observe the emergence of a hydrated crystalline BiPO4 phase (space group P3121), which clearly forms even without applied bias and in the dark by a prolonged immersion of the electrode in the electrolyte. The electrode treated with the chronoamperometry additionally displays intense Bragg\'s reflections characteristic of metallic Bi (space group R-3m) as well as traces of metallic Cu phase (space group Fm-3m), both as a result of cathodic photocorrosion. This is further supported by X -ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) at the Cu K-edge of films (Figure ) and inductively', 'at intermediate and later stages of the measurement. This behavior likely results from the onset of BiPO4 deposition at the surface of the electrode, which leads to a local increase of the surface compactness. The value of 𝑛 does not saturate at 40 min, suggesting that the restructuring of the surface may further extend to later times. We additionally analyze GISAXS data obtained during measurements of the open circuit potential (OCP) under chopped light illumination (Figures S21-S28), and account for the transmitted and reflected X-ray intensities by the electrode film. We attribute the dominant change in intensities to a slight, reversible change of incident angle by ±0.0003° upon illumination, while we observe no change in electrode porosity as a result of the OCP measurement.Discussion of photocorrosion mechanism.

Therefore, we can exclude that the Bi formation was induced by the X-ray beam. Interestingly, the appearance of a Bi phase correlates with the decay in measured photocurrent density during the chronoamperometry, as shown in Figure . In the first 8 minutes of chronoamperometry, the photocurrent density rapidly decreases by almost one order of magnitude from around -0.20 mA/cm 2 to just -0.03 mA/cm 2 .

In the first 8 minutes of operation the amplitude of the scattering signal (I(qx,y min)) at low-q values quickly increases and reaches a maximum after 20 min, thus indicating that the bulk porosity increases during the initial stage of CA.

The calculated temperature-composition phase diagram reveals a large miscibility gap inducing spinodal decomposition at equilibrium conditions, with higher Gd substitution (meta)stabilized at higher temperatures. By depositing combinatorial thin films at high effective temperatures using radio frequency co-sputtering, we have achieved the highest Gd 3+ incorporation into the wurtzite phase reported to date, with single-phase compositions at least up to x ≈ 0.25 confirmed by high resolution synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering.

First-principles calculations using density functional theory in conjunction with SQS supercells reveal that the critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82. The calculated mixing free energy indicates that at equilibrium conditions and at temperatures below 1000 K, there is a large miscibility gap and only a few percent of Gd can be incorporated in AlN. Higher (effective) temperatures that can be accessed with non-equilibrium growth methods will enable higher Gd incorporation.

659,"Analysis of the Valence Electronic StructureAzupyrene with its nonalternant -electron system has a much smaller optical gap than its alternant isomer pyrene. This is apparent in the intense yellow color displayed by solutions of azupyrene, whereas solutions of pyrene are colorless (See insets in Figure ). In agreement with the yellow color of azupyrene, the UV/Vis spectrum (Figure ) shows an absorption peak for azupyrene at a photon energy of 2.6 eV, in the blue part of the visible range. Pyrene has its lowest energy peak at a much higher photon energy of 3.7 eV, well outside the visible range. The resulting optical excitation energies, determined from the rising edge of the peak, are 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding a difference of 1.09 eV. Our ab initio calculations within the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) approach (see vertical lines in Figure ) overestimate the absolute excitation energies for both molecules. However, the calculations yield a difference in transition energies of 1.10 eV between azupyrene and pyrene, in excellent agreement with the experiment. It should be noted that while the lowest energy excitation corresponds to the transition from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO→LUMO) in pyrene, this transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and the peak in the visible range has to be attributed to the transition into a higher lying unoccupied orbital (HOMO→LUMO+1).

The HOMO→LUMO dipole transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and therefore the LUMO energy does not control the optical band gap. (It should be noted that the HOMO→LUMO transition might still be responsible for a very weak signal at about 1.8 eV as shown in Figure in the SI, which is neglected for the following calculations.) For pyrene, the HOMO→LUMO transition is allowed and determines the optical band gap. If the difference between the optical band gap and the electronic band gap is to be calculated in a meaningful manner using electronic ""frozen orbital"" transition energies, the LUMO has to be excluded for azupyrene. Accordingly, the DFT-calculated electronic band gap of azupyrene increases from 2.96 eV to 3.62 eV. With this value the difference between the DFT-based ""frozen orbital"" electronic band gap and the (experimental) optical band gap is 1.08 eV (= 3.62 eV -2.54 eV) for azupyrene, while the same difference is only 0.20 eV (= 3.83 eV -3.63 eV) for pyrene. The large deviation between the electronic and optical band gap for azupyrene is a direct consequence of its nonalternant \uf070-electron system. This topological property of azupyrene leads to a localization of the molecular orbitals. When an electron is excited into a higher lying orbital, then its initial and final orbitals can be located in different parts of the molecule, thus decreasing electron-electron repulsion in the excited state and lowering the transition energy. This explanation was already used to explain the color of the prototypical nonalternant molecule azulene.', ""ConclusionOur systematic multi-technique comparison of the organic semiconductor pyrene and its nonalternant isomer azupyrene revealed major topology-related differences of their electronic properties. UPS and NEXAFS show that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of the alternant molecule pyrene, and theory predicts a very similar difference of 0.87 eV. The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding an even larger difference of 1.09 eV. One reason why this difference is larger for azupyrene is due to symmetry selection rules, which result in a forbidden HOMO→LUMO transition and the lack of fluorescence for azupyrene. These special properties of azupyrene's electronic structure are related to the nonalternant topology of its \uf070-electron system. The topology of azupyrene also leads to a more localized charge distribution, visible in the experimental XPS and NMR shifts as well as in the DFT-calculated partial charges, all showing a negative charge surplus at the apices of the 7-membered rings and positive charge at the central C2-unit. The conjugated system of pyrene is best described as a biphenyl with two ethenediyl bridges, whereas azupyrene is a [14]annulene with a central double-bonded C2 unit. This interpretation follows from HOMA considerations, bond length changes, and the vibrational modes seen in experimental and calculated IR spectra. Overall, we found that the topology of the \uf070electron system drastically influences the electronic structure of the two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Those differences in electronic structure are reflected in the absorption and fluorescence behavior, a lower electron-hole binding energy, and a lower barrier to electron-hole separation for azupyrene. The possible application of nonalternant molecules in organic electronic devices is favored by those differences. We propose"", 'carbon K-edge NEXAFS spectra (Figure ) show intense \uf070* resonances at low photon energy (284 to 287 eV) and less intense \uf073* resonances at higher photon energies (>287 eV). The first \uf070* resonance of pyrene has two maxima, which are caused by the C1s→LUMO and C1s→LUMO+1 excitations, as was ascertained by MO-projected NEXAFS simulations (see Figure in the SI and Ref. ). For azupyrene, the individual excitations in the first peak are not resolved, because the corresponding LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals are too close in energy. For both molecules, the MO-projected NEXAFS simulations show that the leading edge of the adsorption peak is determined by the C1s→LUMO excitation.The X-ray absorption edge of azupyrene appears at a lower photon energy by 0.37 eV than that of pyrene, as can be seen in Figure . Since the core-level energies differ only marginally, it can therefore be concluded that the LUMO of azupyrene is lower in energy. Theory also predicts the LUMO of azupyrene to be lower in energy, here the magnitude is 0.60 eV.Combination of the experimental differences of electron addition and removal energies from UPS and NEXAFS data indicate that the electronic band gap is 0.72 eV (= 0.37 eV + 0.35 eV) smaller for azupyrene than for pyrene. For comparison, the calculations yield a value of 0.87 eV for the difference in electronic band gap, which is in good agreement with the experimental finding. In addition, the calculations can provide the absolute electronic band gaps, which are not accessible by the experimental techniques at our disposal. The calculated absolute electronic band gaps are 2.96 eV and 3.83 eV for azupyrene and pyrene, respectively. These values can be compared to the optical band gaps of 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, as determined by UV/Vis,', ""the valence electronic structure in applicationrelated polycrystalline thin films of pyrene and azupyrene.

Furthermore, we discuss the results of NMR and IR spectroscopy together with an analysis according to the HOMA approach.The theoretical methods were always employed on the gas-phase molecules to have the same reference for experiments performed on thin films and on solutions of the molecules. The gas phase calculations additionally offer a more accessible interpretation using the molecular electronic states. However, we performed additional calculations for the molecular crystals with periodic boundary conditions to gauge the influence of intermolecular interactions, which are present in the experiments involving thin films, on the electronic properties.Our study reveals and illustrates the striking influence of the \uf070-electron system's topology on the electronic properties. The nonalternant molecule shows significantly lower electronic and optical band gaps and we found strong indications for lower electron-hole binding energies, which can facilitate electron-hole separation. Applying these results in the form of topological design to the development of new materials for organic electronic devices can open up a new pathway for tuning their properties in a systematic manner.

Third, we have identified that the D159N and E402K mutations are connected with the active site movement.', 'Finally, we show that mutation R229W does not alter the balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area in the protein, but does affect the active site dynamics. Our findings open up new opportunities for treatment of mannosidosis.Human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase (LAMAN, EC 3.2.1.24) belongs to the Zn 2+ -dependent aspartic glycosidase hydrolase family GH38. hLAMAN catalyzes the cleavage of end-terminal mannosidic linkages α(1→2), α(1→3), and α(1→6) from glycoproteins (Figure ). hLAMAN has a large globular domain (962 amino acids) with the active site centered in the helix core (Figure ). The total or partial loss of this enzyme activity by missense mutations is behind the diagnosis of the rare genetic disorder alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA). MANSA is grouped with other lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), and, although it has a very low incidence (1 out of 500,000), this number could increase because of undiagnosed patients. MANSA is characterized by several symptoms as intellectual disability, unusual facial features, or skeletal anomalies, amongst others. Despite the remarkable severity of some of the symptoms in MANSA, there is no permanent cure yet. Brown marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy -via administration of the recombinant enzyme (i.e. alpha Velmanase, Lamzede®) <ref', 'helix) and a change in the orientation of the side chain of Q444, residue located close to one of the Zn 2+ -coordinating residues, H445 (Figure ). We further analyzed the interactions of the other 48 detected positions with the surrounding residues (second sphere, Figure ). As outcome, we found out that up to 14 of these 48 positions have a direct interaction with known positions where missense mutations are reported. As example, the residue identified in these studies, F337, forms a backbone-backbone hydrogen bond with H200, a π-cation interaction with Lys373, and interestingly, an edge π-cation interaction with the side chain of R229 (Figure ). The former position is listed within the reported missense mutations. Thus, we ran MD simulations of the R229W variant as we did for the wild-type enzyme in order to analyze its molecular interactions. The side chain of R229 has as main interactions two hydrogen bonds with the backbone of E234 and the side chain of Q237, respectively, and a salt-bridge with the D225 carboxylate. In the R229W variant, all these three interactions are lost. Finally, we measured the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the surface accessible solvent area (SASA) in hLAMAN since it has been proposed that the impact of some specific mutations could alter it. Thus, we monitored the degree of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components on SASA along 1.5-\uf06ds MD simulation trajectories for the wild-type, D74E, and R229W systems. In the latter case, the loss of key interactions, as described above, could bring about a reconfiguration of the exposed surface of the protein. In Figure we represent both hydrophobic and hydrophilic SASA populations using violin plots. No significant differences were found between the three systems. The variant R229W', 'CV1Additionally, the distances dHa-Og and dC1-On in the D74E ER complex slightly increase 0.12 and 0.08 Å, respectively (Table and Figure ). Overall, these changes in the Zn 2+ -coordination sphere and in the puckering of the reactant end up in significant increase in the energy barrier of the catalyzed reaction by the D74E variant. Furthermore, we wanted to look for other mutations on hLAMAN that may affect the conformation of the active site. To do this, we computed bond-to-bond propensities in the wild-type hLAMAN using the server ProteinLens to detect distal regions in the enzyme connected with the movement of the active site. In Figure and Table , we highlight the 50 residues identified to have a significant correlation with the active site within a 95 % quantile score. Interestingly, the algorithm detected two out of 26 known sequence positions related to catalytically-deficient hLAMAN variants: D159 and E402.Mutations in these positions drive to inactive variants (D159N and E402K) that, although they can fold and reach the lysosome, cannot process oligosaccharides. Visual inspection of our atomic model for wild-type hLAMAN indicates that the change D \uf0ae N on position 159 (at 10 Å from the active site) will prevent the dual interaction of the aspartic carboxylate with the amide hydrogens of A161 and A162 in the enzyme variant (Figure ). More critical is the change in position 402, where the introduction of a lysine residue in the position of a glutamic acid creates an electrostatic repulsion with the R403 amidinium group (located on the same helix) and a change in the orientation of the side chain of Q444, residue located close to one of', ""may be an additional ETS conformation in GHs.

Prompted by our findings, we were committed to understand the effect of some of the missense mutations with significant impact on hLAMAN activity. This is the case of the D74E variant, where one extra methylene group is inserted into the side chain of this Zn 2+ -coordination sphere residue. First, we found out that the puckering of the reactive ring in BMA shows a different conformational energy profile than when bound to the wild-type counterpart (Figure vs Figure ). Now, the E5 conformation is energetically unfavorable towards a B2,5 conformation. We simulated the reaction mechanism for the same substrate BMA. We obtained a DFTB3 energy barrier of 12.3 kcal mol -1 , 5.1 kcal mol -1 (+75 %) larger than for the wild-type (Figure ). The height of the barrier increases up to a value of 37.3 kcal mol -1 via the NEB method (GFN2-xTB/ff19SB, Table vs. Table ). For this D74E variant, the observed mechanism follows the itinerary B2,5 → B2,5 → 1 S5. Looking in detail at the structures along the MFEP, the major changes respect to the wild-type counterpart are observed in the Zn 2+ -coordination sphere in the ER and ETS complexes. The introduction of one extra methylene in the side chain of the acid residue in position 74 pushes apart the 2'-OH of the BMA -1 ring from the Zn 2+ -coordination sphere (Figure ). Now, the two carboxylic oxygen atoms of E74 coordinate the ion metal.

QUBE force fields have been derived for 109 small organic molecules, and yield mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm 3 , 0.79 kcal/mol and 1.17 kcal/mol in computed liquid density, heat of vaporization and free energy of hydration. These results are competitive with standard transferable force fields, which have been extensively fit to properties such as these.To achieve our goal of employing the QUBE force field in computer-aided drug design applications, we require a compatible protein force field. Since the non-bonded parametrization strategy employed in QUBE is very different to that used in the standard biomolecular force fields (e.g. AMBER, OPLS, CHARMM), there is no reason to believe that they are compatible. However, by implementing the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameter derivation methods in the ONETEP linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) software, we have shown that it is feasible to derive these charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for entire proteins. In this way, the number of fitting parameters is substantially reduced, and we have a consistent parametrization approach that can be applied to both small and large molecules, including entire biomolecular assemblies. Since, in this approach, all non-bonded parameters are derived from a single QM calculation, both the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters naturally include the native state polarization effects of the environment. Importantly, we have shown that protein charges derived using DDEC electron density partitioning recreate the underlying QM electrostatic potential with high accuracy,",Explanatory,For how many small organic molecules have QUBE force fields been derived?,109 small organic molecules,Easy,"['QUBE force fields have been derived for 109 small organic molecules, and yield mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm 3 , 0.79 kcal/mol and 1.17 kcal/mol in computed liquid density, heat of vaporization and free energy of hydration.']","[[241, 469]]","['Molecular Dynamics SimulationsFigure shows the steps required to set up a QUBE protein force field for a MD simulation. As in Section 2.1, the ONETEP linear-scaling DFT software is used to compute the ground state electron density of the five proteins, and assign the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters from the partitioned atomic electron densities. Consistent with the QUBE small molecule approach, every atom in the protein is assigned bespoke non-bonded parameters derived from the quantum mechanical electron density. To model polarization effects in the condensed phase, the electron density is computed first in vacuum, then using an implicit solvent model with a dielectric constant of 80. The iPol approach used in AMBER ff15ipq is then employed, with all non-bonded parameters set halfway between their vacuum and condensed phase values. The purpose of this approach, as well as overcoming issues associated with closing of the electronic band gap in large system sizes, is to account for electrostatics and induction in the condensed phase in an effective manner using a fixed point charge force field. Typical computational requirements for a QM calculation on a small protein (≈ 1000 atoms) are approximately 2000 cpuhrs. In order to provide a consistent and computationally efficient approach to assigning the non-bonded parameters, we recommend minimizing the experimental structure using a standard transferable force field in explicit water prior to the DFT calculation. In this study, we used the OPLS-AA/M force field for the initial minimization. Following non-bonded parameter assignment, bond, angle and torsion parameters were assigned as described in Section 2 based', 'Development and Validation of the QUBE Protein Force Field Molecular mechanics force field parameters for macromolecules, such as proteins, are traditionally fit to reproduce experimental properties of small molecules, and thus they neglect system-specific polarization. In this paper, we introduce a complete protein force field that is designed to be compatible with the QUantum mechanical BEspoke (QUBE) force field by deriving non-bonded parameters directly from the electron density of the specific protein under study. The main backbone and sidechain protein torsional parameters are re-derived in this work by fitting to quantum mechanical dihedral scans for compatibility with QUBE non-bonded parameters. Software is provided for the preparation of QUBE input files. The accuracy of the new force field, and the derived torsional parameters, are tested by comparing the conformational preferences of a range of peptides and proteins with experimental measurements. Accurate backbone and sidechain conformations are obtained in molecular dynamics simulations of dipeptides, with NMR J coupling errors comparable to the widely-used OPLS force field. In simulations of five folded proteins, the secondary structure is generally retained and the NMR J coupling errors are similar to standard transferable force fields, although some loss of the experimental structure is observed in certain regions of the proteins. With several avenues for further development, the use of system-specific nonbonded force field parameters is a promising approach for next-generation simulations of biological molecules.', 'which would be problematic if the charges show strong conformation dependence. However, Manz and Sholl have demonstrated that DDEC charges are transferable between different conformations of a molecule (as measured by their ability to recreate the QM electrostatic potential), and they conclude that the charges are suitable for the construction of flexible force fields. Furthermore, it should be noted that atoms-in-molecule electron density partitioning lends itself naturally to the derivation of both off-site charges to model electron anisotropy (such as lone pairs and σ-holes) and atomic polarizabilities, though we have not yet investigated a fully polarizable force field.In keeping with our goal of deriving force field parameters directly from QM, rather than fitting to experiment, we have supplemented the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameters with harmonic bond and angle parameters derived directly from the QM Hessian matrix. There are a number of methods available for deriving bonded parameters from the QM Hessian matrix, but our recent adaptation of the Seminario method (which we name the modified Seminario method) is conceptually quite straightforward whilst yielding parameters that reproduce QM vibrational frequencies with a mean unsigned error of 49 cm -1 , below that of OPLS (59 cm -1 ). Collectively, we have named these methods the QUantum mechanical BEspoke (QUBE) force field. This name reflects the fact that force field parameters are derived by the user specifically for the small molecule under study, directly from QM calculations. We have released a software toolkit (QUBEKit) that facilitates the derivation of small organic molecule force field parameters, and also', 'emerges is that this first generation quantum mechanical bespoke force field is an improvement over legacy OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L force fields, but is out-performed by the most recent OPLS-AA/M force field for simulated dynamics of folded proteins in their native state. While we have previously shown that DDEC charges are not too dependent on small conformation changes, 28 further investigation is needed to establish the utility of QUBE for protein folding simulations.Hence, although we have outlined our roadmap to future improvements, a natural question is: where can the QUBE protein force field be used now (especially given the higher cost of parameterization compared to transferable force fields)? Importantly, it has been shown previously that the use of system-specific force field charges leads to improvements in binding energetics of small molecules, and reproduction of the QM electrostatic potential for both small molecules 27 and proteins. Therefore, although simulated protein backbone dynamics is an important test, we envisage the QUBE small molecule and protein force field being particularly important for the study of intermolecular interactions in the condensed phase.Indeed, QUBE was originally developed to provide, by construction, a compatible protein and small molecule force field for computer-aided drug design, where an accurate surface electrostatic potential of the protein is crucial. In this regard, the absolute binding free energies between the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme and six benzene analogs have been recently computed using QUBE with a mean unsigned error of 0.85 kcal/mol, which compares very favorably with OPLS-AA/M (1.26 kcal/mol).

Since the reference QM potential energy scans are performed in the gas phase, we have decided to derive QUBE force field charges and Lennard-Jones parameters from the vacuum electron density (rather than in an implicit solvent). The assumption here is that the required correction to the MM potential energy surface is approximately the same in the gas and condensed phases.Charge and Lennard-Jones parameters were derived from the QM ground state electron density using the DDEC scheme as implemented in the ONETEP code (Section 2.1). As discussed previously, DDEC charges show low, but non-zero, conformational dependence. To account for this, the non-bonded parameters were derived for multiple conformations of each dipeptide and averaged. Input files for the full set of dipeptide structures are provided in the Supporting Information. Non-bonded parameters on identical atoms (for example, hydrogen atoms in a methyl group) were symmetrized. It should be noted that only atom-centered charges were used in this work, though off-site charges to model anisotropic electron density distributions, particularly on sulfur atoms, may lead to improvements in future work.

108,"revealed surprisingly that the enzyme compensates for the stability gaps between the intermediate complex and product duplex primarily by raising the stability of the nicked duplex, thereby helping to overcome product inhibition. In support of this observation, Lohman and coworkers' recently revealed that T4 DNA ligase bound more strongly to a nicked duplex over a duplex (Knet,nick = 2.5 -3.3 x 10 8 M -1 and Knet,duplex = 2.8 -7.25 x 10 6 M -1 , respectively). This difference in magnitude of 10 2 in the enzyme binding affinity can help explain how the KA, prod/KA, inter ratio in the absence of the enzyme shrank from 10 3 -10 4 to 10 2 in the presence of the enzyme. The KA from the kinetic model contains contributions from both the intrinsic binding affinity of the DNA and the binding affinity of the enzyme for the complexes, so both of these effective Kprod and Kinter values are expected to increase in the presence of the enzyme. The change in Kinter is consistent with a higher binding constant for the intermediate complex in the presence of enzyme. Although the effective Kprod (with enzyme) is slightly lower than the K of the product duplex from ITC, we believe that this <4-fold difference is not significant, and that the stability of the product duplex is essentially unaffected by the presence or absence of ligase. ).

We attribute this difference in kbi from our ligation experiments at lower temperatures and the kinetic model of LIDA at 30 °C to our simplifying assumptions of the binding affinities of the fragment duplexes as well as the temperaturedependence of the enzyme binding to these fragment duplexes.The ratio of the rate constants k+1/k-1 from the kinetic fit yielded an association constant for the intermediate complexes DNA-I・IIap and DNA-II・IbP of 2.0 ± 0.3 x 10 5 M -1 .

Simulations were performed wherein the hybridization rate constants were systematically increased or decreased by factors of 10 from the values determined from the best fit. This resulted in increases or decreases in the intermediate or product duplex KA values by one order of magnitude (Figure ). For the intermediate complexes, Figure shows the change in the hybridization rate constant (k+1) while Figure describes the changes in the dissociation rate constant (k-1). When the stability of the intermediate complex was one order of magnitude higher by increasing k+1 by a factor of 10 the formation of DNA-I and DNA-II was much faster (short, dashed line, Figure ). However, when the stability of the intermediate complex was reduced by one order of magnitude (0.1 x k+1), self-replication was not observed (long dashed line, Figure ). Similar results were observed when the affinity constant was changed by varying the k-1 values (Figure ). In contrast, when the product duplex affinity was changed by increasing or decreasing product hybridization rate (k+2) by 10-fold, the self-replication of DNA-I and DNA-II were only slightly affected (Figure ). In contrast, when the k-2 value was changed, it resulted in a much bigger impact on the cross-catalysis. As k-2 was increased to 10 x k-2, the dissociation of both DNA-I and DNA-II was much faster while when k-2 was reduced to 0.1 x k-2, there was no self-replication observed (Figure <ref type=""figure""', ""ConclusionIn conclusion, it has been shown that the addition of an abasic group at the ligation site instead of thymidine decreases the product duplex affinity constants for a particular 18mer duplex from 10 12 M -1 to 10 8 M -1 and the intermediate complex from 10 4 -10 5 M -1 to 10 3 -10 4 M -1 at 30 °C, the optimal replication temperature for this sequence. However, in the presence of an enzyme, the stability gap between the abasic-containing product and intermediate complexes is reduced from 10 4 -10 5 to 10 2 . We attribute this surprising difference to the stronger affinity of the enzyme for the intermediate rather than product complexes. This finding explains how we observe very fast selfreplication with LIDA despite the expected product inhibition. Indeed, our kinetic model reveals how rapid self-replication can be achieved even when the affinity constants are higher for the product duplex and the intermediate complex; a fast enough kcat is required together with a high enough affinity constant for the intermediate complex. Altogether, both the abasic group at the ligation site (which preferentially destabilizes the product duplex) and T4 DNA ligase (which preferentially stabilizes the intermediate) play significant roles in achieving rapid isothermal DNA self-replication. Therefore, a successful oligonucleotide self-replication system should incorporate product destabilization and a catalyst that favors the intermediate complex to further overcome product inhibition. These results can guide efforts to generate autonomous self-replicating oligonucleotides that use chemical rather than enzymatic ligation.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.

The IIaP strand contains the destabilizing abasic group at the 5'"", 'k-2 was reduced to 0.1 x k-2, there was no self-replication observed (Figure ). These results suggested that product inhibition is important as the rate of dissociation of the template:product strongly influences the success of the self-replication. Yet the overall stability of the intermediate complex also plays a significant role, which had until now been overlooked. In addition, simulations were conducted with 5 x kcat and 0.2 kcat to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the rate of ligation. When the kcat is 5 times faster than the value determined from our best fit of the data, the self-replication was much faster than what we observed. Conversely, the ligation rate was much slower when kcat was reduced by a factor of (0.2 x kcat), resulting in slow amplification of the templates (Figure ). These simulations are consistent with previous work that showed a strong dependence of replication on the magnitude of kcat of ligation. These simulations reveal two important take-home messages for developers of nonenzymatic self-replicating systems: they should focus on ways to stabilize the intermediate complex as well as ways to destabilize the product duplex and select rapid ligation strategies. Regarding the latter, very little product was observed within the first 7200 seconds (2 hours) of reaction when kcat was reduced to 0.1kcat (simulation not shown).Next, to provide some insight as to how the presence of the abasic affected the interactions with the enzyme, we determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat and Km for the ligation reaction in Cycle I for the system with and without the abasic group. The previous report on the affinity of T4 DNA ligase for nicked versus complete duplexes did not contain abasic groups. This previous work indicated that nicked ligation by T4 DNA ligase', 'target=""#b49"">50 This previous work indicated that nicked ligation by T4 DNA ligase exhibited substrate inhibition. Our rate versus substrate concentration data were also best described by an uncompetitive substrate inhibition model (Figure ); the resulting Km and Ki values indicated that the abasic-containing system (Ab) had similar enzyme affinity and inhibition behavior as that of the thymidine-containing system (T) (Km(Ab) = 0.3 ± 0.2 µM; Km(T) = 0.7 ± 0.4 µM; Ki(Ab) = 2 ± 1 µM Ki(T) = 1.1 ± 0.7 µM). although it appears that the presence of the abasic group did decrease the rate constant for the ligation step (kcat(Ab) = 0.07 ± 0.02 s -1 ; kcat(T) = 0.3 ± 0.1 s -1 ).The overall similarity in Michaelis-Menten parameters for the systems with and without abasic groups suggests that the abasic site does not impinge on the enzyme affinity for the ternary or product duplexes, in support of our findings from the kinetic model.']","['Catalysis', 'Enzymatic catalysis']",1127,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9493267781615192,1.1102230246251563e-16,['how']

The development of quantum algorithms for molecular excited states is more challenging compared to the ground-state algorithms. The existing quantum algorithms for excited states often require a large number of qubits and gate operations, which precludes their application to larger systems. This is because the excited states often have more complex wavefunctions (open-shell, multi-configurational) even when the corresponding ground states are well behaved. Furthermore, in contrast to the ground state (which is unique in the sense that it is the lowest-energy state), there are many excited states, so the quantum algorithms should be capable of targeting a specific state (or states)e.g., the lowest energy states or states in a particular energy range, states of a particular symmetry/spin, states of a particular character, etc.The success of the VQE algorithm for ground-state calculations has inspired extensions to excited states, leading to variational quantum deflation (VQD) , subspace-search VQE (SSVQE) , and other algorithms .

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSIn this contribution, we presented the implementation of the Davidson algorithm and its variational variant within the quantum version of EOM-CC for computing electronically excited states. We tested the method, named qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson and qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson/Variational, on four systems: H 2 /6-31G, H 4 /STO-3G, LiH/STO-3G, and H 2 O/STO-3G(FC) showing good agreements with the energies obtained from EOM-VQE .The Davidson implementation of the qEOM-UCCSD algorithm provides the advantage over the qEOM and EOM-VQE by reducing the working Hilbert space significantly. The classic Davidson method iteratively interacts with the outcome from the quantum devices and provides feedback to grow the ansatz (vector space) to prepare desired quantum states.The implementation provides several advantages compared to the currently available excitedstate methods in quantum computing. First, qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson significantly reduces the computational demand for classical diagonalization step, because the dimension of the resulting subspace Hamiltonian only spanned by a few guess vectors. In the case of its variational variant, the Davidson algorithm provides the certain electronic configurations that are expected to contribute to the target excited states. Therefore, it introduces a significantly smaller number of variational parameters resulting in a significantly reduced searching space.In addition, similarly to the classical variant, the presented Davidson algorithm produces the excited state of the desired spatial or spin symmetry (in the case of the closed-shell references). The qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson can target the specific group of transitions by defining suitable subspace vectors and can be extended to target higher-energy states or specific transitions . Apart from the advantages of using', 'D. Gray code decompositionThe ground state is the lowest energy eigenstate. The existing state preparation schemes, such as UCCSD and hardware-efficient ansatz , are designed to effectively search the Hilbert space of a quantum system. They are commonly used to provide trial wavefunctions in the VQE method for searching the ground state. Excited-state preparation schemes require additional features compared to that of the ground state. For example, the excitedstate ansatz should be capable of populating particular electronic configurations out of the entire Hilbert space (e.g., singlet-coupled HOMO-LUMO excitation). In addition, the ansatz should be able to easily adjust the components of a desired quantum state. Consider, for instance, the H 2 /6-31G example for which the number of all possible electronic configurations is 8 2 . To compute the S 1 state (at 1 Å bondlength), we need to prepare the superposition of two singly excited configurations (excitation from σ to σ * with respect to the reference vacuum state |11000000⟩) with the equal weights as an initial guess vector |b 1 ⟩. In the qubit representation, the initial guess vector is|b 1 ⟩ = 1 √ 2 (|01100000⟩ -|10010000⟩),(32)where |0⟩ and |1⟩ represent unoccupied and occupied spin-orbitals, respectively. Here, we map the spin-orbitals onto the qubits in the top-to-bottom order, such that the lowest energy orbitals are at the top, to be consistent with our implementation using OpenFermion. As per Eqs. ( ) and (33), one needs to design unitary operations that transform an arbitrary qubit state ⊗ n i=1 |0⟩ into a particular superposition state, i.e., the quantum state consisting of particular excited Slater determinants. In addition, the relative phases between', 'overlap between the previously obtained solutions and the current target state. The minimization of the VQD cost function ensures the mutual orthogonality of the computed eigenstates. Thus, the algorithm entails sequential calculations of the states. Importantly, these approaches do not guarantee resolving the full energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian, especially for near-degenerate states. Essential feature of the VQE-based approaches is the need to design the ansatz that effectively differentiates each eigenstate of the Hamiltonian from other states.In the classical quantum chemistry, the evaluation of excited states is also challenging . Among popular wavefunction-based approaches is the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) ansatz . In the complete many-body limit (i.e., when up to N -electron excitations are included), EOM-CC becomes identical to full configuration interaction (FCI)-the exact solution in the given one-electron basis set. In the case of the truncated many-electron basis, EOM-CC is superior to CI due to the incorporation of correlation through a similarity transformation, which also makes the method size intensive. Quantum adaptations of the EOM ansatz (qEOM) have been implemented and tested . In contrast to the standard EOM-CC, the reference wavefunction of its quantum counterpart comes from the groundstate VQE calculation with the UCC (unitary coupled-cluster) ansatz .

While several developments have shown promising results for ground-state simulations, extending the algorithms to excited states remains challenging. This paper presents two costefficient excited-state algorithms inspired by the classic Davidson algorithm. We implemented the Davidson method into the quantum version of the equation-of-motion unitary coupled-cluster (qEOM-UCC) excited-state method adapted for quantum hardware.

In the first 8 minutes of operation the amplitude of the scattering signal (I(qx,y min)) at low-q values quickly increases and reaches a maximum after 20 min, thus indicating that the bulk porosity increases during the initial stage of CA. This result likely comes from the consumption of CuBi2O4 electrode material and the growth of small metallic Bi deposits. The exponent 𝑛 of the power law 𝑞 #' , obtained from the fit, measures the ruggedness or dimensionality of the surface. During the CA, 𝑛 varies between 2 and 3, which are typical values for non-smooth interfaces probed at low q. After a steeper decline at the beginning of the CA, 𝑛 slowly increases, indicating that the contribution of compact deposits to the total GISAXS signal We found that the abrupt drop of the photocurrents occurring during the first few minutes of the chronoamperometric tests (Figure and Figure ) is dominated by the consumption of CuBi2O4 and the concurrent formation of metallic Bi at the surface of the electrode. This results from a cathodic photocorrosion process, in which the photogenerated electrons are consumed for the reduction of lattice Bi 3+ ions into Bi 0 , which segregates and crystallizes as a metallic Bi phase (eq. 1).cathodic photocorrosion (fast): Bi 3+ + 3e -⇌ Bi 0 (eq. 1) (e -= photogenerated electrons)The quick formation of metallic Bi is not limited by use of a LED illumination but was also determined for a CuBi2O4 electrodes undergoing chronoamperometry under simulated solar radiation (Figure and Table ).",Predictive,What does the exponent 𝑛 measure in the context of general surface analysis?,The exponent 𝑛 measures the ruggedness or dimensionality of surfaces.,Easy,"['The exponent 𝑛 of the power law 𝑞#, obtained from the fit, measures the ruggedness or dimensionality of the surface.']","[[429, 548]]","['of the electrode, it is not possible to pinpoint which phenomena are responsible for the abrupt drop in photocurrents within the first minutes of chronoamperometry. For this, we perform time-resolved X-ray scattering and concurrently measure the CuBi2O4 electrode activity. We record simultaneous TS and SAXS data with an angle of incidence αi = 0.025°, during chronoamperometry at 0.5 V vs. RHE as shown in Figure . Under applied illumination and bias, we immediately observe a rapidly decreasing intensity of the reflections characteristic for CuBi2O4 in the TS signal. Simultaneously, we observe a new feature at q = 1.92 Å -1 , which corresponds to the (012) reflection of metallic Bi. During the first 40 minutes, we observe neither formation of BiPO4 nor Cu. This is not surprising since the Cu content in the ex situ sample, based on XANES studies shown in Figure , is only 1.5%, which is below the detection limit of TS. To quantify the respective contribution of the CuBi2O4 and Bi phases, we Fourier transformed the X-ray total scattering signal into the so-called atomic pair distribution function (PDF, G(r)). We then refine a two-phase structural model of CuBi2O4 and Bi against the experimental G(r). The background subtraction and PDF modelling and refinement procedures are reported in Figure -17 and Table . Figure shows an example of the two-phase PDF refinement result obtained after 40 minutes of chronoamperometry. The two-phase PDF model with CuBi2O4 and Bi provides a good fit to the experimental data with RW of 0.110, and does not indicate the presence of any additional amorphous or locally-ordered structures.

Furthermore, the GISAXS signal from the reference samples of FTO and bare silica do not display the power law decay observed for the CuBi2O4 electrode, therefore confirming that the porosity is indeed located in the CuBi2O4 layer.Insight into the photodegradation process -ex situ. We measure ex-situ the structural changes of CuBi2O4 electrodes after photodegradation. To this end, we investigate two CuBi2O4 electrodes which were treated with either a 24 h immersion in the electrolyte solution and in the absence of applied bias, or with a 4 h chronoamperometry at 0.5 V vs RHE and under illumination. In Figure the respective TS patterns are compared against a pristine CuBi2O4 film pattern. For the treated electrodes, we observe the emergence of a hydrated crystalline BiPO4 phase (space group P3121), which clearly forms even without applied bias and in the dark by a prolonged immersion of the electrode in the electrolyte. The electrode treated with the chronoamperometry additionally displays intense Bragg\'s reflections characteristic of metallic Bi (space group R-3m) as well as traces of metallic Cu phase (space group Fm-3m), both as a result of cathodic photocorrosion. This is further supported by X -ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) at the Cu K-edge of films (Figure ) and inductively', 'at intermediate and later stages of the measurement. This behavior likely results from the onset of BiPO4 deposition at the surface of the electrode, which leads to a local increase of the surface compactness. The value of 𝑛 does not saturate at 40 min, suggesting that the restructuring of the surface may further extend to later times. We additionally analyze GISAXS data obtained during measurements of the open circuit potential (OCP) under chopped light illumination (Figures S21-S28), and account for the transmitted and reflected X-ray intensities by the electrode film. We attribute the dominant change in intensities to a slight, reversible change of incident angle by ±0.0003° upon illumination, while we observe no change in electrode porosity as a result of the OCP measurement.Discussion of photocorrosion mechanism. Our operando X-ray scattering experiments, together with ex-situ XANES and ICP-MS, allow us to outline the multiple reaction pathways and their respective time scales determining the overall photocorrosion process of CuBi2O4 films during PEC operation (Figure6).

We measure TS and SAXS simultaneously in grazing incidence to reveal structural modification close to the CuBi2O4-electrolyte interface. We show that under illumination and applied bias the CuBi2O4 electrodes quickly undergo a cathodic photocorrosion process which determines the formation of a segregating metallic Bi phase. This process takes place on a time scale of only few minutes after beginning of the chronoamperometry and correlates with a decrease of around one order of magnitude in the observed photocurrents. Moreover, additional degradation processes occur on slower time scales: formation of metallic Cu and dissolution in the electrolyte as an effect of both anionic photocorrosion and acidic dissolution. The two phenomena cause a steady release of Cu 2+ ions in solution as well as the crystallization of BiPO4 branched structures at the surface of the electrode due to the interaction of the releasing Bi 3+ ions with the phosphate species in the electrolyte. The formation of an insulating BiPO4 layer is likely responsible for the slow decrease in the measured photocurrents at intermediate and later stages of the chronoamperometry.In summary, our study shows that the high-energy X-ray scattering can probe structural information ranging from atomic to nanometer length scales in a realistic experimental environment, thus allowing to simultaneously correlate chemical and morphological modification of the film electrode with changes of photocurrent.

In this way, static investigations can often establish heuristic models of photoreactions. Equipped with modern computational resources and efficient quantum chemistry programs, such approaches have become affordable to allow even screening of large libraries of photoactive compounds, albeit somewhat restricted to the usage of low-cost black-box electronic structure methods. Beyond the heuristic models, more insight into the mechanisms of photoreactions can be gained by simulating their dynamics explicitly. Depending on the problem of interest, different techniques exist to simulate the nuclear motion of a molecule on the potential energy surfaces of its electronic states. For small molecules or reactions depending only on a small number of nuclear degrees-of-freedom, highly accurate quantum wave-packet dynamics can be employed , while for larger-sized problems typically mixed-quantum-classical approaches such as nonadiabatic molecular dynamics are employed.

For transition metal complexes, despite their typically large number of vibrational degrees of freedom and many close-lying electronic states, it becomes affordable to screen the nonadiabatic dynamics of many individual ones in order to test and establish design principles to improve their photophysical and photochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate this by screening the photophysics of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes derived from VCl 3 (ddpd). This complex, after excitation from the triplet ground state and following intersystem crossing to the singlet manifold, shows singlet-to-triplet phosphorescence in the nearinfrared region. Based on an analysis of the relaxation mechanism of VCl 3 (ddpd), we developed the hypothesis that by increasing the ligand-field strength in the complex could shift the electronic states to modify the mechanism in such a way as to lead to a higher phosphorescence yield. This was to be achieved by channeling more population from the triplet to the singlet states as well as reducing the amount of singlet-to-triplet reverse intersystem crossing that reduces the population available for phosphorescence.We then tested our hypothesis in two steps. First, we designed 18 complexes based on design principles established for other 3dmetal complexes with large ligand-field splitting. Thereby we found that strategies of including ligands that are strong σ -donors or both σ and π donors are particularly successful.

Applied to electronically excited states, on-the-fly computed machine-learning potentials have both enabled nanosecond-timescale nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and screening of large compounds classes of organic molecules. For excited-state properties of transition-metal complexes, machine-learning approaches so far are scarce and lacking behind.

However, we believe that modifications by C16 FA and VLCFAs contribute to membrane permeabilization differently during necroptosis. We previously showed that VLCFAs interact with membranes and disrupt their integrity in model liposomes and molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the modest increases of VLCFAs during necroptosis, we proposed that the incorporation of VLCFAs into proteins can facilitate their recruitment to defined membrane domains and allow high local concentrations of these lipids at the membrane and perturb membrane integrity . Translocation of pMLKL oligomers to the plasma membrane is driven by electrostatic interactions between the oligomer interface and negatively charged phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)-rich membrane domains. Several PIP species are known to be actively involved in cell signaling cascades, both in endogenous processes as well as in mechanisms of action of viruses and other pathogens.

Our results show for the first time the differential protein fatty acylation by a VLCFA during necroptosis and suggests a novel mechanism of membrane recruitment and maintenance of pMLKL in this process.', 'We also showed that VLCFAs have a higher propensity to disturb membrane packing in liposomes and in cells most likely due to interleaflet interdigitation. One intriguing observation was that in liposomes and during molecular dynamics simulations, high concentrations of VLCFAs were required to induce membrane permeabilizations whereas the intracellular concentration required for plasma membrane permeabilization was much lower. These observations suggest that VLCFAs can achieve high local membrane concentrations in cells during necroptosis. We envisioned that one way in which VLCFAs can reach high local membrane concentration was through their incorporation to proteins and the recruitment of the protein-lipid complex to distinct membrane locales. Since fatty acylation by saturated VLCFAs is understudied, we utilized ω-alkynyl VLCFAs to investigate the covalent modification of proteins with VLCFA in both control and necroptotic cells and found that certain proteins may exhibit increased labeling with VLCFAs during necroptosis. In this work, we identify the proteins that are acylated by VLCFAs using a clickable fatty acid analog and investigated the involvement of acylation by VLCFAs in necroptosis. We first carried out quantitative proteomics with a unique IonStar approach to identify proteins that are differentially fatty acylated during this process. We observed that there was an overall decrease in proteins that are acylated by VLCFAs (referred to as VLCFAcylated here on) during necroptosis. However, importantly, MLKL and pMLKL were among the proteins that were VLCFAcylated in necroptotic cells, but not in control cells. Enrichment analysis highlighted the involvement of the endocytic/lysosomal pathway during necroptosis.

This permeabilization is responsible for the inflammatory properties of necroptosis and is critical for disease states involving this process. We previously showed that very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are functionally involved in necroptosis, potentially through protein fatty acylation. Here, we define the scope of protein acylation by saturated VLCFAs during necroptosis. We show that mixed lineage kinase like protein (MLKL) and phosphoMLKL, key proteins for membrane permeabilization, are exclusively acylated during necroptosis.Reducing the levels of VLCFAs decreases their membrane recruitment, suggesting that acylation by VLCFAs contributes to their membrane localization. Acylation of phosphoMLKL occurs downstream of phosphorylation and oligomerization and appears to be, in part, mediated by ZDHHC5 (a palmitoyl transferase). We also show that disruption of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis increases cell viability during necroptosis, likely by removing phosphoMLKL from the plasma membrane.']","['Biomedical engineering and technology', 'Regenerative medicine']",767,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9313145064287962,1.1102230246251563e-16,['why']

The aforementioned fitting process was repeated to obtain another PES, denoted as PESH'. Then the QCT calculations were carried out on PESH and PESH' to yield reaction probabilities. As shown in Figure3a, the two PESs yield almost identical reaction probabilities for the title reaction, indicating that PESH is well converged with respect to the number of training points. Indeed, these additional out-of-sample points have been well described by the PESH, as shown in Figure3b.

The smaller the difference between the low-level DFT and the high-level CCSD(T)-F12a, the cheaper the cost to develop the correction PES.

First, the selected lowlevel DFT method should cover the same configuration space as the high level. Or else, the entire dataset, sampled according to the DFT level, may be not sufficient for the final PES at the target level. Second, the difference between the DFT method and the CCSD(T)-F12a should have the same trend throughout for the entire data.

There is no clear correlation between them. The energy range of ΔVHL-LL, roughly 30 kcal mol -1 , is much smaller than the DFT energy range of 160 kcal mol -1 , which ensures that only a small number of training points are needed to correct the DFT dataset, as mentioned above.

Depositing energy in some reactant modes can enhance the reactivity, while others with additional energy have little effect on the reaction, and even inhibit the reaction. This so called mode specificity is of great importance in chemistry, because it sheds light on how to control chemical processes. Thus, it has been extensively investigated in various gaseous reactions and reactions at gas-solid interfaces. In the title reaction, the two same reactants HO2 can abstract hydrogen from each other. In order to conveniently explore the mode specificity of the title reaction, the reaction HO2 + HO2 → H2O2 + O2 was divided into two channels. One is HOO' (v1, v2, v3) + HOO (GS) → OO' + H2O2 (R1a) and the other is HOO' (v1, v2, v3) + HOO (GS) → HOO'H + O2 (R1b)"", ""until all relevant dynamical results were converged and key properties, including geometries, frequencies, and energies of the stationary points, were well reproduced, compared to the direct UM06-2X/AVTZ calculations. In addition, some points were selected by the grid approach, which may sample configurations of high energy. These points are necessary for future quantum dynamical calculations, although these points may be not relevant by QCT.The next step is building a correction PES to correct the UM06-2X/AVTZ dataset. Specifically, the UM06-2X/AVTZ dataset was partitioned into two parts. One small subset was the training dataset, whose energies were re-calculated at the level of UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ. Then the differences between UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ and M06-2X/AVTZ energies for this small subset were used to train the correction PES ΔVHL-LL. This correction PES can be used to predict the energy differences of the remaining points of the UM06-2X/AVTZ dataset for the low-level PES.Namely, their energies were not calculated by the direct and expensive UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ calculations, but were corrected according to the following equation:HL LL HL LL E E E ， - = + \uf044(3)where ELL is the DFT energy, ΔEHL-LL is the correction part predicted by ΔVHL-LL, and ΔEHL is the final energy of the high-level accuracy.

417,"Grey hydrogenGrey hydrogen is produced by dehydrogenation of fossil fuels. There are two main grey hydrogen production processes:1. Reforming: hydrogen is produced by reacting a fossil fuel with steam, thereby releasing hydrogen as well as carbon monoxide, a mixture commonly referred to as 'syngas':CmHn + mH2O -> mCO + (m+n/2)H2(1)2. Partial oxidation: in this process, a fossil fuel is combusted with a sub-stoichiometric amount of oxygen, leading to the production of syngas:CmHn + m/2O2 -> mCO + n/2H2 (2)Steam methane reforming (SMR) is the leading process to produce grey hydrogen. In 2021, the global hydrogen demand reached a peak of 94 Mt. Currently, about 48% of the hydrogen produced worldwide (~45 Mt in 2021) comes from SMR. This process consists of dehydrogenating methane (commonly from a natural gas stream) to produce a hydrogen-rich mixture, and it is the cheapest at the industrial scale. However, its environmental impact is very high: every kg of H2 produced in this way generates around 8 kg of CO2, indirectly. Oil and coal gasification are still heavily used, accounting for the 30% (~28 Mt) and 18% (~17 Mt) of the world's hydrogen production in 2021, respectively. Typically, grey hydrogen production processes include additional steps (e.g., water-gas shift and acid gas removal) to maximize the hydrogen yield and separate the carbon oxides from the hydrogen stream.Among the traditional methods of producing grey hydrogen (reforming and partial oxidation), autothermal reforming (ATR) is used in less proportion. ATR which consists of the reforming of light alkanes (typically",Causal,Why is steam methane reforming the leading process for producing grey hydrogen despite its high environmental impact?,"Steam methane reforming is the leading process to produce grey hydrogen because it is the cheapest at the industrial scale.

The reasons behind the growing importance of H2 for our modern economy are: 1) decarbonization of energy production, in particular electricity, 2) sustainable alternative to fossil energy carriers (in particular natural gas), and 3) the lack of cost-effective energy storage of intermittent renewable energy (mostly produced in the form of electricity).There are three main families of hydrogen production technologies that are categorized by their 'carbonintensity' i.e., the amount of CO2 and CO2-equivalents emitted during production of hydrogen. These are described in the following sub-sections in descending order of carbon-intensity."", 'production of hydrogen could eliminate the need to use purified water, which can be expensive and energy-intensive to produce. Moreover, in the current scenario of water scarcity worldwide, purified water is a critical commodity: about one-in-four people (~2 billions) do not currently have access to clean, potable water. Unfortunately, this situation might worsen in the near future, due to the global warming and related climate change. Therefore, direct seawater splitting has the potential to be less reliant on centralized production facilities, making it a cheap, sustainable, and readily available option for de-centralized green hydrogen production. Cheap and Earth-abundant oxide-based semiconducting light absorbers could be pivotal for this technology: the main advantage of direct PC/PEC seawater splitting is that it does not require external sources of electricity to sustain the electrolysis, as schematically reported in Figure for a single junction device.Instead, the process is powered directly by sunlight, which is free, abundant (1.0 kW•m -2 at AM1.5), and renewable. In addition, due to the high concentration of NaCl in seawater (~0.5 mol•L -1 ) , this process could provide chlorine gas as a side (anodic) product, a commodity used to disinfect water, for the sanitation of sewage and industrial waste, and for production of derived chemicals and polymers. This side production could add a significant contribution to the value chain of hydrogen.The aforementioned green hydrogen production methods face the common challenge of high energy costs required to split water. According to thermodynamics, the energy input required for this reaction is equivalent to an applied voltage of 1.23 V. However, in practice, a voltage of more than 1.7 V must be applied to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),', ""Hydrogen in industryInterestingly, according to IEA, industry is the second-largest global source of CO2 emissions (related to the energy sector, after the combustion of fossil fuels), exceeding 8.4 Gt in 2020. In particular, three heavy industries, i.e. chemicals (production of primary chemicals i.e., ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, ammonia, and methanol), steel, and cement, account for nearly 60% of all energy consumption and about 72% of all the industrial CO2 emissions. Electrifying industry has been a viable option for years, but it has two challenges. Firstly, the cost of electricity per unit energy (MWh) is higher than fossil fuels, making it less appealing for businesses. Secondly, industrialized countries such as Germany, Poland, the US, and the Netherlands produce electricity with high carbon intensity (>300 g CO2/kWh) , making electrification ineffective in reducing industry's carbon footprint.In densely populated countries like the Netherlands, the electricity grid is near its maximum transport capacity, causing congestion problems. Large off-takers and electricity producers joining the network without a planned expansion worsen the situation. Hence, hydrogen is seen as a potential substitute for electrification. In industry, there are two primary methods for utilizing hydrogen. The first is to generate heat, primarily high-temperature heat. The second is to use it as a chemical reagent in processes such as the Haber-Bosch process for obtaining ammonia.If heat is the main input needed by a particular industry, then in principle hydrogen can directly substitute fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal. However, current developments have pointed to potential challenges about the combustion of hydrogen:• Handling hydrogen safely"", 'Blue hydrogenThe production process of blue hydrogen is similar to that of grey hydrogen; the main difference is that blue hydrogen includes the Capture and either Storage or Utilization of Carbon (CCUS). The capture of carbon consists of the separation of CO2 from a mixture (e.g., a flue gas from a combustion process or a CO2-rich natural gas stream) via physical or chemical means. The separation of carbon from the fuel is typically done using one of three methods:• Pre-combustionthe carbon is separated from the fuel before being combusted, as in analogy to the SMR process • Post-combustionthe carbon is separated after the fuel has been used to generate energy • Oxyfuel combustionthis technology is similar to post-combustion, but oxygen is used instead of air to combust the carbon-rich fuel, leading to a more complete combustion that releases less CO and has an inherently higher efficiency.Although there are different processes to separate the resulting CO2, most used carbon capture processes rely on post-combustion technologies. Table showcases how post-combustion carbon capture is performed, as well as the advantages and challenges of each technology. Table . Overview of the CO2 separation technologies. CO2 separation method', 'pointed to potential challenges about the combustion of hydrogen:• Handling hydrogen safely requires additional attention compared to gaseous fossil fuels such as natural gas. It is necessary to ensure that the safety standards for handling hydrogen are at least as high as those for natural gas. • Since the flame temperature of hydrogen (2180-2210 o C) is higher than that of natural gas (1930-1960 o C) , there is a growing concern that burning hydrogen can lead to an increase in (mainly thermal) NOx emissions as a result of the increased flame temperature. In this case, current developments in combustion technology and burner design are underway to solve this problem.As mentioned before, hydrogen can also be used as feedstock i.e., as a chemical reagent to take part in the Haber-Bosch process to produce ammonia:3H2 + N2 -> 2NH3 (4)Using hydrogen to produce ammonia is a well-established process. However, it has a disadvantagehydrogen can also be obtained from natural gas through steam methane reforming (SMR). As a result, substituting hydrogen in ammonia plants is primarily a cost optimization challenge.Hydrogen can be feedstock within the production of steel, namely the direct reduction of iron: 3Fe2O3 + 9H2 -> 6Fe + 9H2O (5)  InJa[a steel production, the challenge is exacerbated by the existing flexibility in the current steel manufacturing processes: iron can be reduced not only with hydrogen but also with carbon monoxide, involving other types of possibly more polluting fuels such as coke-oven gas, refinery bottoms, coal, and pet coke, which can be used in the process. Eventually, the introduction of hydrogen to the industry will largely depend on its price, which will be influenced by many parameters, among them the costs of its transportation and production.']","['Energy', 'Renewable energy sources']",1638,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.8800141087036242,2.220446049250313e-16,['why']

Using impedance spectroscopy measurements, we demonstrate excellent sensitivity towards the so called ""forever chemicals"" in water down to femtomolar concentrations.', 'Figure 4 .4Figure 4. Ultrasensitive detection of PFAS using a 2D MOF-based sensor. a) Illustration of MOF-based sensor.

The Bode plots were obtained from a representative device at very low PFOA concentrations, and calibration curve was obtained from 10 different representative sensors. Cu-HHTP films showed to detect PFOA at concentrations as low as 5 fM in PBS. An R 2 value of 0.968 could be achieved from 10 different devices. f) Bode plots recorded from the MOF channel when different amounts of PFOS are added into PBS solution.', ""observed oxidation of the MOF film also showed to be non-destructive for the MOF structure. Despite the coloration change most likely due to the overall change in charge along the active site, the structure of the MOF remained intact after dipping in PFAS and washing.The elemental composition of the MOF film was found to remain unchanged as evidenced from the post-sensing XPS spectra (Fig. ). This structural stability towards the oxidative adsorption of PFAS in Cu-HHTP as well as the efficient release of sensed PFA molecules was rationalized by the fact that the key interactions between the MOF and the analyte are due to surface electrostatics that are electronically detectable yet reversible especially at low PFA concentrations. This behavior is enabled by the thin film platform we utilize as opposed to previously studied powders (oftentimes using morphological binders) that rely on the binding and trapping of the analyte. In our film-based devices, we expect a high density of the metal active sites on the surface, which would translate to a highly sensitive bind-and-release mechanism even at low analyte concentrations. We then tested the sensitivity of our MOF films towards PFAS using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a means to monitor the change in channel conductance, where spurious effects, such as resistance to current injection, don't affect sensitivity. The simple device architecture of our studied MOF-based sensor is shown in Figure a. We employ a 2-terminal device layout which has been previously shown to be effective for recording EIS changes in resistance-dominated systems. More specifically, we record the changes in the"", 'change even after 10 cycles, likely due to abundant binding sites at the film interface. This excellent sensitivity towards PFAS in MOF-based devices contrasted with a control device where a bare channel used and immersed in contaminated water similarly to the MOF-based sensor. The bare channel shows an increase in resistance when PFOA was introduced in PBS (Fig. ) as expected after introducing non-conductive analytes. Given the sensitivity of impedance spectroscopy towards electrolyte compositional changes, the observed decrease in our MOF film resistance while the electrolyte resistance increases proves that the material is indeed sensing the analyte. Such working mechanism using Cu-HHTP allows us to efficiently detect oxidative agents (in this case PFAS) especially in water using a robust and affordable setup.The MOF-based sensors we demonstrate are easy to fabricate, scalable, and offer readouts in minutes as opposed to other techniques such as mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, time-of-flight mass spectrometry) which involve long sample preparation and data acquisition times. In fact, our sensors show to be extremely sensitive (with a detection limit as low as 0.002 ng/L) towards the two most common PFAS (PFOA and PFOS) proving to detect these compounds well below their health advisory levels (HALs) recommended by the US environmental protection agency (EPA) and the food and drug administration (FDA). In drinking water, the HALs for these two acids have been set to as low as 10 ng/L. The MOF-based sensor could detect both PFOA and PFOS at concentrations nearly 4 orders of magnitude below these suggested levels (Fig. ), and more than 2 orders of magnitude better than the best reported sensitivity levels by sensors', 'target=""#b19"">[20] This adsorptivity was also utilized by Cheng et al. to demonstrate ultrasensitive detection of PFOS using a mesoporous chromiumbased MOF (Cr-MIL-101). In that case, a MOF powder was sandwiched between two interdigitated electrodes to form a microchannel through which contaminated water was flowed.Changes in the channel resistance could be monitored to sense the presence of PFAS using impedance spectroscopy. Such devices could detect as low as 0.5 ng/L of PFOS in PBS. Despite the complicated device assembly and limited understanding on the sensing mechanism, these recent efforts show that MOFs can be used for efficient detection and capture of PFAS.MOF-based sensors however still face major challenges mostly related to poor processability. Since these frameworks are synthesized as crystalline powders, it remains challenging to incorporate them into functional devices, which often require robust coating of active materials. In most reported device fabrication protocols, binders and additives are used to deposit MOF and immobilize particles, which complicates the fundamental understanding of the relationship between intrinsic porosity and performance as intrinsic materials performance may be masked by extrinsic defects such as intergranular boundaries.2D conductive MOFs (2D c-MOFs) have recently emerged as a type of MOF that can potentially uncover the understanding of guest-host interactions by exposing more active sites and minimizing large grain boundaries. Such MOFs are also advantageous as they have shown to be processible into thin films. <ref type=""bibr""']","['Metal organic frameworks', 'Sensing and detection']",3032,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.912590736622288,0.3098834802289734,['why']

Moderate activities and good enantiomeric ratios were observed with SCP_Q111BpyAla giving the highest e.r. of 14:86 in favour of the S enantiomer. In general, lower enantioselectivities were observed for the cysteine-modified catalysts and this is attributed to increased flexibility around the active site due to the additional S-CH2 linker. Changing from genetic incorporation of BpyAla at Q111 to bioconjugation of bipyridine through a cysteine, resulted in an unexpected change in the major isomer observed from S to R, albeit with a reduction in enantiomeric excess. This result is intriguing as a major challenge in enzyme catalysis is accessing the opposite product enantiomer. Crystallographic and computational studies confirm that changes in the structure of the active site led to the stabilisation of indole 3 on different sides of the bound enone 4, with the enantiomeric ratios observed correlating with the difference in the calculated transition state energies for the proR and proS SCP_Q111BpyAla and SCP_Q111CBpy Cu catalyst models. Based on these findings, future work should prioritize determining the most suitable modification method for the desired application of the ArM before proceeding with reaction screening and optimization, as subtle differences in protein structure can substantially change the stabilised transition state.The crystal structure obtained of SCP-Q111BpyAla_Cu is a rare example of a protein structure containing an unnatural amino acid.

525,"difference spectra (EADS) -the latter resulting from a global fit of the data using a sequential kinetic scheme.At first, observation of the datasets collected at three different excitation wavelengths suggests that the main features of the observed dynamics are similar for all three excitation wavelengths.However, significant differences are present in the details of decay kinetics and the intensity ratios of different bands. Let us first classify the different spectral regions by assigning them with names to aid the discussion of the dynamics in detail. Starting from the high energy side (Figure ), the difference spectra consist of an induced absorption (IA) band peaking around 330 nm (hereafter referred to as IA-330), and a ground state bleach (GSB) corresponding to the strong 355 nm absorption seen in the steady-state spectrum (denoted GSB-355). Further to the red, IA is again observed as a broad band stretching up to ca. 450 nm (IA-400), from where it is again replaced by a GSB signal exhibiting a clear vibronic-like structure -similar to the series of maxima observed in the red part of the absorption spectrum (GSB-550). A detailed summary of the fs-ns transient absorption dynamics is presented in the form of EADS in Figure , E and F. The presented spectra are a result of fitting the data to a sequential kinetic model (A  B  C …). The error on the time constants in the ps range is of the order of 25%, and the last constant in the ns range cannot be estimated precisely due to the limited experimental time window.

The quality of the fit can be assessed from the traces depicted in Figure , and the similar data for other excitation",Explanatory,What is the lifetime of the initial component that was strongly contaminated by coherent-coupling artifacts?,approximately 150 femtoseconds,Easy,"['The spectrum of an initial component (lifetime of ca. 150 fs) was strongly contaminated by coherent-coupling artifacts, and was therefore omitted from the presentation.']","[[1546, 1714]]","['in Figure , and the similar data for other excitation wavelengths in supporting Information figures S3 & S4. We first note that the evolution time constants produced by the fitting are quite similar for all three datasets, allowing us to directly compare the spectra of different components between the three excitation wavelengths.In the IA-300 region, the induced absorption band exhibits a 0.5-ps growth, and then decays almost to zero over the next 1.1 ps evolution step (see transition from black to red in Figure ). This is in contrast with all the other spectral regions (GSB-355, IA-400, GSB-550 and IA-GSB-600),where the absorption difference decays twofold in 0.5 ps, but in the subsequent 1.1 ps remains approximately constant, albeit with small spectral shifts. These shifts are best noticeable in the GSB-355 region, where the GSB maximum first shifts to the red, and then back to the blue. The spectral evolution on ca. 10-ps timescale produces the most dramatic spectral change (green-to-blue in Figure ). IA-330 reappears (slightly red-shifted compared to the 1.1-ps spectrum), while GSB-355 shifts noticeably to the red and develops a negative tail, replacing the initially-observed positive IA-400 with negative GSB (the latter is clearly discerned in the blue EADS at wavelengths up to 400 nm). This is accompanied by the disappearance of IA in the IA-GSB-600 spectral region, and the emergence of a negative GSB signal. Within ca. 50-60 ps, the blue EADS is replaced by cyan EADS, where -once again -most of IA-330 is lost, the negative peak of GSB-355 is again shifted to the blue, and IA-400 reappears, reminiscent of the signal observed at the 10 ps evolutionary step.

In the GSB-550 region, the vibronic bands shift to the red, and the red GSB tail in the IA-GSB-600 range becomes more pronounced. The last step in spectral evolution is mostly the loss of signal amplitude. However, it also shifts the GSB-355 band to the red (again), loses almost all of the IA signal in the IA-400 region, and further red-shifts the GSB-550 vibronic-like bands and the red GSB tail in IA-GSB-600. This plethora of growths and decays, and shifts in both directions, results in the complicated spectro- showing a negative region around 400 nm that can be attributed GSB of the strong absorption peak at 355 nm. In the 440-580 nm region, there is ESA with valleys at 480 and 520 nm, which may correspond to the 0-2 and 0-1 vibronic peaks of the S0\uf0aeS2 electronic transitions, respectively. In monomeric lycopene, the T1\uf0aeTn transition presents an ESA maximum circa 520 nm and decays over 12 \uf06ds . The results for the lycopene aggregates suggest that there are at least two different triplet species formed. The species associated to the first EADS has been identified as a triplet in tomato chromoplasts.

This would allow us to propose more sophisticated models than the current linear scheme. The selective purification of each species of lycopene aggregate would clearly be ideal, but this may well turn out to be extremely complex given the number of different aggregate types formed here and reported in the literature. An alternative would be to use time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy, which should be sensitive enough to separate and distinguish the different excited states involved.

One of the most prominent and versatile methods is the metal-catalyzed coupling of thiols with aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides, also referred to as Migita-coupling. Until recently aryl bromides and iodides were typically employed as electrophiles rather than the less reactive but abundant aryl chlorides. In comparison to aryl (pseudo)halides, alkenyl electrophiles have been much less systematically explored. One of the disadvantages of halides is the synthesis of not commercially available substrates, which may require multiple steps , forcing reaction conditions 10 restricting the functional group tolerance, as well as toxic chemicals (e.g. CCl4, 11 PCl5 12 ).

Phenols and ketones are both abundant, available as well as low-cost, and thus attractive building blocks, especially for more complex pharmaceutically active compounds.

Regarding alkenyl electrophiles, only few reports were dedicated to the palladium catalyzed C-S coupling of tosylates 8f and triflates, 8e while nickel catalysed couplings are even more underrepresented. The most recent example is the electrochemically promoted coupling of alkenyl triflates with thiols employing air-sensitive Ni(cod)2 (15 mol%) reported by Pan and co-workers (Scheme 1b). 8j They demonstrated an extensive substrate scope for aryl thiols, but only a limited scope for alkyl thiols(3 examples) providing moderate yields.

We showed in our previous work on the sulfenylation of aryl chlorides that the reaction most likely proceeds through a Ni(0)/Ni(II) mechanism and acetate-assisted deprotonation of thiols, which is also plausible for the reaction of triflates (Scheme 5). The activation of the precatalyst, which is structurally related to the product of the oxidative addition, occurs via the same steps as the catalytic reaction (coordination of thiol, deprotonation and reductive elimination of the thioether). Interestingly, the reaction progress comparison of different electrophiles showed that aryl triflates not only have the highest reaction rate, but also the shortest induction period < 5 minutes (Scheme 6). It indicates a fast catalyst activation, which might be explained by a substrate assisted reductive elimination. This underlines the superiority of aryl triflates as electrophiles in this reaction. The representative of alkenyl triflates was converted with lower efficiency, possibly due to higher sensitivity of the compound.']","['Catalysis', 'Homogeneous catalysis']",1572,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9914900947207258,4.440892098500625e-16,['which']

The regions circled in correspond to carbonyl carbon atoms, which are expected to be electron deficient and therefore require small A and B Lennard-Jones coefficients. Blue and dashed black lines represent lines of best fit and y = x respectively. The use of system-specific non-bonded parameters for biomolecular force fields allows for long-ranged polarization effects to be included, which is expected to improve the accuracy of the force field, particularly for measurements such as protein-ligand binding affinity that are sensitive to the electrostatic potential at the protein surface. A comparison of the QUBE and OPLS non-bonded parameters for ubiquitin is shown in Figure . Figures for the other proteins tested follow similar trends. As we have described, QUBE non-bonded parameters are derived directly from the QM partitioned electron density, and so, each atom has a unique charge and set of Lennard-Jones coefficients which depend on its environment. In contrast, the OPLS parameters are read from a library of atom types. The QUBE and OPLS charges correlate well with no clear outliers. As has previously been observed, the QUBE Lennard-Jones parameters show a far greater level of variation than OPLS (and most other force fields).One assumption employed in the use of system-specific charges for proteins (and small molecules) is that the derived parameter set is not too dependent on the molecular conformation.

The standard deviation of the charge distribution across the ensemble is just 0.02 e, supporting previous observations that the underlying DDEC atoms-in-molecule charges are relatively independent of conformation. It is important to test whether these system-specific force field parameters translate into more accurate protein interactions and dynamics. In this regard, although the conformational preferences of the peptides tested in the previous section are promising, it is not known whether the torsional parameters will continue to be appropriate for use with proteins. As the non-bonded parameters vary with the system studied, the transferability of torsional parameters cannot be readily assumed. To assess this we begin by studying MD simulations of the proteins ubiquitin and GB3.The J coupling errors for ubiquitin and GB3 are summarized in Table . With an overall RMSE of 1.54 Hz, the error using the QUBE force field for ubiquitin is higher than that of OPLS-AA/M, which has an RMSE of 1.12 Hz, but lower than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L with errors of 1.84 Hz and 1.70 Hz respectively. 1 GB3 follows the same trend with an RMSE of 1.10 Hz for the QUBE force field, compared to the error for OPLS-AA/M of 0.90 Hz, whilst OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L both have an error of 1.46 Hz. 1 The J coupling results suggest that whilst the transfer of torsional parameters from dipeptides to proteins may cause some issues, the QUBE force field remains more accurate than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L. This is promising when we consider that OPLS has been in development for many years with multiple iterations and parameter adjustments performed.The 3 J(H α , H β ) coupling term is the main contributor to the J coupling', 'Development and Validation of the QUBE Protein Force Field Molecular mechanics force field parameters for macromolecules, such as proteins, are traditionally fit to reproduce experimental properties of small molecules, and thus they neglect system-specific polarization. In this paper, we introduce a complete protein force field that is designed to be compatible with the QUantum mechanical BEspoke (QUBE) force field by deriving non-bonded parameters directly from the electron density of the specific protein under study. The main backbone and sidechain protein torsional parameters are re-derived in this work by fitting to quantum mechanical dihedral scans for compatibility with QUBE non-bonded parameters. Software is provided for the preparation of QUBE input files. The accuracy of the new force field, and the derived torsional parameters, are tested by comparing the conformational preferences of a range of peptides and proteins with experimental measurements. Accurate backbone and sidechain conformations are obtained in molecular dynamics simulations of dipeptides, with NMR J coupling errors comparable to the widely-used OPLS force field. In simulations of five folded proteins, the secondary structure is generally retained and the NMR J coupling errors are similar to standard transferable force fields, although some loss of the experimental structure is observed in certain regions of the proteins. With several avenues for further development, the use of system-specific nonbonded force field parameters is a promising approach for next-generation simulations of biological molecules.', 'Molecular Dynamics SimulationsFigure shows the steps required to set up a QUBE protein force field for a MD simulation. As in Section 2.1, the ONETEP linear-scaling DFT software is used to compute the ground state electron density of the five proteins, and assign the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters from the partitioned atomic electron densities. Consistent with the QUBE small molecule approach, every atom in the protein is assigned bespoke non-bonded parameters derived from the quantum mechanical electron density. To model polarization effects in the condensed phase, the electron density is computed first in vacuum, then using an implicit solvent model with a dielectric constant of 80. The iPol approach used in AMBER ff15ipq is then employed, with all non-bonded parameters set halfway between their vacuum and condensed phase values. The purpose of this approach, as well as overcoming issues associated with closing of the electronic band gap in large system sizes, is to account for electrostatics and induction in the condensed phase in an effective manner using a fixed point charge force field. Typical computational requirements for a QM calculation on a small protein (≈ 1000 atoms) are approximately 2000 cpuhrs. In order to provide a consistent and computationally efficient approach to assigning the non-bonded parameters, we recommend minimizing the experimental structure using a standard transferable force field in explicit water prior to the DFT calculation. In this study, we used the OPLS-AA/M force field for the initial minimization. Following non-bonded parameter assignment, bond, angle and torsion parameters were assigned as described in Section 2 based', 'emerges is that this first generation quantum mechanical bespoke force field is an improvement over legacy OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L force fields, but is out-performed by the most recent OPLS-AA/M force field for simulated dynamics of folded proteins in their native state. While we have previously shown that DDEC charges are not too dependent on small conformation changes, 28 further investigation is needed to establish the utility of QUBE for protein folding simulations.Hence, although we have outlined our roadmap to future improvements, a natural question is: where can the QUBE protein force field be used now (especially given the higher cost of parameterization compared to transferable force fields)? Importantly, it has been shown previously that the use of system-specific force field charges leads to improvements in binding energetics of small molecules, and reproduction of the QM electrostatic potential for both small molecules 27 and proteins. Therefore, although simulated protein backbone dynamics is an important test, we envisage the QUBE small molecule and protein force field being particularly important for the study of intermolecular interactions in the condensed phase.Indeed, QUBE was originally developed to provide, by construction, a compatible protein and small molecule force field for computer-aided drug design, where an accurate surface electrostatic potential of the protein is crucial. In this regard, the absolute binding free energies between the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme and six benzene analogs have been recently computed using QUBE with a mean unsigned error of 0.85 kcal/mol, which compares very favorably with OPLS-AA/M (1.26 kcal/mol). Although further work is required to establish this accuracy across a significantly wider range of protein-ligand complexes, the promise of these initial biomolecular simulation', 'that facilitates the derivation of small organic molecule force field parameters, and also allows the user to derive the positions of off-site charges to model anisotropic electron density and to fit dihedral parameters to QM torsion scans. QUBE force fields have been derived for 109 small organic molecules, and yield mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm 3 , 0.79 kcal/mol and 1.17 kcal/mol in computed liquid density, heat of vaporization and free energy of hydration. These results are competitive with standard transferable force fields, which have been extensively fit to properties such as these.To achieve our goal of employing the QUBE force field in computer-aided drug design applications, we require a compatible protein force field. Since the non-bonded parametrization strategy employed in QUBE is very different to that used in the standard biomolecular force fields (e.g. AMBER, OPLS, CHARMM), there is no reason to believe that they are compatible. However, by implementing the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameter derivation methods in the ONETEP linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) software, we have shown that it is feasible to derive these charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for entire proteins. In this way, the number of fitting parameters is substantially reduced, and we have a consistent parametrization approach that can be applied to both small and large molecules, including entire biomolecular assemblies. Since, in this approach, all non-bonded parameters are derived from a single QM calculation, both the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters naturally include the native state polarization effects of the environment.

897,"Discussion and ConclusionThe assumption that biomolecular force fields must be parametrized against the experimental properties of small molecules has persisted since MM simulations began and remains in all force fields under widespread use. In this work, we look to challenge this assumption by deriving system-specific non-bonded parameters, from linear-scaling QM simulations, for consistency with the QUBE small molecule force field. These non-bonded terms were used here alongside libraries of (non-bespoke) bond and angle parameters, derived using the modified Seminario method, and newly reparametrized torsional terms.We have shown here that using system-specific non-bonded force field parameters can result in accurate conformational preferences for short peptides. Rotamer populations and simulated J couplings for the dipeptide molecules are in good agreement with experimental data and compare favorably with the latest OPLS force field. For longer peptide molecules, the problems associated with fitting torsional parameters to a system-specific force field became more apparent. Using regularization in the fitting process was shown to overcome these issues and resulted in a J coupling error of just 0.90 ± 0.03 for the alanine pentapeptide. Further work investigating disordered peptides will ascertain how general this fix is.The accuracy of the peptide simulations supports the use of our non-bonded and modified Seminario bonded parametrization strategies.

This work focuses on the remaining component of the force field, namely the re-fitting of key torsional parameters that describe the backbone and sidechain dynamics of an amino acid. The methods and validation tests broadly follow the approaches employed in the development of OPLS-AA/M, the latest OPLS force field. Torsional parameters are fit by minimizing the differences between multiple QM and MM potential energy scans of dipeptide backbone and sidechain dihedral angles.

This benchmark testset is similar to those used in the development of protein force fields such as AMBER ff15ipq, AMOEBA, CHARMM36 and OPLS-AA/M.

This is in contrast to the performance of RESP charges, which have been shown to be significantly more conformation-dependent for an ensemble of polypeptide structures. Additional simulations demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of deriving bespoke parameters for a protein-ligand complex. The computed relative binding free energy of indole and benzofuran to the lysozyme protein using the environment-specific force fields (-0.4 kcal/mol) was in excellent agreement with experiment (-0.6 kcal/mol), and was substantially more accurate than standard force fields (-2.4 kcal/mol). However, the force field was in need of further development as the bespoke non-bonded terms were used in combination with standard OPLS-AA bonded parameters.The use of these parameters potentially limits the accuracy of the force field due to interdependency between the bonded terms, particularly the torsional parameters, and the non-bonded components of the force field. This issue is the subject of the current paper.In standard transferable force fields, the torsional component is typically parameterized using QM dihedral energy scans, with the difference between analogous MM and QM energy scans minimized by fitting the torsional parameters. Reparameterization of the torsional terms has been shown to be a crucial step in improving the accuracy of force fields and this has recently been demonstrated for AMBER ff15ipq, CHARMM36 and OPLS-AA/M.

In simulations of five folded proteins, the secondary structure is generally retained and the NMR J coupling errors are similar to standard transferable force fields, although some loss of the experimental structure is observed in certain regions of the proteins. With several avenues for further development, the use of system-specific nonbonded force field parameters is a promising approach for next-generation simulations of biological molecules.', 'Seminario method for a range of molecules. In particular, QM vibrational frequencies for a set of dipeptides were reproduced with an accuracy of 40 cm -1 , which compares favorably with the OPLS force field (47 cm -1 ) and the original Seminario method (104 cm -1 ). Since the derived bond and angle parameters do not depend on the choice of non-bonded and torsion parameters, the derived parameters are suitable for use in the QUBE protein force field. Since large-scale polarization effects are expected to be significantly less important for bond and angle parameters than for charges, we use the library of bonded parameters provided previously (and the same atom types as those used for OPLS-AA/M 1 ).Whilst preparing the protein simulations, it was found that our library was missing parameters for the disulfide bridge between pairs of cysteine residues. These bond and angle parameters were therefore derived using the QM Hessian matrix of dimethyl disulfide and are supplied in Section S2.3 of the Supporting Information. With new bond, angle and non-bonded parameters derived, all that remains to complete the QUBE protein force field is to obtain the torsional parameters. Unfortunately, it is infeasible to derive torsional parameters from QM simulations that are specific to each protein.']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Unclassified']",390,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.7890196708887406,2.3020169319411075,['what']
1227,"A Automatic Generation of Internal CoordinatesOur approach for finding internal coordinates, illustrated in figure , begins by constructing a molecular graph from the initial Cartesian geometry. This is accomplished by checking all pairs of atoms, and adding a bond ifx j -x i < σ r cov i + r cov j ,(35)where x i and x j are the Cartesian position of atoms i and j, σ is a scalar parameter which in Sella defaults to 1.25, and r cov i and r cov j are the covalent radii of atoms i and j. After all pairs of atoms have been checked, a flood fill algorithm is used to count the number of disconnected fragments in the molecular graph. This algorithm works by walking along the graph and noting which atoms belong to the same fragment, then counting the number of distinct fragments. If only a single fragment is found, the algorithm exits; otherwise, σ is increased by 5 % and the above procedure is repeated with the additional rule that only pairs of atoms in different molecular fragments are checked for connectivity. This additional rule helps ensure that geometries with large separation between clusters of atoms do not become densely connected. This procedure For systems composed of independent molecules, it may not be chemically meaningful to consider internal coordinates that connect two molecules together. However, the previously described procedure will necessarily add bonds, angles, and dihedrals that span across molecules. This can have a negative impact on performance, as the optimizer will limit the extent to which these chemically irrelevant coordinates can change at each step. To resolve this problem, we also implement as an alternative the translational and rotation internal coordinates (TRIC) method of Wang and Song.

When using the TRIC method, our algorithm will stop adding bonds between atoms after a single iteration of the procedure described above. Each disconnected fragment of the molecular graph is then augmented with translational coordinates of the fragment barycenter and rotational coordinates following the TRIC procedure.', 'internal coordinate systems increase the complexity of the optimization problem, as the coordinate system is by construction of a higher dimensionality than the space of all possible molecular configurations. We have described these problems and the methods we developed and implemented in Sella to ameliorate them in a previous work. Our algorithm constructs a complete set of internal coordinates by mapping all possible pairs, triplets, and quadruplets of sequentially-bonded atoms from a molecular graph to bond distance, bending angle, and dihedral angle coordinates, respectively. This procedure is described in detail in appendix A.One problem that is frequently encountered when constructing internal coordinate systems is bending angles may become nearly or completely linear. This is a problem because linear bending angles do not have a well-defined Cartesian derivative, and dihedral angle coordinates which contain a linear angle are undefined. This problem is typically solved by manually replacing the pathological angle with one or more new coordinates, usually an improper dihedral or in-and out-of-plane bending angles. However, if the central atom of the pathological angle is only bonded to two other atoms, then it is not possible to define a chemically meaningful improper dihedral to replace the angle. In that case, it is necessary to define a new, so-called ""dummy"" atom, which is used to help define the improper dihedral. For this scenario, we have developed an algorithm for automatically adding dummy atoms to a molecule, potentially even mid-optimization. This is a key aspect of our method, as without automatic reconstruction of internal coordinates, some molecular saddle point optimizations will fail due to the coordinate system becoming ill-defined. To the best of our knowledge, no other optimizer automatically reconstructs the internal', 'and the related algorithms are not efficient for saddle point searches on the potential energy landscapes of sparsely connected atomic systems, such as molecules, because of the strong coupling between atomic degrees of freedom. Molecular optimization (both for minima and saddle points) is generally performed in a basis of internal coordinates, which typically comprise bond stretch distances, bending angles, and dihedral angles, as internal coordinates are significantly less energetically correlated than Cartesian coordinates. These chemically relevant features provide a more effective coordinate system for optimization at the cost of additional algorithmic complexity. We have recently developed a new method for realizing displacements in a basis of redundant internal coordinates which dramatically reduces the number of steps required to reach convergence on a minimization benchmark. In this work, we extend this algorithm to optimization of saddle point geometries.Our optimization algorithm is designed to be used in automated frameworks without the need for manual intervention. However, the complexity of optimization in a basis of internal coordinates frequently frustrates attempts at automation. For example, when a bending angle of a molecule becomes linear or nearly linear during the course of optimization, displacement of the bending angle coordinate becomes ill-defined. To solve this problem, it is necessary to redefine the internal coordinate system to replace the linear bending angle with a different coordinate. Occasionally, this may require the addition of fictional ""dummy atoms"" that act as scaffolding off of which the replacement coordinate can be defined. The process of adding dummy atoms and dealing with the', ""Figure 8 :8Figure 8: An illustration of our algorithm for identifying internal coordinates.

The success of this projection approach depends entirely on the accuracy of the approximate Hessian, and so the performance observed in this test system indicates that the initial iterative Hessian diagonalization and TS-BFGS Hessian updates are highly effective."", 'Handling linear angles using dummy atomsAn internal coordinate system describes the geometry of a molecule using the relative positions and orientations of atoms within the molecule, in contrast to the Cartesian coordinate system which describes the geometry using the absolute positions of each atom. The most common types of internal coordinates are the two-atom bond distances, three-atom bending angles, and four-atom dihedral angles. A sufficiently large set of these three types of internal coordinates can fully represent all internal degrees of freedom of a molecule. To facilitate automation, our algorithm is capable of automatically determining an appropriate set of internal coordinates. Notably, the algorithm handles systems with linear bending angles by replacing those coordinates with alternate coordinates, adding dummy atoms where necessary. Without this functionality, optimization algorithms in internal coordinates will often crash due to derivative discontinuities in bending angle degrees of freedom.There are many ways to construct an internal coordinate system for a molecule.Perhaps the simplest approach is the Z-matrix representation, which defines a minimal internal coordinate system. However, the Z-matrix representation necessarily omits chemically relevant features for non-trivial molecules, particularly molecules with rings.This has a deleterious effect on performance, as the excluded chemically relevant features may change drastically after even a small displacement in the Z-matrix coordinate space. For this reason, our algorithm uses a redundant internal coordinate system that includes all chemically relevant bond stretch, angle bend, and dihedral angle coordinates.Redundant internal coordinate systems increase the complexity of the optimization']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Theoretical methods']",2493,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9939913346437416,1.1102230246251563e-16,['why']
784,"target=""#fig_2"">4D). Generating sequence orthogonal tyrosinases could enable the facile creation of complex multi-domain proteins by coupling anionic and cationic tagged subunits sequentially. This could be done in a manner similar to peptide synthesis but using entire proteins as building blocks. The controlled production of multi-protein polymers could be an enabling technology for protein based materials, biomedical technologies, and enzyme engineering. Although the megaTYR mutants to date were not fully prevented from acting on cationic substrates, the range in selectivity between abTYR and D55R megaTYR proved a tantalizing target. To test this, the cysteine-containing Y200C sfGFP was modified with EEEEY and RRRRY C-terminal tags, which should be unreactive with abTYR, and D55R megaTYR, respectively (Figure , S4). After purification, the Y200C sfGFP-EEEEY (GFP-E4Y) was exposed to abTYR for 30 min in a variety of conditions. Notably, the mushroom tyrosinase was able to append GGGGY and RRRRY peptides to the GFP-E4Y without oxidizing the EEEEY tag. In addition, exposing the GFP-E4Y to abTYR resulted in no discernable oxidation by ESI-MS. This aligns with our previous peptide screens, and suggests that the EEEEY tag is not succeptible to abTYR activation (Figure ). Similarly, Y200C sfGFP-RRRRY (GFP-R4Y) was exposed to D55R megaTYR under similar conditions, with the EEEEY peptide used in place of the RRRRY peptide. Similarly to abTYR, D55R megaTYR was able to selectively oxidize the added peptides without modifying the tyrosine tag on the GFP-R4Y. Reaction selectivity was further confirmed when exposure of GFP-R4Y to D55R megaTYR alone did not result in any oxidation (Figure ). Together these data suggest that abTYR and D55R megaTYR can be used for CDSAT on proteins and peptides.To further validate reaction orthogonality we",Explanatory,What could generating sequence orthogonal tyrosinases enable the facile creation of by coupling anionic and cationic tagged subunits sequentially?,Complex multi-domain proteins,Easy,['Generating sequence orthogonal tyrosinases could enable the facile creation of complex multi-domain proteins by coupling anionic and cationic tagged subunits sequentially.'],"[[21, 192]]","['can be used for CDSAT on proteins and peptides.To further validate reaction orthogonality we next exposed the GFP-E4Y to a phenolbiotin in the presence of abTYR and showed selective oxidation of the small molecule to afford the GFP-E4Y-biotin conjugate (Figure ).

After purification using a 10 kDa MWCO spin concentrator, both the maleimide and phenol GFP-E4Y-biotin were combined with Y200C sfGFP and 12 U/L D55R megaTYR for 30 min and analyzed via ESI-TOF-MS. We observed over 70% conversion to the trimer composed of two GFP proteins and a biotin molecule, making this one of the first techniques capable of creating 3-component fusions without the need for solid support tethering or removable protective groups (Figure ). In addition, some higher order modifications appeared, arising from residual disulfide formation between unreacted thiols in the first step.

Thermal treatment at temperatures below 600 ⁰C followed by CO adsorption at room temperature develops a band at ~2237 cm -1 and exhibits a maximum at 2232 cm -1 when saturated (yellow trace, Fig. ). We recently demonstrated that the extra-framework aluminum (EFAL) species that form in zeolite after thermal/steaming treatment are alumina clusters formed during steaming with a high proportion of coordinatively unsaturated penta Al sites (due to their small size) : CO adsorption on these sites produces the presently observed band with a maximum at 2240-2232 cm - 1 .

Such a Lewis acid site has not been reported for any zeolite; this C-O stretching frequency of 2252 cm -1 is the highest known for any supported material.

This is the first reported observation of a +3 cation stabilized in a zeolite and the first confirmation of existence of aluminum triplets (as opposed to Al pairs) in that can stabilize such cations in siliceous zeolites. This site forms a thermally stable carbonyl O3Al-CO complex with the highest known frequency at 2252 cm -1 for a carbonyl complex on any solid material.

CO on this Lewis acid site desorbs under vacuum at 100 ⁰C. Re-admission of CO at room temperature restores the CO band on alumina clusters but does not affect the 2252 cm -1 band (Fig. ). Further, introduction of NO on this sample does not lead to displacement of CO (Fig. ), indicative of Al(III) sites which do not form stable NO complexes, but can coordinate CO.Upon introduction of water vapor in the IR cell at room temperature on the 650 ⁰C dehydrated samples, then we heated the sample under high vacuum at 450 ⁰C, no CO adsorption band was observed at 2252 cm -1 but CO signatures on EFAL (alumina clusters) were observed (Fig. ).We then heated the sample at 650 ⁰C in the IR cell, adsorbed CO at room temperature which led to the formation of the 2252 cm -1 band (Fig. ). This confirms that Al cation strongly coordinates water under ambient conditions or at slightly elevated temperatures as the zeolite is thermally dehydrated and that high temperatures are required to reversibly dehydrate this Al species. Dehydration results in bare +3 Al cation that has to be charge balanced by Al the framework triplet.We further exposed the 650 ⁰C activated H-FAU sample to D2 at 25, 50 and 100 ⁰C (Fig. ).This led to evolution of hydrides with characteristic Al-D stretches in the 1430-1370 cm -1 region (Fig. ) .

Complemented by direct access to Raman datasets, preprocessing protocols and performance metrics, this provides the foundation for AI model development and benchmarking.The codebase of RamanSPy is hosted at https://github.com/ barahona-research-group/RamanSPy with extended documentation (https://ramanspy.readthedocs.io), which includes tutorials and example applications, and details about the real-world research applications presented in this paper.', 'of the Python ecosystem, i.e., data can be loaded, preprocessed, and analysed in RamanSPy and then exported to conduct further modelling and analysis elsewhere (Fig. ). As an example application, we perform AI-based bacteria identification using Raman measurements from 30 bacterial and yeast isolates (Fig. ). After loading and exploring the spectra with RamanSPy, we interface the data with the lazypredict Python package and benchmark 28 different ML classification models (including logistic regression, support vector machines and decision trees) on the task of predicting the species from the spectrum. The models were trained on a high-SNR dataset (100 spectra per isolate) and tested on an unseen high-SNR testing set of the same size. Our benchmarking analysis in Fig. finds logistic regression as the best-performing model, achieving a classification accuracy of 79.63% on the species-level classification task (Fig. ), and 94.63% for antibiotic treatment classification (Fig. ).To further assist validation against previous results, RamanSPy provides access to a library of curated datasets, which can be integrated into analysis and benchmarking workflows.

These restrictions have also hampered the adoption of new AI technologies into the field . As a consequence, researchers increasingly resort to developing inhouse scripts for RS analysis in Python , further adding to methodological fragmentation and lack of standardisation .In response to these challenges, we have developed RamanSPy -a modular, open-source framework for integrated Raman Spectroscopy analytics in Python. RamanSPy is designed to systematise day-to-day workflows, enhance algorithmic development and validation, and accelerate the adoption of novel AI technologies into the RS field. Firstly, RamanSPy serves as a platform for general-purpose RS analytics supporting the RS data life cycle by providing a suite of ready-to-use modules for data loading, preprocessing, analysis and visualisation. By design, these functionalities are not tied to any specific technology or data type, thereby allowing integrative and transferable Fig. General Raman spectroscopy workflow and core features of RamanSPy . a, RamanSPy supports the Raman spectroscopic data analysis life cycle via a modular, loosely coupled architecture. RS data is parsed to a common data representation format, which is interfaced with preprocessing, analysis and visualisation tools within RamanSPy.

These modules are flexible and allow the incorporation of further techniques and in-house methods.

To do this, we simply wrap within RamanSPy the pre-trained neural network (trained on spectra from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, available at https://github.com/conor-horgan/DeepeR) as a custom denoising method.

VARIATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF QEOM-UCC/DAVIDSONThe qEOM-UCC/Davidson algorithm utilizes classical computers to diagonalize Hsub and orthogonalized residual vectors by the Gram-Schmidt procedure.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSIn this contribution, we presented the implementation of the Davidson algorithm and its variational variant within the quantum version of EOM-CC for computing electronically excited states. We tested the method, named qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson and qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson/Variational, on four systems: H 2 /6-31G, H 4 /STO-3G, LiH/STO-3G, and H 2 O/STO-3G(FC) showing good agreements with the energies obtained from EOM-VQE .The Davidson implementation of the qEOM-UCCSD algorithm provides the advantage over the qEOM and EOM-VQE by reducing the working Hilbert space significantly. The classic Davidson method iteratively interacts with the outcome from the quantum devices and provides feedback to grow the ansatz (vector space) to prepare desired quantum states.The implementation provides several advantages compared to the currently available excitedstate methods in quantum computing. First, qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson significantly reduces the computational demand for classical diagonalization step, because the dimension of the resulting subspace Hamiltonian only spanned by a few guess vectors. In the case of its variational variant, the Davidson algorithm provides the certain electronic configurations that are expected to contribute to the target excited states. Therefore, it introduces a significantly smaller number of variational parameters resulting in a significantly reduced searching space.In addition, similarly to the classical variant, the presented Davidson algorithm produces the excited state of the desired spatial or spin symmetry (in the case of the closed-shell references). The qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson can target the specific group of transitions by defining suitable subspace vectors and can be extended to target higher-energy states or specific transitions . Apart from the advantages of using', 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b41"">[42] . The focus of this paper is on the incorporation of the Davidson procedure into the qEOM protocol, which we call the qEOM-UCC/Davidson algorithm. The key feature of the Davidson implementation on quantum devices is the design of a unitary ansatz that generates specific quantum superposition states, which is achieved by using Gray code decomposition . The proposed ansatz enables targeting a specific subspace within the Hilbert space based on the feedback from the Davidson procedure. Hence, instead of computing the entire eigen-spectrum of the Hamiltonian, our qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson algorithm is capable of computing several transitions of a particular type by defining suitable subspace vectors. Here we focus on finding low-lying states of a given symmetry/spin, but the algorithm can be easily extended to finding states around the specified energy or of a particular type (e.g., such as excitations between specific orbitals).The structure of the paper is as follows: Sec. II A discusses EOM formalism, Sec. II B describes the choice of the ground-state ansatz for quantum computing and its incorporation within EOM, Sec. II C explains the Davidson procedure with qEOM implemented on quantum devices, Sec. II D presents the detailed circuit design, and Sec. III presents the variational extension of the proposed algorithm. Sec. IV provides computational details of illustrative calculations and Sec. V presents the numerical results using a set of small molecules (H 2 , H 4 , LiH, and H 2 O). Sec. VI gives our concluding remarks.', 'on a quantum device and then solves the eigenvalue problem of Eq. ( ) on a classical computer. Thus, qEOM also needs classical machines to diagonalize the measured matrix. The number of matrix elements to measure on quantum computers and the dimension of the matrix to diagonalize on classical computers depend on the level of correlation treatment and the one-electron basis set. By restricting the excitation levels to singles and doubles, the quantum computer is required to measure about N ∼ n occ × n vir + n 2 occ × n 2 vir matrix elements and the classical computer is required to diagonalize N × N matrix, which scales as O(N 3 ). Although the dimension of the matrix M can considerably be reduced by utilizing the sparsity and symmetries of the Hamiltonian, the scaling quickly reaches the intractable regime as the system size increases.Eqs. ( ) and (22), which are the working equation of qEOM with the self-consistent manifold operator, are the same as in the standard EOM-CC method except for the form of the effective Hamiltonian. In the standard EOM-CC calculation, we iteratively determine only a few eigenvalues using the Davidson algorithm instead of explicit diagonalization of the entire matrix M . Here, we present the implementation of this idea within the qEOM method (we focus on the standard Davidson algorithm for low-lying states, but it can be extended to compute interior states or states of a particular character ).In order to compute J excited states, qEOM-UCC/Davidson starts with generating a set of appropriate L orthonormal guess vectors, {|b i ⟩} L≥J i=1 . Then, we measure the matrix elements of H in the given guess vector space and build the subspace Hamiltonian using a quantum', 'standard EOM-CCSD, it scales as ∼ O(n 6 ) . Hence, the major advantage of using quantum devices stems from the efficient evaluation of σ-vectors giving rise to the efficient evaluation of matrix elements of H. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the deviation of the approximate eigenvectors, |c k ⟩, from the true eigenvectors by computing the residual vectors|r k ⟩ = ( H -λ k )|c k ⟩ = L i=1 c k i ( H -λ k )|b i ⟩, k = 1, • • • , J.(28)As per Eq. ( ), the residual vectors are zero for the true eigenvectors. The convergence is assessed by the norm of residual vectors, which also can be measured on quantum devices.The residual vectors |r k ⟩ are linear combinations of excited Slater determinants. Thus, the evaluation of the norms of residual vectors is equivalent to probing the composition of residual vectors, i.e., measurements of overlaps between excited Slater determinants and residual vectors||r k || = N µ=1 |⟨Φ µ |r k ⟩| 2 . (29)Note that {c k i } L,J i=1,k=1 , {λ k } J k=1 , and {b i } L i=1 of Eq. ( ) are already known from the previous steps. Therefore, the qEOM-UCC/Davidson only measures the overlap between Slater determinants and σ-vectors ⟨Φ µ |σ i ⟩. The final step of the qEOM-UCC/Davidson algorithm is the orthonormalization of the residual vectors to the current set of guess vectors and expansion of the vector space with the (orhtonormalized) residuals. This can be done by the Gram-Schmidt procedure on classical computers:<formula', 'C. Solving qEOM-UCCSD on quantum computers using a Davidson-like procedureSimilar to the classical electronic-structure calculations, the quantum version of EOM (qEOM) protocol computes ground state before solving the EOM problem by using variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with the choice of an appropriate ansatz, such as unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) and Hardware-efficient ansatz .

The lowest energy barrier (13.6 kcal mol -1 ) was obtained for the proR C-C coupling transition state (TS1proR,C) while the energy barrier for the proS transition state (TS1proS,C) was higher (15.4 kcal mol -1 ). The transition are characterized by the presence of an imaginary frequencies i288 cm -1 and i273 cm -1 for TS1proR,C and TS1proS,C respectively. Furthermore, in the TS1proR,C transition state a hydrophobic interaction from M105 was observed with 3, while no such interaction of 3 was observed in TS1proS,C. The system then relaxed to the low energy state intermediates Int1proR,C and Int1proS,C, which are characterized in the local minima state by the presence of all real frequency values indicating stable structures. The Int1proR,C has lower energy (6.7 kcal mol -1 ) than the Int1proS,C configuration (9.8 kcal mol -1 ), which favours the proR configuration pathway over the proS pathway. This is consistent with the experimentally observed preference to produce the R enantiomer by SCP_Q111CBpy (Table ).Overall, the substrates' activation in FC alkylation mechanism with SCP_Q111BpyAla favours the formation of proS product over proR while with SCP_Q111CBpy favours proR product formation over proS. However, the products distribution was achieved via a competitive pathway, so a mixture of both enantiomers of the product is predicted, which agrees well with our experimental results.

The transition states were characterized by an imaginary frequency i308 cm \uf02d1 and i319 cm \uf02d1 for TS1proS,B and TS1proR,B respectively. Furthermore, in transition state TS1proS,B, indole 3 has strong water bridge interactions with D88 that make it more stable than the TS1proR,B, which has a week hydrogen bonding interaction with M112. Subsequently, the transition states are relaxed to their respective intermediates (Int1proS,B and Int1proR,B), which characterized by lower relative energy values: 1.65 and 7.92 kcal mol \uf02d1 , Thus, the proS configuration pathway is energetically favoured over the proR configuration pathway. Taken together these analyses explain the preferred enantioselectivity of SCP_Q111BpyAla (e.r. 14:86, R:S) that we observed experimentally (Table ). In a similar manner, the FC alkylation reaction mechanism catalysed by SCP_Q111CBpy (Model C) was explored.

The optimized geometries of these reactant complexes ReproS,C and ReproR,C are represented in Figures and. The free energy of the ReproS,C structure is higher than the ReproR,C by 5.6 kcal mol -1 (∆E + ZPE), indicating that the reactant complex of model C in proR configuration shows the strongest substrate-bound pose and hence signifies the favoured reactant orientation.Finally, the FC reaction pathway of Cu(II)-bound SCP_Q111CBpy was explored, using ReproS,C and ReproR,C reactants as the starting structures.

Model A represents a reaction catalysed by Cu(II)-2,2ꞌ-bipyridine, in the absence of protein, whereas models B and C represent reactions catalysed by Cu(II)-bound SCP_Q111BpyAla and SCP_Q111CBpy, respectively. The computational analysis on Model A (Figure ESIb) showed that the conjugate coupling step is both the rate-determining step as well as the enantioselective step, and the formation of the keto product is most likely. This agrees well with the experimental results (Table ) as well as previous studies , therefore only the first step was modelled going forwards. To create models B and C, the indole 3 and enone 4 substrates, along with Cu(II) ions, were incorporated into the crystal structures of Cu(II)-bound SCP_Q111BpyAla and SCP_Q111CBpy, respectively. The PDB files of the apo SCP_ArMs were prepared as described in the ESIb, and 3 and 4 were docked using AutoDock Vina , with the lowest energy docked poses used for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (see ESIb for detailed methods and results).

Firstly, the conjugate addition of indole 3 to enone 4, where substrate 3 configuration is either proS or proR was tested.

Enantioselective product formation was only observed in the presence of the Bpycontaining SCP-metalloenzymes. SCP ArMs with BpyAla showed a higher yield (42-45%) compared to the equivalent Cyscoupled Bpy SCP ArMs. Among the novel ArMs, SCP_Q111BpyAla displayed the greatest enantioselectivity with an e.r. of 20:80 (±1), favouring the S enantiomer, and a yield of 42% (Table , entry 9). The BpyAla moiety in this SCP ArM is situated at the centre of one side of the tunnel, in the middle of \uf061-helix 5 (Figure and 3A). By contrast, the ArMs with BpyAla situated at either end of the tunnel showed either no enantioselectivity in the case of SCP_A100BpyAla (Table , entry 7), or lower enantioselectivity with a preference for the R enantiomer (Table , entry 8). We hypothesise that the lower selectivity at the entries to the tunnel could be due to increased flexibility and space leading to less defined binding pocket, compared to position Q111 in the centre of the tunnel. While enantioselectivity towards the R enantiomer was observed with all three Cys mutants, it was limited with the best result observed for SCP_A100CBpy which gave a 66:34 ratio (Table , entries 4-6).Both enantiomers of 5 can be obtained in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation using SCP-ArMs with Bpy attached to residue 111, but by using different attachment strategies', 'ConclusionsUsing two different approaches to forming artificial metalloenzymes, a library of successful catalysts for the Cu-catalysed Friedel Crafts alkylation were obtained. Moderate activities and good enantiomeric ratios were observed with SCP_Q111BpyAla giving the highest e.r. of 14:86 in favour of the S enantiomer. In general, lower enantioselectivities were observed for the cysteine-modified catalysts and this is attributed to increased flexibility around the active site due to the additional S-CH2 linker. Changing from genetic incorporation of BpyAla at Q111 to bioconjugation of bipyridine through a cysteine, resulted in an unexpected change in the major isomer observed from S to R, albeit with a reduction in enantiomeric excess. This result is intriguing as a major challenge in enzyme catalysis is accessing the opposite product enantiomer. Crystallographic and computational studies confirm that changes in the structure of the active site led to the stabilisation of indole 3 on different sides of the bound enone 4, with the enantiomeric ratios observed correlating with the difference in the calculated transition state energies for the proR and proS SCP_Q111BpyAla and SCP_Q111CBpy Cu catalyst models. Based on these findings, future work should prioritize determining the most suitable modification method for the desired application of the ArM before proceeding with reaction screening and optimization, as subtle differences in protein structure can substantially change the stabilised transition state.The crystal structure obtained of SCP-Q111BpyAla_Cu is a rare example of a protein structure containing an unnatural amino acid.

392,"IntroductionPhotochemical and photophysical reactions in transition-metal complexes occur when the compound is excited to higher-lying electronic states via light absorption. The complex can then experience a cascade of processes involving different electronic states connected through the motion of the molecules' nuclei. The participation of different electronic states introduces new flexibility to the system by opening up reaction pathways beyond the ones that are accessible in thermal ground-state chemistry. This flexibility then lays the foundation to the many application found in photochemistry , covering areas as diverse as catalysis, memory storage, energy storage, display and lighting technology, or medicine. While a blessing for applications, the flexibility is a challenge for the rational design of photoactive materials, as it needs to control not only the properties of the different electronic states but also the motion connecting them.

In this way, static investigations can often establish heuristic models of photoreactions. Equipped with modern computational resources and efficient quantum chemistry programs, such approaches have become affordable to allow even screening of large libraries of photoactive compounds, albeit somewhat restricted to the usage of low-cost black-box electronic structure methods. Beyond the heuristic models, more insight into the mechanisms of photoreactions can be gained by simulating their dynamics explicitly. Depending on the problem of interest, different techniques exist to simulate the nuclear motion of a molecule on the potential energy surfaces of its electronic states. For small molecules or reactions depending only on a small number of nuclear degrees-of-freedom, highly accurate quantum wave-packet dynamics can be employed , while for larger-sized problems typically mixed-quantum-classical approaches such as nonadiabatic molecular dynamics are employed.

The only alternative is then to screen larger numbers of compounds as is done in the present work using computer simulations for a class of near-infrared emitting vanadium(III) complexes. Starting from the mechanism of the known emitter VCl 3 (ddpd) (ddpd = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-dipyridine-2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine), we establish design principles including an increase in the ligand-field strength in the complex in order to achieve higher emission quantum yields. Based on these principles, we design a large set of complexes that are tested for larger ligandfield splitting in static quantum chemistry calculations. For the subset of complexes with increased ligand-field splitting, we then perform nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and identify two promising near-infrared emitter with potential similar or increased emission quantum yield compared to the VCl 3 (ddpd) reference.

In this work, we demonstrate this by screening the photophysics of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes derived from VCl 3 (ddpd). This complex, after excitation from the triplet ground state and following intersystem crossing to the singlet manifold, shows singlet-to-triplet phosphorescence in the nearinfrared region. Based on an analysis of the relaxation mechanism of VCl 3 (ddpd), we developed the hypothesis that by increasing the ligand-field strength in the complex could shift the electronic states to modify the mechanism in such a way as to lead to a higher phosphorescence yield. This was to be achieved by channeling more population from the triplet to the singlet states as well as reducing the amount of singlet-to-triplet reverse intersystem crossing that reduces the population available for phosphorescence.We then tested our hypothesis in two steps. First, we designed 18 complexes based on design principles established for other 3dmetal complexes with large ligand-field splitting. Thereby we found that strategies of including ligands that are strong σ -donors or both σ and π donors are particularly successful.

Applied to electronically excited states, on-the-fly computed machine-learning potentials have both enabled nanosecond-timescale nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and screening of large compounds classes of organic molecules. For excited-state properties of transition-metal complexes, machine-learning approaches so far are scarce and lacking behind.

This difficulty in predicting excited-state decay pathways translates directly to the rational design of open-shell 3d-luminophores, which instead of single available examples rather must draw from a wide array of tested candidate complexes, which makes efforts such as this screening study all the more needed.']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Unclassified']",510,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9924141820679796,0.0,"['which', 'transition-metal']"
592,"structural study (M06-2X/6-31G with a polarizable continuum model for dichloromethane solvent) that shows non-planarity in the calculated ground state minimized structure of SOPS in solution (see Supporting Information, Figures and). Variance amongst the SOPS λmax (Soret and Q bands) is modest (Table ); the largest range can be seen in Q4, where the lowest (TPP-Si(OSi t BuMe2)2, 1c) and highest (TPP-Si(OSiPh3)2, 1i) λmax are Table  separated by 15 nm (618 and 633 nm, respectively). This absorption data demonstrates that the selection of a particular silyloxy cap can be used to control the structure of the porphyrin ring.The examined porphyrins were fluorescent in a dichloromethane solution (Table and Figure ). For 2 we observed a very strong emission band at 650 nm and a much smaller emission at 711 nm. This two-emission profile is typical of porphyrins, and is attributed to two tautomeric states. In toluene, 2 has the same λmax as in dichloromethane but emits relatively more intensely at 711 nm. This demonstrates that environmental effects (i.e. solvent) impact the population distribution of the two tautomers but not the energy of the individual HOMO-LUMO gaps. When the SOPS (1a-i) were excited at their respective Soret bands in solution, two emission signals were noted: one around 600 nm and another closer to 650 nm (Table and Figure ). The ~50 nm blue shift of the SOPS with respect to 2 corresponds to what is seen in fluorescent metalloporphyrins such as TPP-Zn. Interestingly, 3 fluoresces at three distinct λmax: 600, 650, and 711 nm. This finding suggests that compound 3 either",Comparative,"Which has a higher λmax value, TPP-Si(OSi t BuMe2)2, 1c or TPP-Si(OSiPh3)2, 1i?","TPP-Si(OSiPh3)2, 1i has a higher λmax value than TPP-Si(OSi t BuMe2)2, 1c.",Easy,"['the largest range can be seen in Q4, where the lowest (TPP-Si(OSi t BuMe2)2, 1c) and highest (TPP-Si(OSiPh3)2, 1i) λmax are separated by 15 nm (618 and 633 nm, respectively).']","[[234, 486]]","['impacts this arrangement.Influence of Axial Substitution on Solubility. Owing to their large, three-dimensional hydrophobic surfaces, SOPS (1a-i) have much greater solubility in organic solvents than TPP (2), as seen in Table . There were also noticeable differences in solubility between the series of aliphatic SOPS and the series  of aromatic SOPS; these differences were used to our advantage in the purification process (see Supporting Information). The improved solubilities of the SOPS compared to 2 can be rationalized by considering the non-covalent interactions between the molecules in the solid state. Porphyrins that lack axial capping groups, such as 2, are known to experience favorable face-toface aromatic interactions between their large, exposed π-surfaces. These interactions cause aggregation, which in turn can red-shift absorption and quench fluorescence. On the other hand, analysis of the packing structures of 1f-i (see Supporting Information, Figures , 46, and 48) shows that the bulky axial caps prevent this interaction. As an illustrative example, there are three molecules near the axial cap of 1h (Figure ), but none come into close contact with the surface of the porphyrin ring system itself; they contact the cap instead. A Hirshfeld surface plot of 1h (Figure ) and interaction energy calculations (see Supporting Information, Tables S3-12 and Figures ) confirm that these interactions between the neighboring molecules are dominated by van der Waals forces. The SOPS contact one another at distances that correspond closely to the sum of the respective van der Waals radii, as can be seen by the large areas of white in the Hirshfeld', 'on the more practical aspects of this synthesis, particularly in reference to key intermediate 2-SiCl2.While stable in open air and during neutral aqueous workup, the Si-Cl bonds in the PorSil are labile enough that reaction quickly and quantitatively occurs between 2-Si(Cl)2 and silica gel (in both column and thin-layer chromatography (TLC)). Neither the precursor (2) nor subsequent product (3) display such reactivity. This allows for facile tracking of reaction progress in either the generation of 2-SiCl2 from 2 or consumption of 2-SiCl2 to make 3, as 2-SiCl2 is completely immobile on a silica TLC plate. NMR Analysis. The NMR spectra of the synthesized SOPS provide insight into the structural and electronic characteristics of these molecules (Figure ). The quadrupole of the aromatic porphyrin shields the alkyl/aryl protons of the silyloxy axial substituents resulting in marked upfield shifts of these signals. This was not unexpected: N-H protons in 2 -which also lie in the shielded porphyrin core -are observed at -2.75 ppm and similar upfield shifts are observed for axial substituents in related PorSils and SiPcs. This shielding falls off with distance from the silane (and thus the center of the quadrupole); for example, in TPP-Si(OSiPh3)2 (1i), the signal for the ortho protons (HE) is visible at 4.69 ppm, significantly upfield from the usual aromatic region, and the signal for the meta protons (HF) is observed at 6.57 ppm (Figure ). An additional consequence is that while phenylsilanes typically have overlapping signals for the meta (HF) and para (HG) protons, such protons in these compounds (i.e. 1f-i) are completely resolved, with Δδ of 0.26-0.32 ppm. A similar effect is observed in the 13 C NMR spectra, with significant upfield shifts observed for the axial silane substituents (see', 'Scheme 1. Synthesis of the target library of bissilyloxy porphyrin silanes (SOPS).Reagents and conditions: i. HSiCl3, Et3N, rt, 24 h, 85%; ii. tetrahydrofuran, water, reflux, 2 h, quantitative; iii. chlorosilane (RCl), Et3N, 1,2-dichloroethane, reflux, 16 h, 82-97%. While the proton resonance for HB appears at approximately 8.1-8.2 ppm (Figure ) in the spectra of 2 and alkyl capped derivatives 1a-e, it is shifted upfield to 7.4-8.0 ppm for 1f-i. We attribute this effect to through-space interactions between HB and the aromatic ring(s) of the capping groups in 1f-i; such interactions are also observed in the solid state (see Supporting Information, Figures ). All NMR spectra acquired at ambient temperature were well-resolved; this evidence of rapid conformational sampling suggests that these intramolecular contacts do not restrict bond rotation. There is, however, a distinct broadening of the aromatic peaks of the silyloxy cap in 1f at low temperatures, indicating anisotropy due to slow conformational sampling. We were unable to reach a temperature low enough to sufficiently slow the rate of interconversion such that two distinct species could be detected (see Supporting Information, Figure ).Impact of Axial Substitution on Porphyrin Planarity. Por-Sils have previously been observed to have distortion in the planarity of the ring system in the solid state, which is due to the small size of silicon relative to the porphyrin cavity size. In these instances, the porphyrin core slightly contracts to allow for sufficient orbital overlap between the pyrrole nitrogen atoms and the electron-deficient silicon atom. These non-planar porphyrins can adopt a variety of conformations, including ruffled and', 'at three distinct λmax: 600, 650, and 711 nm. This finding suggests that compound 3 either i) possesses optical character similar to both free base and metalloporphyrin and/or ii) has an additional redshifted emission due to aggregation. The population distribution between the emission bands at ~600 and ~650 nm differs from that seen in the SOPS. It is clear that the silyloxy cap is impacting ring electronics, perhaps as a consequence of inhibition of aggregation and/or influence on porphyrin planarity.Samples of 2, aliphatic SOPS 1d, and aromatic SOPS 1i were also embedded into a ZEONEX polymer matrix and examined by fluorescence (Figure ). The emission spectrum of 2 was significantly red-shifted in the ZEONEX film. Given that general environmental effects do not cause such a phenomenon in 2, this appears to be evidence of aggregation of the porphyrin in the polymer. While the SOPS did show an altered population distribution of the two tautomeric states, as evidenced by a change in relative intensities of the two emission bands, the energies of these transitions, however, were not affected. These findings support our hypothesis that silyloxy caps discourage aggregation.The electrochemical behavior of these compounds was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the full range of synthesized SOPS (Table ; for CV spectra see Supporting Information, Figures ). All SOPS underwent a reversible oneelectron oxidation with similar oxidizing potentials regardless of the identity of the silyloxy cap. However, the SOPS have slightly higher oxidation potentials (1.31-1.35 V) that those observed for 2 (1.31 V), and significantly lower than that observed for 3 (1.52 V). This increase in the oxidation potential indicates a stabilization of the HOMO of the PorSils in solution.There was more variance in the', 'of the respective van der Waals radii, as can be seen by the large areas of white in the Hirshfeld surface.Impact of Axial Substitution on Optoelectronic Properties. As expected, all the investigated porphyrins are UV-active compounds (Table , Figures and). Silylation of TPP (2) to make TPP-Si(OH)2 (3) does not significantly impact observed λmax -though there is a small general red-shift -and a J-aggregation-type Soret band is observed around 450 nm. Q1 is the strongest Q-band of both 2 and 3, indicating that the dissymmetry that exists in 2 giving rise to this optical phenomenon is also present in 3. This spectral feature lies in stark contrast to what is typically seen in two-dimensional metallated (i.e. Zn(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Fe(II)) porphyrins, which have only one or two Q-bands (with Q2 and/or Q3 persisting) due to higher levels of symmetry. Interestingly, when the silyloxy caps are installed we observe Q-band structures more like the metallated porphyrins, with Q2 being the most intense (Figure ). There is some differentiation amongst the relative molar extinction coefficients of the Q bands for SOPS; for example, 1a has almost no Q4 band, while 1b has a Q4 band that is greater in intensity than Q1. Notably, in all SOPS some degree of dissymmetry is evidenced by the presence of all four Q bands, and the respective λmax (Soret and Q bands) of the SOPS are generally redshifted compared to that of 2, with the notable exception of Q4 (Table ). Both of these observations can be attributed to the likely ruffling of the porphyrin in solution.

Compound 3 permits the determination of the T1 level because the lowest energy level of Gd 3+ (32200 cm -1 ) is well above the S1 and T1 levels of NH2-BDC (as confirmed below) and therefore only phosphorescence of the ligand can be observed.The singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) energy levels of the ligand were determined as the onsets of the fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at about 405 nm (24700 cm -1 ) and 479 nm (20900 cm -1 ), respectively (see Figure and explanation within). The energy position of T1 with respect to the 5 DJ states of Ln 3+ is one of the most relevant factors to determine the lanthanide luminescence efficiency in coordination compounds is the energy of T1 with respect to the 5 DJ states of Ln 3+ . Previous studies have shown that for efficient room temperature Ln luminescence, the energy gap between the lowest T1 energy level and the emitting state of the lanthanide ion ΔE ( 3 ππ*-5 D0) should be larger than 2500 cm -1 . , To ensure a fast and irreversible energy transfer. If the offset energy is lower, a back-transfer from the Ln 3+ ion to the ligand may take place thus reducing the efficiency of the sensitized PL.The T1 of the ligand in 2 is located 3660 cm -1 above the 5 D0 state of Eu 3+ (17240cm -1 ) (see Figure for further details), which confirms that back-transfer is efficiently hindered at room temperature.

Prior to the sensing experiment, 1 and 2 were activated by exposing them to a flow of pure synthetic air (PSA) for five minutes at room temperature, with the aim of removing the non-coordinated DMF molecules inside the lattice. This activation process was confirmed by FTIR measurements (Figure and). Then, the samples were exposed to consecutive cycles of pure PSA and 5 ppm of NO2 in PSA. During exposure the variation of the luminescence intensity was recorded (see SI for further details). The time duration of each cycle (5 minutes) was long enough to reach equilibrium conditions. The results for both Ln-MOF are plotted in Figure . The exposure of 1 to 5 ppm NO2 results in a decrease in PL intensity by about 20% monitored at the peak of the emission (543 nm) and reaching a plateau after 2 min. Subsequent exposure of 1 to PSA leads to recovery of the emission intensity within a similar time frame. Contrary to the behavior of 1, exposure of 2 to 5 ppm of NO2 leads to an increase in PL by about 20% during 90 seconds until it reaches a plateau. Upon PSA exposure, the PL intensity returns to the original level. Sample 2 was cycled three times in order to show the reversible behavior of the sample. In order to further assess the gas sensitivity degree, both materials were exposed to diluted NO2 flow (from 5 to 0.5 ppm)', 'Results and DiscussionSTRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION. Three porous Ln-MOFs were synthesized according the method reported by Gamez and co-authors , {[Tb2(N-BDC) . The PL spectrum (solid green line) shows the characteristic sharp line emission from Tb 3+ ions corresponding to 5 D4→ 7 FJ (J = 2-6) transitions located at 642, 622, 586, 544 and 489 nm, respectively. Simultaneous emission from the ligand is manifested as a broad underlying band in the 400-550 nm range with a maximum at 445 nm. The PLE spectrum of 1 (dashed green line), obtained by monitoring the emission at 544 nm ( 5 D4→ 7 F5 transition in Tb 3+ ), exhibits a broad band due to the ligand indicating photosensitization of Tb. Regarding 2•2DMF, the PL spectrum exhibits sharp peaks at 580, 593, 617, 651 and 697 nm assigned to 5 D0→ 7 FJ (J = 0-4) transitions in Eu 3+ (solid red line in Figure ), in agreement with previous reports. Similar to the case of 1•2DMF, the PLE spectrum monitored at 617 nm ( 5 D0→ 7 F2) exhibits a broad band covering the 300 -450 nm range associated to the organic ligand. Concerning 3, the PL and PLE spectra are summarized in Figure . The PL spectrum (solid purple line) shows a broad band in the 400-700 nm range with a maximum at 454 nm, corresponding to the ligand emission. Note that the lowest energy level of Gd 3+ (32200 cm -1 ) is well above the S1 and T1 levels of NH2-BDC (as confirmed below) and therefore no quenching of the ligand emission by energy transfer to Gd 3+ occurs. The PLE spectrum of 3 (Figure dashed purple line) exhibits a broad band assigned to the organic ligand.In order to understand the Ln 3+ sensitization mechanisms and the nature of the', 'bound to NO2 (see Fig. ). As the NO2 molecule is rigidly displaced from the binding configuration to larger distances from the ligand, the triplet state shifts to higher energies. The first excited triplet state, T1, exhibits a dominant π to π* (HOMO to LUMO) character and is predicted to be at 22398 cm -1 (Figure ). When the NO2 is hydrogen bonded to the ligand the triplet is at 22137 cm -1 (see Figure ) corresponding to a downshift in energy by approximately 260 cm -1 . The computed downshift of T1 as a function of the distance between NO2 and the ligand is found to linearly correlate with the ligand-to-molecule charge transfer (see Figure ). By making use of this linear regression and the computed charge transfer within the MOF, the T1 downshift is estimated to be in the 230-410 cm -1 range, approximately, in the MOF, depending on the binding configuration.Summarizing, the downshift of T1, upong NO2 adsorption, leads to opposed luminicence scenarios in 1 and 2 (see Figure ). The results are rationalized as follows. In 1, the ligand T1 level is pushed only about 200 cm -1 above the 5 D4 level of Tb 3+ after adsorption of NO2, leading to a detrimental effect on the PL quantum yield. The two states are close in energy and the back transfer is enhanced thus decreasing the luminescence quantum yield , . Conversely, NO2 binding in 2 results in a smaller T1 -5 D1 energy offset, (from 1900 cm - 1 to 1640 cm -1 ), promoting triplet-to-Eu 3+ transfer rates as well as the total PL quantum yield. These theoretical predictions are in accordance with our experimental findings. ', 'the gas sensitivity degree, both materials were exposed to diluted NO2 flow (from 5 to 0.5 ppm) while keeping similar measurement conditions. The results shown in Figure demostrate that both samples maintain the same PL behaviour even at low pressure: the lower sensing detection with our setup for 1 is 0.5 ppm (LOD of 1.8 ppm) and for 2, 1 ppm (LOD of 2.2 ppm).Importantly, exposure of 3 to NO2 did not lead to significant changes in PL intensity, confirming that NO2 has negligible effect on the ligand emission, this reversible change in the luminescence intensity of 1 and 2 must be associated to the NO2 adsorption/desorption process inside the Ln-MOF.As previously proposed for a closely-related Ln-based porous compound, the NO2 molecule could interact within the MOF via three different mechanism; i) bonding to the metal centers, , ii) reacting with pendant groups of the ligand, , or iii) interacting non-covalently with the ligand. , , All three options are discussed below.Figures and already show no noticeable spectral shifts or changes in the crystal field splitting in the emission lines assigned to the 5 D0→ 7 FJ, J=1...4 and 5 D4→ 7 FJ, (J=2-6) transitions from either Tb 3+ or Eu 3+ ions, upon gas absorption.

The most obvious difference between the four spectra is the lower intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra of the cell on the soft PA gel attached to the custom substrate. Because this feature is absent in the spectra of the stiff PA gel on a custom substrate, it is not likely due to either the custom substrate itself or to differences in the reagents used to attach the photopolymerized and thermally polymerized gels to the custom substrate and commercial substrate, respectively. Instead, we attribute the low intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra acquired from the soft PA gel on the custom substrate to a low degree of polymerization within this gel. This interpretation is supported by our observation that the intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 increases with the UV exposure time (Figure .b), and prior reports that assign the spectral peaks at 830-850 cm -1 to polyacrylamide .Comparison of the average spectra acquired from cells on each combination of PA gel stiffness and substrate (Figure .b) reveals the spectra acquired from both the custom substrate and the commercially available (Thorlabs) substrate are roughly comparable. However, the average spectra from CHO cells on the custom substrate have higher standard deviation.Because photopolymerization produces gels with a larger range of stiffness than thermal polymerization, this higher variance is due to the use of photopolymerization to create the PA gels on the custom substrates and thermal polymerization to create the PA gels on the substrates purchased from Thorlabs.

However, these Thorlabs substrates were relatively expensive, and the difficulty of removing the cellular material and PA gel residue without damaging the silicate coating prevented their reuse. Furthermore, their dimensions of the commercially available substrates (6 mm tall and 12.7 mm diameter) were poorly suited for cell analysis because their height made media spillage inevitable during handling. These challenges inspired us to fabricate an inexpensive custom Raman-compatible substrate with dimensions that are better suited for constructing the envisioned biomaterial screening platform.Here, we use standard fabrication techniques to produce a custom Raman-compatible substrate that supports microarray construction and the acquisition of Raman spectra with sufficient quality to allow accurate identification cell phenotype with our PLS-DA and Raman spectroscopy approach.

We excluded any proteins that we identified in these non-specific binding samples as they should not interact with neutravidin resin due to the lack of biotin modification.

Among the 285 proteins with increased VLCFAcylation during necroptosis, 158 were only detected in necroptotic cells. Based on our previous work suggesting increased VLCFA levels and protein fatty acylation could be involved in necroptosis , we initially turned our attention to proteins with increased VLCFAcylation during necroptosis.Intriguingly, MLKL was one of these proteins which appeared to be modified by C20:0 alkFA only during necroptosis. Our proteomics data set is limited in distinguishing peptides from unmodified ones, therefore little information was obtained whether MLKL and/or pMLKL was acylated. Hence, we investigated the fatty acylation of MLKL and pMLKL using western blotting.We enriched fatty acylated proteins from control and necroptotic cells as we described above and analyzed protein content using western blotting. We detected both MLKL and pMLKL in necroptotic cells but not in control cells suggesting that both MLKL and pMLKL can be fatty acylated during necroptosis and that their acylation is not appreciable in the absence of necroptotic activity (Figure ). In order to understand the nature of acylation, we treated control and necroptotic cells with C20:0 alkFA, fractionated membrane proteins and installed Biotin-azide.

1072,"ConclusionHeterostructural alloys of wurtzite AlN and rocksalt M N are promising materials for a host of applications, including optoelectronic, ferroelectric, and neutron detection, among others.A fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics of alloy stability, phase transition, and solubility of M cations is, therefore, central to designing and optimizing Al 1-x M x N alloys. We have performed a joint computational and experimental study on the incorporation of Gd 3+ into AlN, creating a heterostructural alloy Al 1-x Gd x N between rocksalt GdN and wurtzite AlN. First-principles calculations using density functional theory in conjunction with SQS supercells reveal that the critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82. The calculated mixing free energy indicates that at equilibrium conditions and at temperatures below 1000 K, there is a large miscibility gap and only a few percent of Gd can be incorporated in AlN. Higher (effective) temperatures that can be accessed with non-equilibrium growth methods will enable higher Gd incorporation. By exploiting these non-equilibrium growth conditions experimentally via combinatorial RF co-sputtering, we have achieved significantly higher Gd concentrations in the wurtzite phase (x ≈ 0.25) than in previous thin film syntheses and therefore significantly expanded the range of alloys in this new materials system. Future growth optimization may be able to further increase the range of Gd that can be incorporated into AlN. Expanding our computational analysis to Pr 3+ and Tb 3+ , which show similar behavior to Gd 3+ , and comparing ionic size effects with electronegativity for all the cations that have been considered for substitution into AlN allows us to develop design rules for Al 1-x M x N alloys.

Using alloy models in conjunction with density functional theory, we explored the full composition range for Al 1-x Gd x N and found that wurtzite is the ground state structure up to a critical composition of x = 0.82. The calculated temperature-composition phase diagram reveals a large miscibility gap inducing spinodal decomposition at equilibrium conditions, with higher Gd substitution (meta)stabilized at higher temperatures. By depositing combinatorial thin films at high effective temperatures using radio frequency co-sputtering, we have achieved the highest Gd 3+ incorporation into the wurtzite phase reported to date, with single-phase compositions at least up to x ≈ 0.25 confirmed by high resolution synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering. High resolution transmission electron microscopy 1 on material with x ≈ 0.13 confirmed a uniform composition polycrystalline film with uniform columnar grains having the wurtzite structure. Expanding our calculations to other rare earth cations (Pr and Tb) reveals similar thermodynamic stability and solubility behavior to Gd.

Given the recent interest in other AlN alloys for electrical and piezoelectric applications, as well as unique properties of Gd (such as possessing the largest known neutron capture cross section), Gd 3+ -substituted wurtzite AlN is an appealing material to study for possible functional applications.We describe here the first synthesis of Al 1-x Gd x N with Gd-cation fraction (x) at least up to ∼0.24 in a confirmed wurtzite structure. We present the results of our joint computational and experimental investigation into the solubility and stability of Gd 3+ in the AlN wurtzite structure. First-principles calculations of the mixing enthalpy reveal a high critical composition at which the ground state transitions from wurtzite to rocksalt. However, the calculated temperature-composition phase diagram indicates that high (effective) temperatures are needed to incorporate a large amount of Gd 3+ in a metastabilized wurtzite alloy with AlN. We confirm this experimentally by depositing combinatorial thin films of Al 1-x Gd x N with radio-frequency magnetron co-sputtering and performing structural and compositional characterization. Expanding our computational analysis to Pr 3+ and Tb 3+ allows us to elucidate the effects that govern the solubility of large 3+ cations in wurtzite AlN.', 'Thermodynamics of Other Al 1-x M x N AlloysGiven the widespread interest in Al 1-x M x N-based (M : group-3 transition metal or rareearths) alloys, and motivated by our success in realizing Gd-rich Al 1-x Gd x N, we computationally investigated the formation thermodynamics of related alloys. The goal here is to:(1) assess whether M -rich heterostructural Al 1-x M x N alloys can be (meta)stabilized using similar non-equilibrium thin-film growth used for Al 1-x Gd x N, and (2) derive trends across the series of Al 1-x M x N alloys and formulate design principles. Figure shows the calculated formation thermodynamics of Al 1-x Tb x N and Al 1-x Pr x N alloys. For consistency, the same DFT methodology as used for Al 1-x Gd x N alloy calculations is adopted for the Tb and Pr analogues. Here, Tb is chosen because of its similar ionic size and electronegativity to Gd and Pr because it lies in the lanthanoid series between La (no f electrons) and Gd.The critical compositions (x c ) for wurtzite→rocksalt phase transition in the three Al 1-x M x N alloy systems studied here are 0.82 (M = Gd), 0.84 (M = Tb), and 0.87 (M = Pr). Previous computational studies have predicted x c for other AlN alloys with group-3 binary nitrides, shown in Table . We observe a non-monotonic change in x c as we move down group 3 and across the lanthanide series, with x c first increasing from Sc → La and then decreasing through to Yb. The trend is counter-intuitive if one considers only the changes in the ionic size. The M 3+ cation sizes in octahedral coordination, which is the native coordination in the ground-state M N rocksalt phase, are tabulated in Table . Here, the systematic decrease in the ionic radii beyond La is due to the well-known ""lanthanide contraction."" La has the the largest ionic', 'Thermodynamics of Al 1-x Gd x N AlloysWe calculated the thermodynamics of Al The ∆H m curves are obtained by fitting second-order polynomials to a set of data points computed at discrete x values. We find that wurtzite is the ground-state structure of Al 1-x Gd x N alloys up to a critical composition of x c = 0.82, beyond which the ground-state structure is rocksalt. We also considered a layered hexagonal-BN like structure of the alloys, but we find it to be energetically unfavorable as compared to the wurtzite and rocksalt structures over the full compositional range (Figure ). continuity in the spinodal line at x c is due to the incommensurate lattices of wurtzite and rocksalt, requiring a reconstructive phase transition. Beyond the unstable region is a region where single-phase alloys are metastable. The metastable region extends up to the binodal line, which can be obtained through the common tangent construction to ∆F m curves (not shown in Figure ). Above the binodal line, single-phase alloys are miscible and thermodynamically stable. We restrict our discussion to the unstable and metastable regions because accessible experimental conditions most likely fall within these regions.The large miscibility gap in the T (x) phase diagram at low temperatures (T < 1000 K)suggests that only small amounts of Gd can be alloyed with AlN under equilibrium conditions.Therefore, the key to synthesizing Gd-rich wurtzite Al 1-x Gd x N alloys is by accessing high (effective) temperatures under non-equilibrium conditions.

1063," Alternatively, metabolic labeling of native phospholipids has also been leveraged for expansion of membranes using click-ExM, which anchors lipids to the hydrogel network through a biotin-streptavidin conjugation. Notably, these methods require at least mild permeabilization of the membrane, which can compromise its integrity and potentially alter its structure, to ensure a uniform distribution of ExM reagents and isotropic expansion of samples.We were motivated by a desire to visualize lipids using ExM with molecular detail while preserving the structural integrity of the membranes. Here, we present an approach involving metabolic labeling of natural phospholipids, a trifunctional fluorophore for the tagging and tethering of lipids to the hydrogel, and membrane-permeable expansion reagents (Figure ).

Excitingly, we observed signal from expanded samples, demonstrating that 1 is a suitable chemical anchor that directly incorporates labeled lipids into the hydrogel network (Figure ). Using a 4 h hydrolysis step, LExM afforded a 6.8x expansion factor, enabling visualization of fine structures, e.g., the nuclear envelope, which is clearly distinguished from other intracellular membranes (Figures ). Next, we assessed the ability of LExM to expand samples in a tunable and isotropic fashion.We varied the acrylamide to acrylate hydrolysis time and compared pre-and post-LExM images of the same area using rigid registration to determine expansion factors. Hydrolysis times of 2, 4, and 8 h gave expansion factors of ~5.0x, ~6.4x and ~7.8x respectively, confirming that LExM enables the tunable expansion of membranes (Figure ). Comparison of pre-and post-LExM images with non-rigid registration revealed minimal distortion of samples, with a root mean square (RMS) error of <3% for distances of up to 10 µm, demonstrating that LExM enables the isotropic expansion of tagged lipids (Figure ).We next sought to harness the enhanced resolution afforded by LExM to identify the locations of metabolically labeled PC, an analysis that is challenged by the broad distribution of this phospholipid and the close juxtaposition of organelles at membrane contact sites. This goal required adaptation of LExM to enable colocalization studies with organelle markers using immunofluorescence.

Guided by the principles of expansion microscopy, we develop an approach featuring cell-permeable reagents that enables direct chemical anchoring of bioorthogonally labeled phospholipids into a hydrogel network and is capable of tunable, isotropic expansion, thus facilitating super-resolution imaging of cellular membranes. We apply this method, termed lipid expansion microscopy, to visualize organelle membranes with precision, including a unique class of membrane-bound structures known as nuclear invaginations. As it is compatible with standard confocal microscopes, lipid expansion microscopy will be widely applicable for super-resolution imaging of phospholipids and cellular membranes in numerous physiological contexts.', 'fluorophore for imaging pre-and post-LExM, and (iii) a methacrylamide polymerizable unit for direct incorporation into the hydrogel network. We validated that 1 is membranepermeable and capable of imaging bioorthogonally labeled lipids by confocal microscopy imaging of HeLa cells tagged with 1 after treatment with propargylcholine (ProCho), an alkynyl analog of choline that is metabolically incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (PC) and other cholinecontaining lipids (Figure ). We observed a strong fluorescent signal from many intracellular membranes, consistent with the broad distribution of PC in mammalian cells (Figure ). Importantly, the signal was ProCho-dependent, indicating that 1 is specific for alkyne-labeled phospholipids (Figure ).A key feature of ExM is isotropic sample expansion, which is achieved by disrupting membranes with permeabilization to enable uniform diffusion of polymerization reagents throughout the sample. This step is critical for incorporation of ionic monomers needed for the final osmotic expansion step, and for streptavidin-based anchoring strategies where such macromolecular fluorescent labeling reagents are membrane-impermeable. To ensure that monomers are evenly distributed in LExM, we used uncharged, membrane-permeable monomers that are hydrolyzed, post-polymerization, to yield ionic residues necessary for expansion. Our optimized LExM protocol involves metabolic labeling of cells with ProCho, fixation, fluorescent tagging with 1 via CuAAC, polymerization in the presence of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomers, denaturation and hydrolysis, and finally expansion,', 'more general strategy for ExM-based imaging of alkyne-labeled lipids, we subjected cells to IMPACT labeling with the PLD substrate hexynol, CuAAC tagging with 1, and the LExM protocol. Consistent with the ProCho-based LExM studies, IMPACT labeling generated samples with a 5.6x expansion factor (at the 4 h hydrolysis timepoint) and fluorescence signal that correlated well with the pre-LExM image (Figure ). The enhanced resolution of the post-LExM image also enabled identification of distinct membranes in crowded areas, e.g., the nuclear envelope (Figure ). Samples generated with IMPACT were similarly obtained in a tunable manner with isotropic expansion and were amenable to colocalization studies with organelle markers (Figures ). Importantly, treatment with a pan-PLD inhibitor prevented fluorescent labeling in pre-LExM images (Figure ). Finally, we applied LExM to study specific sub-diffraction scale cellular structures.Metabolic labeling of phospholipids revealed channels that traverse nuclei, which we hypothesized were a unique class of structures known as nuclear invaginations (Video S1). These channels, comprised of nuclear membrane surrounded by lamina that envelop cytoplasmic contents, can travel through nuclei. Because of their narrow dimensions, their detailed analysis has been limited to electron microscopy and traditional super-resolution microscopy (e.g., STED/SMLM). To visualize these membrane-bound structures with ExM, we labeled cells expressing a nuclear lamina marker with ProCho and performed the LExM protocol. Inspection of post-ExM', 'limit of light. With accessible reagents and requiring only a standard confocal microscope, we envision that LExM will democratize highresolution imaging of lipids and membranes.

(b). A similar trend is observed at the anode as the cathode; namely, at lower current densities there is limited acoustic activity, indicating low bubble formation, which gradually increases as the areal current density is increased. If the number of hits recorded at the anode (Figure6(b)) is compared to the number of hits recorded under the same conditions at the cathode (Figure6(a)), fewer hits are observed at each current density, suggesting lower acoustic activity indicating lower bubble formation. These results correlate with the data obtained from voltage fluctuation experiments, which indicated that bubble formation was more prevalent at the cathode than the anode. Figure 6 .6Figure 6. Acoustic emission data obtained from (a) cathode side and (b) anode side as current density (blue bars) (right axis) is increased and acoustic results (red dots) show the hit amplitude (left axis) and rate. Note that there are no acoustic hits in the current rest periods.', 'approximately 1500 s the number of acoustic hits increased more significantly. It is also observed that while there are hits just above the 25 dB threshold across the course of the experiment, increasing numbers of hits at higher acoustic amplitudes were observed as the current density increased.Notably, no acoustic activity is observed during any of the rest steps even at higher current densities, this indicated that the acoustic behavior is related to the operation of the electrolysis and not to any background effects. Tests were also repeated with the transducer in the same location but acoustically decoupled from the cell; no hits were detected during this test, ruling out any possible electromagnetic interference effects.This result suggests a change in behavior as the current density is increased, in line with the results observed from voltage fluctuation measurements. More acoustic activity is attributable to the formation of bubbles.The same experiment was repeated with the transducer placed on the anode of the electrolyser, these results are shown in Figure  In order to compare the acoustic activity at the anode and cathode at all current densities studied, the hit rate (number of hits per second) was calculated for all areal current values on both electrodes, the data from these calculations are shown in Figure range there is an increase in the rate of increase of acoustic hits per second with increasing current density, suggesting more bubble formation; this is a similar trend to that observed with the voltage fluctuation experiments. This increase in acoustic activity is observed with both the anode and the cathode. At current densities above ca.. 75 mA cm - the hit rate for the cathode is always higher than that observed at the anode, indicating more prevalent bubble formation at the cathode. At higher', 'that observed at the anode, indicating more prevalent bubble formation at the cathode. At higher current densities, above the 200-300 mA cm -2 range, this difference in acoustic activity increases further with a higher gradient observed with the cathode relative to the anode (Figure (a)). This again matches well with results obtained from voltage fluctuation experiments. This difference between the higher acoustic activity observed with the cathode relative to the anode, particularly at current densities above 200-300 mA cm -2 is more clearly observed by studying the cumulative energy of the acoustic hits (Figure (b)). Thus far, the focus has been on the number of hits recorded, which gives a good indication of the acoustic activity but does not include all information. By looking at the cumulative energy, this not only takes into account the total number of hits but other factors associated with each hit such as the duration and frequency of each hit. Based on the cumulative energy the performance of the two electrodes is relatively similar, albeit with the cathode showing slightly higher energy, until approximately 1500 s. At this point, where the current density is increased beyond 200 mA cm - prevalent at the cathode and for higher current densities above ca. 200 mA cm -2 the effect is initially larger on the cathode than the anode.', ""Electrolysis Cell using the Acoustic Emission TechniqueIn addition to the voltage fluctuation measurements, acoustic emission testing was employed to monitor bubble formation on the anode and cathode sides of the cell separately.Although this work was conducted on a cell with a slightly different layout, as outlined in Section 2.1.1, results from both set-ups were found to match closely (See Figure SI 5).The results obtained from acoustic emission testing are summarized in Figure . The use of the highly acoustically attenuating EPDM gasket between the two halves of the electrolyser allowed for the acoustic effects from each of the electrodes to be effectively isolated from one another. However, the crossover between electrodes was shown to be minimal.Constant current steps (60 s) of increasingly high areal current density were conducted with 120 s rests between each value. The acoustic emission was monitored across the course of the experiment. The results in Figure indicated that every time an acoustic event (a 'hit') was detected, it was above the chosen threshold value of 25 dB. The amplitude of each hit is indicated in each plot.For the cathode (Figure (a)) very few acoustic hits were observed at low current densities (e.g. Only two hits were observed across the 1 min, 10 mA cm -2 period), this is an indication of exceptionally low bubble formation with very limited acoustic activity. This trend for low amounts of bubble formation at low areal current densities continued across the first few current densities tested, although notably as the current density increased there was an increase in the number of hits occurring in each constant current step. After approximately 1500 s the number of acoustic hits increased more significantly. It is also observed"", ""ConclusionsIn this work, we have detected and analyzed the incidence of gas bubble formation during operation, of the cathode and anode of a high-performing capillary-fed water electrolysis cell.A voltage fluctuation and an acoustic emission technique were adapted and applied in combination, while applying current densities of up to 1 A cm -2 to the cell. Very similar resultswere obtained for the two techniques, with little bubble formation observed up to 0.17-0.20 A cm -2 . At higher current densities, up to around 0.6 A cm -2 , bubbles were formed predominantly at the cathode. Given that commercial alkaline electrolysers typically operate at current densities up to 0.6 A cm -2 , this suggests that minimizing bubble formation at the cathode offers the key opportunity for further performance improvements in the capillary-fed cell. The cathode and anode produced bubbles at similar rates at still higher current densities, to 1 A cm-2. Even at 1 A cm -2 , the rate of bubble formation on the electrodes was substantially lower than in conventional, 'bubbled' electrolysis cells. In the course of this work, the previously reported high electrochemical performance of the capillary-fed cell was independently confirmed.    IndependentFigure 1 .1Figure 1.

In the former case, there is a cluster of data near d GDS = 0, consistent with the surface propensity of I -(aq), however the corresponding VIEs are spread over a range that is not dissimilar from the spread of the entire data set. This is consistent with the similarity between bulk and interfacial VIE distributions that was documented in Fig. . It is difficult to see any correlations at all in the n HB versus VIE data. While transient fluctuations in the hydrogen-bond network are no doubt the origin of the inhomogeneous broadening of the VIE distribution, it is not so simple as saying that fewer hydrogen bonds to the ion implies a larger or smaller VIE, especially with a metric that discretizes the ion's hydra- tion shell into an integer number of hydrogen bonds.In previous MD simulations of halide ions A -(aq) at the air/water interface, Jungwirth and Tobias reported that the larger halides exhibit distinctive differences in terms of how their ion-water hydrogen bonds are oriented with respect to the surface normal, when compared to the same ions in bulk water. In that work, orientation with respect to the surface normal vector r ⊥ was measured in terms of the angle it makes with r XO , examiningcos Θ AO⊥ = r AO • r ⊥ r AO • r ⊥ .We have analyzed our I -(aq) and SCN -(aq) simulations in the same way, examining the distribution of cos( ΘAO⊥ ), where ΘAO⊥ denotes the average value of Θ AO⊥ considering each of the n HB anion-oxygen vectors r AO around the ion. (For SCN -, we take A = N.) Distributions of cos( ΘAO⊥ ) are plotted in Fig. ,"", '-, we take A = N.) Distributions of cos( ΘAO⊥ ) are plotted in Fig. , separately for the the bulk and interfacial portions of the periodic slab data, with the latter partitioned using different definitions of the interfacial region, as in Fig. . Results for I -(aq) are similar to what was reported in Ref. 11.For both I -(aq) and SCN -(aq), we find that r AO preferentially aligns towards the surface when the ion is in the interfacial region, whereas the distribution of angles is more isotropic when the ion resides in the interior of the slab. However, this alignment has seemingly no effect on the VIE. This is evident from Fig. , which presents a scatter plot of VIE versus cos( ΘAO⊥ ), analogous to the scatter plots in Fig. , and also from Fig. , which plots a joint probability distribution in VIE and cos Θ AO⊥ , stripping away the averaging over first-shell hydrogen bonds. Listed in Table are the average structural parame-ters for I -(aq), SCN -(aq), and two other ions that exhibit surface propensity (NO - 3 and ClO - 4 ), along with one that does not (NO - 2 ) as a point of comparison.

In addition to n HB , the structural parameters examined in Table include the average A -• • • H hydrogen-bond distance (r HB ) and average H-A-O ( θHB ).

The distributions cluster around r HB = 2.5-2.8 Å (iodide) and r HB = 1.9-2.2 Å (thiocyanate) with θ HB centered around 3-10 • in either case, indicating nearly linear hydrogen bonds. Quasi-linear hydrogen bonding is driven by ionwater charge transfer, and in the case of SCN -it explains the smaller value of n HB as compared to the other ions (which is consistent with experiment), since it would be difficult to accommodate a larger value of near-linear hydrogen bonds around the linear SCN -moiety.Apart from a slightly longer tail in the distribution of θ HB , there is very little difference (for either ion) between the joint probability distribution (r HB , θ HB ) that is obtained in the interior of the slab versus that obtained at the air/water interface. This is consistent with the similarity between bulk and interfacial VIEs, despite the fact that the latter property is sensitive to the short-range  and Fig. , which are averages over all of the ion-water hydrogen bonds in a given snapshot (affording values denoted rHB and θHB), these two-dimensional histograms include all of the ion-water hydrogen bonds, without averaging.

The value of n HB at the interface does decrease by about one full hydrogen bond for I -and NO - 3 , but is essentially unchanged for ClO - 4 and SCN -. Values of rHB and θHB are essentially identical in both environments, for each of these ions. In particular, the ion-water hydrogen bonds are just as close to linearity (θ HB = 0) at the air/water interface as they are in bulk water.Compelling similarities between ion-water structural parameters in the bulk and interfacial environments come into better focus when presented in the form of radar shown for both the bulk and interfacial regions of a periodic slab simulation (defined based on a GDS -3 Å partition), and also for an isotropic bulk simulation. Numerical data can be found in Table and similar plots for NO - 3 (aq) and ClO - 4 (aq) can be found in Fig. . plots; see Fig. for I -and SCN -, and Fig. for NO - 3 and ClO - 4 . Apart from differences in the total first-and second-shell coordination numbers, which are manifestations of the reduced water density at the interface, the solvation structure is remarkably similar and this imparts a corresponding similarity upon the VIEs obtained from bulk versus interfacial regions of the water slab. The radar plots also compare averages obtained from bulklike interior region of the slab to those obtained from the isotropic bulk simulations that have no air/water interface. This comparison demonstrate that our preferred partition of the slab (GDS -3 Å) affords a genuinely bulk-like region, where average structure parameters are indistinguishable from those computed in the isotropic simulations.Structural parameters rHB and θHB represent averages over all n HB ion-water hydrogen bonds in a given snapshot, but Fig. <ref type=""figure""']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Theoretical methods']",2765,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.993245330823053,-2.220446049250313e-16,['why']

Physically this is a common situation because the ground and more often the excited states change their electronic configuration as the bond displacement is changing. This results in a stronger correlation between the electronic and nuclear dynamics because, on a fast time scale, the motion of the nuclear wave packets modulates the strength of the electronic coupling. In a stationary picture this results in a broad distribution of the Franck-Condonfactors. An illustration of this effect for the Hamiltonian used in section IV.A.1, Eq. ( ), is shown in Fig. .

This is a stationary state of the Hamiltonian . In order to have more interesting features in the dynamics we introduce a non-stationary initial state by shifting the initial wave packet to the extent from the equilibrium position while keeping the mean momentum at zero. Also for such a shifted initial state the algebra remains closed.

For this case the smallest set of operators for the vibrations, is sufficient for an acceptable accuracy, see dashed lines in Fig. (a). This is consistent with our earlier results for the closed algebra. When the initial state is more displaced so that higher vibrational states are accessed we need a bigger set, , see dashed lines in Fig. (b).

This is suggested by the apparition of a step followed by an abrupt drop in the amount of the adsorbed probe in the hysteresis loop at lower relative pressures; ca. 0.4-0.42 and ca. 0.49-0.44 for argon at 87.3K and nitrogen at 77.4K,"", 'the calculated pore size distributions with those for the surface areas of the microporous structure of the materials, surface 1 was ascribed to the family of pores with an average size of 0.58 nm, while surface 2 was assumed to represent the family of micropores measuring 1.53 nm. An estimation of the relative percentage area surface 2/surface 1 yielded: ca. 22% for ZrBTC-83.5 ~ 21% for ZrBTC-114.6 > 5.0% for ZrBTC-52.4. This trend resembles the one found before for the relative mesopores to micropores surface areas. Therefore, it seems that there is a critical concentration of organic modulator that promotes the formation of Zr-MOFs structures with larger pores in both the micro and mesoporous size ranges. The ensemble of the results presented in this section agrees with literature reports , showing that the modulator serves to control the porosity of Zr-MOFs. However, as far as we know, these reports have not explored the role of the concentration of the organic modulator as presented herein. In this sense, one of the contributions of this work was establishing how the concentration of an organic modulator alters the porosity and surface area of Zr-MOFs of the 808 type in particular ways.', 'Assessment of the effect of sulfation on surface area and porosityThe argon adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding \uf063-plots for ZrBTC-114.6 and ZrBTC-114.6-S are shown in Figure . After PSM, the isotherm of the material changed. The hysteresis loop became most like a type H4 one [65] , in which the adsorption branch resembles a combination of Types I and II isotherms and the lower limit of the desorption branch is usually located at the cavitation-induced relative pressure. This behavior suggests that mesopores became clogged by sulfate groups hence inducing pore blocking and cavitation effects. Furthermore, the pore size distribution, Figure , of ZrBTC-114.6-S was starkly different from the one calculated for ZrBTC-114.6. Particularly, mesopores were enlarged while the family of micropores with an average size of 1.53 nm disappeared. These trends were consistent with the surface areas calculated through the χ-method, Table . Indeed, the total surface area of the PSM MOF decreased ca. 33 % (SAχ = 704 m 2 /g) as compared to ZrBTC-114.6 (SAχ = 1050 m 2 /g). Furthermore, the surface area corresponding to microporous from the family with an average size of 1.53 nm amounted to zero whereas the mesoporous surface area dropped ca. 83%. Also, the total pore volume exhibited a reduction of ca. ca. 54 % after PSM. These results suggest that, on the one hand, sulfate ions are hindered from entering ultramicopores in Zr-MOFs and that, on the other hand, the families of pores corresponding to the largest micropores and the mesopores of the synthesized MOFs are not connected to the ultramicropores of the materials. The latter proposal is partly supported by the fact that PSM did not change the surface area of the ultramicropores. Scheme 1 represents the above', '0.48, and 0.30 cm 3 /g, respectively with corresponding pore volumes related to mesopores of 42.0, 41.7, and 13.3 %. Thus, an increment in the concentration of modulator enhanced both the total and mesopores pore volume of the synthesized Zr-MOFs. Table presents the results for the calculated surface areas by the method derived from the χtheory . In general, the total surface area of the materials increased with the concentration of the organic modulator. This trend was qualitatively consistent with the one found when estimating surface area with the BET method, Table . Such a trend concurs with the fact that TGA tests pointed out to larger free volume spaces available for Zr-BTC114.6 (previous section). On the other hand, the χ-method allows calculating the surface area for the different families of pores of the material . Therefore, it was possible to determine that the surface areas corresponding to both the micropores and mesopores of the materials increased with the concentration of the organic modulator. The relative percentages of the mesopore surface area were ca. 30% for both ZrBTC-114.6 and ZrBTC-83.5, and ca. 17% for ZrBTC-52.4. Therefore, the value of this percentage seems to reach a plateau after reaching a certain value of concentration for the organic modulator. On the other hand, χ-method calculations accounted for the surface area of two families of pores; namely, surfaces 1 and 2 in Table , in the microporous region of the isotherm. Therefore, the contribution of the family of pores with an average size of 0.88 nm could not be differentiated from the others. Correlating the calculated pore size distributions with those for the surface areas of the microporous', 'lower relative pressures; ca. 0.4-0.42 and ca. 0.49-0.44 for argon at 87.3K and nitrogen at 77.4K, respectively; see arrow 2 in Figures and. The morphology of the mesopores can be correlated with the shape of the hysteresis loop of the isotherm. Indeed, materials presenting pore blocking effects are characterized by having pores interconnected through channels with a medium size; while materials that exhibit cavitation have narrow channels that interconnect their pores, see Figure . These channels are known as bottlenecks. Thus, the cavitation phenomena is an indication of a weak connection between pores . A schematization of these systems is shown in the insets of Figures and. Wu et al. reported that the use of acetic acid as the modulator in the synthesis of Zr based UiO-66 MOFs. The porosity of the materials synthesized by these authors was evaluated by N2 physisorption. Though the authors showed evidence for the formation of mesopores, unfortunately, their N2 physisorption results limited themselves to the adsorption branch of the isotherms hence preventing a qualitative assessment of the hysteresis loops. The authors ascribed the formation of mesopores to a lower connection between zirconium nodes that propitiated their formation, nonetheless. On the other hand, Liang et al. 14 reported the synthesis of a series of Zr-BTC MOFs whose porosity was modified by changing the chain length of the modulator by using formic, acetic, and propionic acid. However, these authors did not make any reference to the formation of mesopores for their materials.

Owing to the synergistic effect of the AIE-molecular rotors (PE) and ACQ-based chromophore units (carbazole), JUC-557-nanosheet demonstrates high absolute quantum yields (up to 23.0%) in both solid-state and solution. Also, electron-rich carbazole and electron-deficient cyan are uniformly distributed and exposed on the channel wall, rendering efficient combining with the analytes for detection. Therefore, JUC-557nanosheet as a sensitive fluorescence sensor exhibits an excellent molecular recognition toward the essential element in the human body (Fe 3+ with K a of 1.98  10 4 M -1 and LOD of 706 ppb), radioactive contaminant (I 2 with K a of 2.10  10 5 M -1 and LOD of 302 ppb), explosive (TNT with K a of 4.38  10 5 M -1 and LOD of 129 ppb), and especially toxic nitro-compounds (such as NB with K a of 6.18  10 6 M -1 and LOD of 5 ppb), which is far superior to previous fluorescence detection materials, including COFs, MOFs, POPs, small molecule probes, and inorganics. Due to its high chemical stability, JUC-557nanosheet exhibits a good luminescence and sensitive molecule recognition even under extreme conditions, such as in strong acid with pH = 1 or strong base with pH = 14.

Therefore, there is a growing demand for convenient, low-cost, real-time, and highly-efficient methods based on portable and wearable sensors. Among these sensors, optical sensor is a cost-effective and fast detection pathway for transmitting signals in intricate situations. Progress in material science and chemistry has led to several distinct classes of optical materials, e.g., molecular probes, supramolecules, amorphous polymers, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have remarkably promoted the advancement of detection of chemical and biological analytes. <ref type=""bibr""', 'Preparation and analysis of JUC-557-nanosheetCompared with bulk materials, fluorescent nanosheets usually have higher quantum yields and easily accessible combining sites for molecular recognition. Thus, we exfoliated JUC-557 into an ultrathin nanosheet (termed JUC-557-nanosheet) by sonication in the presence of methyl alcohol (MeOH, Fig. ).Notably, the highly-twisted molecular conformation of carbazole unit can weaken interlayer π-π stacking, leading to easy formation of nanosheets. As we expected, JUC-557-nanosheet displayed a graphene-like morphology (Fig. and Supplementary Figs. ). Lattice fringes between layers (~ 0.4 nm) can be observed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Fig. ). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements further confirmed a molecular-level understanding of anticipated ultrathin nanostructure. The thickness of JUC-557-nanosheet was in the range of 2.2~2.6 nm, and thus the number of layers was speculated to be 5~6 layers (Figs. 2e, 2f and Supplementary Fig. ).

However, a counterexample occurs in R1b. As shown in Figure , the fundamentally excited v3 (a spectator mode in R1b) has significant enhancement effects on the reactivity of R1b at Ec < 5.0 kcal mol -1 . Enhancing the reactivity by exciting a spectator mode was first observed in our previous work on the radical-radical reaction OH + HO2 → H2O + O2.We attributed the special mechanism to increased dipole caused by the excited OH, which makes the attraction between OH and HO2 stronger. Recently, Tian et al. reported a novel dynamical behavior that the excited low-frequency umbrella bending mode of ammonia has enhancement effects on reactivity of F( 2 P) + NH3 → HF + NH2 reaction, much more efficiently than the highfrequency stretching modes in the entire energy range of Ec, which is related to the stronger attraction induced by the excited bending mode. These unexpected results indicate that the interaction between reactants plays a significant role in the barrierless reaction, and may lead to some unique mode-specific dynamics. Figure shows the interaction potential at different H-O (in HOO') bond distances. Clearly, the attractive interaction increases with the elongation of the H-O (in HOO') bond distance. At RHO = 1.19 Å (corresponds to the outer turning point of v3 = 1), the depth of the well is increased by roughly 3.0 and 5.6 kcal mol -1 relative to that at RHO = 1.08 Å (v1 = 0) and RHO = 0.97 Å (equilibrium bond distance), respectively. The deepening of the RC well increases the chance of capturing the reactants and thus enhances the reactivity of R1b. This can be proved by Figures"", 'Although several product pathways are available in the self-reaction of HO2, it is well established that the H2O2 + O2 channel dominates on the electronic triplet state, namely, HO2 + HO2 → H2O2 + O2 ΔH(0K) = -38.3±0.10 kcal mol -1 (R1). R1 is of great significance in many situations, including combustion and Earth\'s atmosphere.This reaction significantly affects the concentrations of HOx radicals in the troposphere, and is the main source of H2O2 in the atmosphere. HOx and H2O2 are widely recognized as important species in both combustion and atmosphere. In combustion, R1, a hydrogen abstraction reaction, is a key chain termination step that inhibits ignition. The accuracy of the kinetics for R1 is important for the performance of the combustion modeling as well as engine simulations. Ample theoretical and experimental investigations have been carried out for R1 to investigate its mechanisms and kinetics over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. <ref type=""bibr""', ""Figures S4a and S4cThe initial vibrational states of one reactant HOO' are set as the ground state (GS, all v=0), v1 = 1, v2 = 1, and v3 = 1, respectively, without rotational energies. v1, v2, and v3 represent the vibrational quanta of OO' stretch, bending, and HO stretch motion of HO2, respectively. The other reactant HOO was kept at the ground vibrational state, without rotational energies. Experimentally, R1aand R1b can be distinguished by the oxygen isotopic substitution: HO O + HOO → O O + H2O2or HO OH + O2.  Figure presents the potential energies along two representative trajectories: Figure for the direct mechanism and Figure for the complex-forming mechanism. In the direct mechanism, the system undergoes a barrier and the product is formed via a direct hydrogen abstraction mechanism in a very short time. However, in the complex-forming mechanism, the strong attraction between reactants leads to a much longer residence time around RC than that in the direct one, particularly at low Ec. Thus, the system has enough time to adjust the relative orientation between reactants until the reaction occurs. Consequently, the reactivity is higher. In addition, one can see that the energies of PESH are in excellent agreement with the direct ab initio calculations for these points along the two trajectories. Returning to the discussion of mode-specificity, as shown in Figure , the excited HO stretch (v3) of HOO' can significantly enhance the reactivity of R1a in the entire energy range. This is because v3 has a strong coupling with the reaction coordinate at TS1, and depositing energy directly into the"", 'of capturing the reactants and thus enhances the reactivity of R1b. This can be proved by Figures and, in which the long-lived RC complex results in the forward-backward symmetric DCSs at low Ec. In addition, the RC complex tends to channel the flux to TS1 due to the fact that the barrier is below the reactant asymptote. The interaction potential at different O-O\' (in HOO\') bond distances and HOO\' bond angles are plotted in Figures and, respectively. As seen, the depth of the well is not increased with the increase of the bond distance or angle, even slightly decreased. Hence, exciting the two modes has no significant enhancement effects on the reactivity of R1b.Note that, the QCT approach can\'t consider the quantum effects, such as tunneling, zero-point energy conservation, and resonances. However, our previous quantum dynamics (QD) calculations yielded similar kinetics and dynamics results to the QCT calculated ones for a similar radicalradical reaction OH + HO2 → H2O + O2.  In summary, the performance of any PES reaches at most the same level of accuracy as the underlying reference data. Various density functional theory (DFT) methods have found wide successful and efficient applications for chemistry, physics, and materials related fields. However, the DFT accuracy can\'t be guaranteed generally, particularly for molecular systems. Thus, accurate theories, such as the ""gold standard"" CCSD(T) or MRCI with a large basis set, are necessary. Unfortunately, it is still prohibitive to determine energies of a large data set for complicated systems. Further, our tests have shown that for the title reaction, CCSD(T) method may easily run into convergence issues or', 'from the reactants HO2 + HO2 to the same products H2O2 + O2. One first forms the oxywater (H2OO) and O2 via the transition state TS2, which is 15.11 kcal mol -1 higher than the reactant asymptote at the UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ level. Then H2OO, not stable, can convert to its isomer H2O2 easily with an isomerization barrier (TS3) of 6.64 kcal mol - 1 . This isomerization process has been reported at various theoretical levels. This channel (via TS2, H2OO, TS3 to H2O2) has never been reported in the literature, although it is negligible due to its much high barrier even at temperatures up to 2000 K. The dominant channel is barrierless.At the UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ level, a doubly hydrogen-bonded complex well (RC, -12.29 kcal mol -1 ) is formed before reaching a hydrogen abstraction transition state (TS1, -0.30 kcal mol -1 ).RC and TS1 have been calculated at various levels. Here only the recent high-level results by Zhou et al. are included for comparison. The energies of RC and TS1 were -12.77 and -4.21 kcal mol -1 , respectively, at CASPT2/AVTZ/CBS. The characteristics of RC by Zhou et al. were similar to the current computations. For TS1, the energy deviation between the two methods is quite large, -3.91 kcal mol -1 , due to the significant differences in the TS1 geometries. For example, the forming and breaking bond distances, respectively, are 1.340 and 1.088 Å at the UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ level, compared to 1.266 and 1.132 Å by Zhou et al.

Our findings open up new opportunities for treatment of mannosidosis.Human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase (LAMAN, EC 3.2.1.24) belongs to the Zn 2+ -dependent aspartic glycosidase hydrolase family GH38. hLAMAN catalyzes the cleavage of end-terminal mannosidic linkages α(1→2), α(1→3), and α(1→6) from glycoproteins (Figure ). hLAMAN has a large globular domain (962 amino acids) with the active site centered in the helix core (Figure ). The total or partial loss of this enzyme activity by missense mutations is behind the diagnosis of the rare genetic disorder alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA). MANSA is grouped with other lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), and, although it has a very low incidence (1 out of 500,000), this number could increase because of undiagnosed patients. MANSA is characterized by several symptoms as intellectual disability, unusual facial features, or skeletal anomalies, amongst others. Despite the remarkable severity of some of the symptoms in MANSA, there is no permanent cure yet.

Overall, these changes in the Zn 2+ -coordination sphere and in the puckering of the reactant end up in significant increase in the energy barrier of the catalyzed reaction by the D74E variant. Furthermore, we wanted to look for other mutations on hLAMAN that may affect the conformation of the active site. To do this, we computed bond-to-bond propensities in the wild-type hLAMAN using the server ProteinLens to detect distal regions in the enzyme connected with the movement of the active site. In Figure and Table , we highlight the 50 residues identified to have a significant correlation with the active site within a 95 % quantile score. Interestingly, the algorithm detected two out of 26 known sequence positions related to catalytically-deficient hLAMAN variants: D159 and E402.Mutations in these positions drive to inactive variants (D159N and E402K) that, although they can fold and reach the lysosome, cannot process oligosaccharides. Visual inspection of our atomic model for wild-type hLAMAN indicates that the change D \uf0ae N on position 159 (at 10 Å from the active site) will prevent the dual interaction of the aspartic carboxylate with the amide hydrogens of A161 and A162 in the enzyme variant (Figure ). More critical is the change in position 402, where the introduction of a lysine residue in the position of a glutamic acid creates an electrostatic repulsion with the R403 amidinium group (located on the same helix) and a change in the orientation of the side chain of Q444, residue located close to one of', 'violin plots. No significant differences were found between the three systems. The variant R229W shows a slightly larger hydrophobic SASA component (+1 nm 2 ) and lower hydrophilic SASA (-0.4 nm 2 ) when compared with the wild-type enzyme (Table ), but no major conformational changes were detected in the two mutated systems (Figures and). Thus, our computational data confirm that the mutation R229W does not change the hydrophilic patterning of the surface or the total conformation of the protein, but rather modifies the network of interactions of the active site with its first sphere environment (F377).On the one hand, we have found that the Zn 2+ -dependent hLAMAN follows an E5 \uf0ae 4 H5/ 1 S5 \uf0ae 1 S5 conformational itinerary, similar to the one observed in the Ca 2+ -dependent GH92 α-mannosidase. On the other hand, overall, in this work we have used different computational approaches to understand at the atomic level the impact that several mutations have on the biological role of hLAMAN. We have shed light on the molecular basis of the pathophysiology of 4 missense mutations in LAMAN. D74E shows a larger energy barrier, D159N and E402K may affect the conformation at the active site, and R229Wdoes not impact the SASA distribution in hLAMAN and its effect should be connected with the chemical dynamics of the active site. Overall, our findings open up new avenues for targeting hLAMAN with new tools that can be used for the screening of small organic molecules with the aim of modulating its enzyme activity. Further studies are ongoing within our research group.Figure 1 .1Figure 1. (A) Example of targeted oligosaccharides by hLAMAN at the lysosome.

In MANSA, more than 130 pathogenic variants have been detected from which 54 are point mutations described to alter the normal intracellular processing and/or the 3D structure of the enzyme. As an example, the frequent R750W mutation (in more than 20% of MANSA patients) prevents the correct folding of the enzyme, and mutations like D74E, H200L or H200N alter totally the coordination sphere of the metal ion at the active site. Interestingly, out of these 54 mutations, 26 are known to have a significant loss of enzymatic activity (Table ). However, the molecular features that are responsible for preventing a full alpha-mannosidase activity still remain elusive. First, the absence of experimental structural models on hLAMAN undermines the development of fundamental knowledge of the molecular specifics behind these disabling mutations, and second, no all-atom catalytic reaction mechanism has been reported so far for this enzyme. In this work, we address these two challenges in order to unravel the structural features that connect enzyme activity and some of these disabling mutations. We first generated an all-atom molecular model for hLAMAN using the deep-learning structure from AlphaFold2 (Figure ). hLAMAN shows a very large sequence identity and structural similarity with both bovine LAMAN (bLAMAN, PDB id. 1O7D) and Drosophila melanogaster Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (GM-II, PDB id.', 'LAMAN (bLAMAN, PDB id. 1O7D) and Drosophila melanogaster Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (GM-II, PDB id. 3CZN) (see Figure and Section S1). The confidence obtained for the deeplearning model was extremely high for almost all residues in the structure of hLAMAN with exception of the N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-49), which was thus removed in our simulations. We placed the substrate \uf061-D-mannopyranose-(1-6)-\uf062-D-mannopyranose (BMA) at the active site and ran classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the \uf06ds-time scale to equilibrate, solvate and refine this complex (see Section S2). We applied distance restraints to preserve the key interactions for catalysis between the substrate BMA and both Asp196 and Asp319 residues. After equilibration, we gradually removed these constraints until we got a unrestrained system. As an outcome, we selected one snapshot of the final equilibrated system and ran quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics during 170 ps (Figure and Sections S3-S). The QM region definition included the coordination sphere of Zn 2+ (Asp196, Asp74, His72, and His445 side chains starting from the \uf062-carbon), the BMA substrate, and the side chain of the acid/base catalytic Asp319 (87 atoms in total, Figure ). We treated the QM region with the semiempirical tight-binding density functional theory DFTB3. Before simulating the enzyme-catalyzed reaction mechanism, we screened the puckering of the ring at the subsite -1 (-1 ring) in BMA for the enzyme-reactant (ER) complex (Figure and Section S3).

This additional peak is consistent with the ESA of a TIPS-Pn triplet exciton. ISC is a unimolecular process, and so it should cause the same amount of triplet formation at 0.05 mM as at 8 mM. Given negligible triplet formation was observed at 0.05 mM, the triplet formation observed at 8 mM must be due to SF. TA gives no indication of spin coherence, and so potentially the 504 nm peak could be assigned to the 1 (T...T) state. However, since this state behaves spectroscopically the same as free triplets, for simplicity we refer to it as the T 1 state.The TA spectra of dilute and concentrated TIPS-Tn exhibit differences that are similar to those in TIPS-Pn.

At both concentrations, a ground-state bleach (GSB) is observed at ∼650 nm, and a small amount of stimulated emission (SE) at ∼720 nm. For the the 0.05 mM TIPS-Pn solution (Fig. (a)), there are additional excited-state absorption (ESA) signals centered at approximately 453, 514, and 572 nm, which are consistent with previous observations of the absorption of the TIPS-Pn singlet exciton. The spectrum of the 0.05 mM TIPS-Pn solution appears to maintain its shape over time. Figure 1(b) shows the averaged spectrum over early times (50-150 ps), and late times (7500-8000 ps), normalized to the GSB. The shape is essentially identical for both time windows, suggesting that predominantly singlet excitons are present over the full 8 ns window, and there is insignificant triplet formation. The kinetics at all wavelengths fit well to a single exponential decay with a lifetime of 18.1 ± 0.2 ns (Fig. and Sec. S4.1 of the supplementary material). A small deviation is present at very early times (<50 ps), which we attribute to solvent reorganization. 17 Previously reported lifetimes of TIPS-Pn singlet excitons vary from around 12 to 22 ns, with this range of values likely due to the presence of additional deactivation pathways in some of these measurements through reactions with oxygen. ', 'IV. CONCLUSIONSUsing transient absorption spectroscopy of 0.05 mM and 8 mM solutions of TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn in toluene, we have quantified an upper bound on the rate constant (lower bound on the time constant) of intersystem crossing (ISC) in these solutions as 3.08 × 10 6 s -1 (325 ns) and 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 (118 ns), respectively. Taking the ISC rate constants into account, we were also able to quantify the bimolecular singlet fission (SF) rate constants in these solutions as (2.6 ± 0.7) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 for TIPS-Pn, and (2.3 ± 0.9) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 for TIPS-Tn, where the range of values comes from the uncertainty in the ISC rate constant and in the T 1 basis spectra. We have pointed out some discrepancies in the literature, and shown that ISC can be overestimated by disregarding diffusion-limited SF in dilute solutions. Alternatively, SF can also be overestimated by not appropriately considering T 1 contributions from ISC. For systems in which SF is relatively slow, or is limited by diffusion through solution or exciton diffusion through a disordered material, the effect of ISC is particularly important. To make progress in the implementation of SF in photovoltaic devices (or in fact in other applications, such as quantum computing), it is important to accurately identify and quantify SF rate constants and yields, which would be impossible in many circumstances if ISC is not also considered.FIG. 1 .1FIG. 1.

As with TIPS-Pn, the averaged and normalized 0.05 mM TA data show minimal shape change over 8 ns (Fig. )), indicating that this spectrum predominantly contains singlet excitons, with minimal SF, ISC, or excimer formation. The decay of the spectrum fits well to a single exponential with a 12.7 ± 0.2 ns time constant (Sec. S5.1 of the supplementary material). This time constant is reasonably consistent with the 13.2 ns singlet lifetime of TIPS-Tn in anhydrous toluene previously reported by and the 11.6 ns lifetime in chloroform reported by In contrast, the 8 mM TIPS-Tn TA spectrum shows some shape change over time (Fig. ).The difference is less prominent than for TIPS-Pn, but there is a clear emergence of a peak at ∼510 nm, concurrent with decreases in the amplitudes of S 1 features (relative to the GSB). We assign this peak to the absorbance of TIPS-Tn triplet excitons, consistent with the visible T 1 absorbance of other tetracene derivatives. Again, since no significant triplet formation was observed in the dilute TIPS-Tn solution, this triplet formation in the more concentrated solution must be due to SF.', 'target=""#b7"">8 Given the solubility of TIPS-Pn in toluene is similar to chloroform, we expect that aggregation was absent in the solutions studied here.For TIPS-Tn, the singlet decay rate constant, k S 1 , was fixed to 1/12.7 ns -1 (taken from the relaxation lifetime of the singlet excited state in the dilute solution in Sec. S4.1 of the supplementary material) minus the ISC and SF contributions (k ISC and k SF × 0.05 mM). The triplet decay rate constant was fixed to 1/80 µs -1 , taken from the lifetime used by Dover et al.. Again, the triplet lifetime is substantially longer than the timescales measured here, and has little effect on the fit.The resulting kinetic model fits are shown in Fig. , where again the shaded gray region represents the range of possible kinetics that fit the triplet concentration. This model is able to capture the behavior of TIPS-Tn reasonably well. The triplet formation kinetics are reproduced well, and the singlet decay has some small discrepancies, which, as with TIPS-Pn, we attribute to solvent reorganization or the presence of some additional S 1 deactivation pathways.

It provides a basis for the quantum mechanical applications of information theory.How can one determine the state of the system leading to events that are most probable and therefore reproducible by repeated experiments? The maximal entropy approach seeks to reconstruct the density matrix of the system in its most probable state in a situation of incomplete knowledge, when only partial information about the system is available. The commonly discussed scenario is when we know N mean values for a set of operators typically called the constraints. In general this set of expectation values is not sufficient to uniquely determine the state. Among all density operators that are consistent with the given mean values of the constraints we select the one (unique) density of whose entropy is maximal.This density operator is represented as an exponential function of those operators whose mean values are given. For this density matrix, the surprisal is a linear function of the operators that are the constraints with coefficients that are the Lagrange multipliers that arise in seeking a maximum of the entropy subject to constraints. The linearity of the surprisal as a function of the constraints is especially convenient when the operators do not commute and an exponential form in the operators calls for special handling, e.g., Ref. 22.An established route for the computation of the dynamical evolution of the surprisal is via an algebraic procedure for the dynamics of the constraints in the Heisenberg picture.

CONCLUDING REMARKSSurprisal analysis of experimental distributions in physics, chemistry and biology can often be characterized even by a single dominant constraint. A very recent example is the analysis of COVID19 patient gene expression samples to identify a single constraint, a gene module, that strongly aligns with disease severity. In the present work we develop an approach that allows to extract the dominant constraints for different scenarios of the coherent quantum dynamics on multiple electronic states. We show that such an approximate but compact treatment of the density provides good accuracy for both electronic and vibrational population and coherence dynamics.A density operator that is an exponential function of the constraints is a central result of the maximal entropy formalism. It follows that the surprisal, the logarithm of the density, is then a linear function of the operators of the constraints. The linearity allows a ready analysis of the importance of each constraint in the description of the density, in contrast to the density operator which is an exponential function of the not necessarily commuting constraints. In practice the expansion of the surprisal is analogous to the computation of the coefficients of the linear expansion of a function in an orthonormal basis set, with the key difference that here instead of the functions in Hilbert space we use operators as basis vectors in Liouville space.By direct propagation of the surprisal we obtain the matrix of the surprisal at different times of the dynamics. It is a general procedure and allows describing dynamics for any type of the potential and interstate coupling. We then evaluate the Lagrange multipliers -the coefficients of the chosen set of constraints, using the orthogonality relations established for this set of operators. We discuss both the cases when the algebra is', 'it can only cover a finite time interval. A coupling of the system to its environment can also be described by the Lie algebraic technique that we use but such an application of the surprisal as an exact numerical tool remain to be implemented in detail.We develop an approach where the time-evolution of a quantum system is provided through the surprisal of the density matrix, . The propagation of the surprisal in time is described by the same evolution operator as the propagation of the density matrix. We also seek to make a bridge to empirical surprisal analysis. In these practical applications approximate compact representations of the surprisal were usefully applied to characterize dominant behavior patterns in complex systems. The characterization of a system using the logarithm of its probability distribution was pioneered already by Gibbs and Boltzmann. The statistical notion of entropy was introduced by Boltzmann as a logarithmic measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied. Gibbs described the properties of the canonical ensemble showing that it is characterized by the minimum of \'-entropy\'. The quantum mechanical foundations of these thermodynamic ideas are given in detail in chapter V of Ref. 15 and are discussed critically by Already in the Boltzmann\'s ""method of the most probable distribution"" one can identify the main idea that accompanied surprisal along its historical path -the idea of asking only questions about properties of the system that are reproducible in many experimental replications. The connection to information theory can be made by special reference to the first coding theorem of Shannon. The quantum mechanical analog of the coding theorem is by ˆÎ lnr = -Schumacher. It', 'B. Expansion of the surprisal via a finite set of constraintsWe discuss three different motivations for representing the density as an exponential function of a sum of operators and determine a condition under which the three representations are equivalent and when they are dynamically exact. The simplest to state is an inference of the density matrix at time t by the maximum entropy formalism. We seek the density that is of maximal entropy given the constraint that the density is normalized and is consistent with the mean values of Hermitian observables indexed by k. It is convenient to include a k = 0 term as the condition of normalization, or .In the specific example of a thermal state, the mean energy of the system, , plays a role of the only constraint, besides normalization.

( <ref', 'two other derivations of a density matrix that also are of an exponential form like Eq. ( ) but where the motivation is tightly connected to the dynamics. In a theoretical or computational discussion, one often initiates the dynamics from a pure state. But in reality, the initial state is often a mixture and then it makes sense to start from an initial density of maximal entropy subject to those constraints that govern the yet unperturbed state,. For such an initial state we now show that the exact time evolution of the density or of the surprisal is described with a finite number of time-dependent constraints with time independent Lagrange multipliers. The proof requires the unitarity of the time evolution operator and a series expansion of the exponential:(The time-dependent constraints are the terms in the curly brackets, and there are as many time-dependent constraints as the number of constraints in the initial state. In section III we discuss how to compute directly the surprisal:The method of computing the surprisal can also be applied should we wish to obtain explicit expressions for the individual time-dependent constraints.We next come to a simpler but more specialized result. It is valid for the special case when the dynamics of the constraints are closed under commutation relation with the Hamiltonian.In such a limiting situation the exact time evolution can be described with a finite number of time-independent constraints but with time dependent Lagrange multipliers with known equations of motion.

This approximate treatment follows the spirit of the information theory approach -description of the density matrix using only a partial but essential knowledge about the system.To discuss systems with more than a few degrees of freedom a large basis is needed for numerical convergence. So exact propagation of the surprisal on a finite basis will be computationally demanding. However, the dynamics of the Lagrange multipliers of the dominant constraints may be sufficient for most purposes. This opens a different way of approximating the quantum dynamics in many-body systems, a subject for future research.In section II we show that if the initial state of a system is described as a state of maximal entropy, a finite set of time-dependent constraints is sufficient to reproduce the surprisal at all subsequent times. During a unitary time-evolution the rank of the density matrix is conserved so the number of the time-dependent constraints is the same as the number of constraints on the initial state. In section II we further describe the special circumstances where an algebraically delineated finite set of time-independent constraints is sufficient to describe the dynamics. The algebraic procedure to convert the dynamics of the surprisal to a compact evolution of the Lagrange multipliers is introduced. Section III discusses the proposed computational scheme for an exact dynamical evolution of the surprisal in a finite dimensional space.

This approach combines the spiroketal forming step with a fragment coupling utilizing ortholactones as double electrophiles with silyloxyallylsilanes. We also discoved a rapid and regioselective isomerization of the exocyclic sprioketals to their endo-cyclic forms.Spiroketals are an important functional group in many natural products that possess potent medicinal properties. 1 As a result, they have increasingly become targets of interest by the pharmaceutical industry, 2 with ivermectin, 3 and tofogliflozin licensed as therapeutics (Scheme 1A). In many cases, the barrier to advancing the clinical development of complex spirocyclic natural products, such as the spongistatins, 5 is the availability of compound from either natural or synthetic sources. As a result, new modular and convergent methods for spiroketal formations are needed.

Due to the Isomerization that was observed in the reaction of 1k, we investigated the origin of this with different substrates. With the parent benzofused spiroketal 3e, we examined whether isomerization occurred through prolonged reaction times in the spiroketalization step. Extended reaction times and substoichiometric amounts of TMSOTf, however led to slow and unselective isomerization, alongside extensive decomposition. Interestingly, when we resubjected the spiroketals to TMSOTf in chlorobenzene, a very rapid and highly selective migration of the alkene was observed to provide the Δ 2,3 isomer as the only observable product.

We embarked on a research program to develop a convergent strategy whereby the spiroketalization step is also the fragment coupling step. Such an approach could lead to streamlined synthetic routes and facile structural diversification through the development of a more convergent approach. Specifically, we reasoned that ortholactones 1 could be used as bimodal electrophiles, reacting with bis-nucleophilic silyloxy allylsilanes 2 under acidic conditions to directly form a spiroketal group (Scheme 1C). This research was inspired by Markó's reports that unsubstituted ortholactones could react with silyloxyallylsilanes to form spiroketals (Scheme 1D). The ortholactones they utilized were formed via a strongly alkylative process from δ-valerolactone or γ-butyrolactone, however this reaction is neither functional group tolerant nor general (Scheme 1E). To circumvent these issues, we have developed a palladium catalyzed aerobic Wacker-type reaction of functionalized dihydropyrans and have demonstrated their reactivity towards in situ generated TfOH. The synthesis of benzofused ortholactones can be achieved using orthoquinone methine and electrocyclization techniques. We began examining the reaction of D-glucal derived ortholactone 1a with the simple silyloxyallyl silane 2a.

Related systems reported by Markó observed significant amounts of unselective exo-to endo-isomerization in the absence of an alkoxysilane or low temperatures. This was proposed to be caused by adventitious TfOH protonating the exocyclic alkene leading to a thermodynamic mixture of endoisomers. To investigate this isomerization further, DFT studies were conducted to find the ground-state energies of possible intermediates (Scheme 4). The ground-state energies of the exocyclic (3e), the Δ 2,3 endocyclic (4e) and the Δ 3,4 isomer (5e) were calculated and the two endocyclic isomers (4e and 5e) were found to be within 0.2 kcal/mol with the exocyclic alkene is 3.2 kcal/mol less stable. These results highlight that although the endocyclic isomer is favoured, little if any selectivity would be observed at equilibrium. Additionally, the energy of the protonated alkene intermediate 6e was prohibitively high (+41.4 kcal/mol). We therefore examined a Lewis acid mediated pathway that proceeds via binding to the phenolic oxygen and ring opening. The ensuing oxocarbenium ion 7e (+25.4 kcal/mol) can undergo a triflate mediated isomerization to form the conjugated Δ 2,3 isomer 8e (+10.2 kcal/mol) before ring closure and TMS release to form 4e (-3.2 kcal/mol).

Modulation of the solvent showed that many non-polar or etherial solvents provided similar results, while MeCN led to extensive decomposition and an intractable mixture of products. PhCl and PhCF3 provided the best reactivity, with the former providing a single regioisomer. Further optimization of the reaction in both solvents found a significant concentration effect with 0.025M in PhCF3 (Table , Entry 10) affording a single exo-cyclic product in 72% isolated yield. With the optimized conditions in hand, we examined the substrate scope with both carbohydrate and benzannulated ortholactones 1. With carbohydrate derived ortholactones (1a-1d), we found that good yields of the spiroketal coupled products were achieved when C-5 substitution was present. Indeed, spiroketals with CH2OAc (3a), methyl esters (3b) and CH3 groups (3c) could be formed with high chemical efficiency. Xylal derived ortholactone (1d) provided the spiroketal product (3d) in more moderate yield, likely due to the decreased stability of the ortholactone starting material (1d). When benzannulated ortholactones (1e-1k) were utilized, good to excellent reactivity was observed with high yields of the spiroketal product (3e-3j) being obtained. Ortholactones containing phenyl (1e) and 1-napthyl (1f) were particularly efficient with the corresponding spiroketal being isolated in 87% and 90% yields, respectively. Further substitution could be tolerated with both bromo (3g-3i) and methoxy (3h) spiroketals being produced, alongside the thymol derived analog 3j.

Genetic algorithms are a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics in biological systems . They proceed via an iterative process involving a population of candidate solutions that undergo recombination and mutation to create new offspring solutions. A selection process based on the fitness of each solution, or model, is used to determine which solutions survive into the next generation. Just as evolutionary pressures are the primary driver for shaping the evolution of organisms, the metric used to determine each candidate model\'s ability to survive selection and go on to participate in breeding the next generation of models is of central importance to shaping the evolution of candidate models in a genetic algorithm. Since the goal is to discover network Hamiltonian models that can maximally and reliably simulate the self-assembly of amyloid fibril network structures, we define a metric for amyloid fibril production called fibril fraction , which is defined simply as the number of nodes in the system that make up part of a region of perfect amyloid fibril divided by the total number of nodes in the simulation (e.g. in Figure ).

Indeed, materials presenting pore blocking effects are characterized by having pores interconnected through channels with a medium size; while materials that exhibit cavitation have narrow channels that interconnect their pores, see Figure .

Therefore, the synthesized materials possessed micropores and mesopores . Hysteresis loops provide information related to the distribution, shape, and connectivity of mesopores . All materials exhibited H2 type hysteresis (see Figure ). For these loops, the samples exhibited a plateau at the desorption branch which (see arrow 1) surpassed the plateau recorded for the adsorption branch of the loop. Such behavior is characteristic of a hindered evaporation process and is usually interpreted as if narrow connections between pores block the transit of the evaporated probe molecule through the porous network of the material . Results show that the latter trend increased with the concentration of the modulator; i.e., larger plateaus were found with the decrease in the concentration of acetic acid, Figure . Besides this trend, the decrease in the concentration of the modulator also seemed to alter the mesoporous network of the material up to a point where cavitation takes place . This is suggested by the apparition of a step followed by an abrupt drop in the amount of the adsorbed probe in the hysteresis loop at lower relative pressures; ca. 0.4-0.42 and ca. 0.49-0.44 for argon at 87.3K and nitrogen at 77.4K,"", 'the calculated pore size distributions with those for the surface areas of the microporous structure of the materials, surface 1 was ascribed to the family of pores with an average size of 0.58 nm, while surface 2 was assumed to represent the family of micropores measuring 1.53 nm.

This trend resembles the one found before for the relative mesopores to micropores surface areas. Therefore, it seems that there is a critical concentration of organic modulator that promotes the formation of Zr-MOFs structures with larger pores in both the micro and mesoporous size ranges. The ensemble of the results presented in this section agrees with literature reports , showing that the modulator serves to control the porosity of Zr-MOFs. However, as far as we know, these reports have not explored the role of the concentration of the organic modulator as presented herein. In this sense, one of the contributions of this work was establishing how the concentration of an organic modulator alters the porosity and surface area of Zr-MOFs of the 808 type in particular ways.', 'Assessment of the effect of sulfation on surface area and porosityThe argon adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding \uf063-plots for ZrBTC-114.6 and ZrBTC-114.6-S are shown in Figure . After PSM, the isotherm of the material changed. The hysteresis loop became most like a type H4 one [65] , in which the adsorption branch resembles a combination of Types I and II isotherms and the lower limit of the desorption branch is usually located at the cavitation-induced relative pressure. This behavior suggests that mesopores became clogged by sulfate groups hence inducing pore blocking and cavitation effects. Furthermore, the pore size distribution, Figure , of ZrBTC-114.6-S was starkly different from the one calculated for ZrBTC-114.6. Particularly, mesopores were enlarged while the family of micropores with an average size of 1.53 nm disappeared. These trends were consistent with the surface areas calculated through the χ-method, Table . Indeed, the total surface area of the PSM MOF decreased ca. 33 % (SAχ = 704 m 2 /g) as compared to ZrBTC-114.6 (SAχ = 1050 m 2 /g). Furthermore, the surface area corresponding to microporous from the family with an average size of 1.53 nm amounted to zero whereas the mesoporous surface area dropped ca. 83%. Also, the total pore volume exhibited a reduction of ca. ca. 54 % after PSM. These results suggest that, on the one hand, sulfate ions are hindered from entering ultramicopores in Zr-MOFs and that, on the other hand, the families of pores corresponding to the largest micropores and the mesopores of the synthesized MOFs are not connected to the ultramicropores of the materials. The latter proposal is partly supported by the fact that PSM did not change the surface area of the ultramicropores. Scheme 1 represents the above', 'ConclusionsThis study analyzed the effect of varying the concentration of acetic acid used as modulator during the synthesis of defective Zr-MOFs of the MOF-808 type. The main key findings in this regard were: (i) all the synthesized materials displayed a certain degree of amorphicity related to the formation of a mesoporous structure. (ii) Increasing the concentration of the employed modulator promoted the formation of a more crystalline structure without affecting the thermal stability of the material. At the same time, the porous structure of the materials was also modified as a function of the concentration of the modulator. Particularly, wider and more numerous mesopores were formed at the highest acetic acid concentration without affecting the relative proportion between the two families of micropores belonging to the inner structure of the material. (iii) Evidence suggests that the activation stage of the materials synthesis encompasses the removal of adsorbed water and organic linkers replaced by molecules of the modulator was found. On the other hand, an analysis of the effects produced by performing a conventional post-synthetic modification with sulfuric acid of a selected sample from the synthesized defective Zr-MOFs led to conclude the following: (i) sulfuric acid chemically attack the surface structure of the defective Zr-MOF leading to a sulfation of the Zr moieties and to a sulfonation of the organic functional groups besides of depositing residual sulfate ions on the surface. (ii) The attack performed by sulfuric acid enhanced the thermal stability of the Zr-MOF, but it degraded its porous and crystalline structure. Concerning the former, the collected evidence for the PSM treated Zr-MOF suggested that only the families of mesopores and the larger micropores are interconnected within the material. Therefore, the ultramicropores in the defective Zr-MOF seemed isolated from the rest of', 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b68"">[69] reported a type I isotherm; i.e., no mesopores were found, for a MOF-808 synthesized with the same Zr metallic precursor employed herein and using formic acid as the modulator, instead. Comparing these reports to our work, not only a strong influence of the nature of the modulator on the porous structure of Zr-MOFs is evidenced, but also the role of the concentration of a given modulator takes a central stage in controlling this property as well. The characteristics of the recorded isotherms show that the synthesized Zr-MOFs are micro/mesoporous materials whose pore network is affected by the concentration of the acetic acid modulator. The lower the concentration of the latter, the more complex the corresponding porous network becomes. Such a complexity seems to be related to the formation of narrow necks interconnecting the mesopores. The narrowness of these necks seemed to increase with the decrease of the acetic acid modulator concentration. According to calculations, the synthesized materials possess various families of pores whose distributions are reflected in the corresponding stepwise cumulative pore volume curves, See Figure . Particularly, ZrBTC-52.4, Figure , showed three different families of micropores. The average sizes of these families were ca.: 0.58, 0.88, and 1.53 nm. Among them, the one whose average size was 0.88 nm represented the lowest increase in cumulative pore volume. Furthermore, such a family of pores tended to disappear with the increase in the concentration of the modulator. Concerning mesopores, the increase in the concentration of the modulator led to displacement and widening of the pore size distributions in this range.

For AC simulations, however, the numbers of defects left at 10 ps are much less. This demonstrates the deficiency of the AC method in the simulation of DD generation. The AC method can only partition the system according to geometrical criteria. With the AC method, the collision of atoms is treated with the higher-level method only after atoms are very close to each other, and is treated with the lowerlevel method when atoms are not close enough (Fig. ), so the description of the collision process is inconsistent.

Fig. confirms this as the curves of AC/SDAC simulations are close to the Tersoff/ZBL curve for the first 0.1 ps. After 0.1 ps, the dynamics is described by the \'lower-level\' SW potential in the AC simulations and the SDAC simulation without transition forces, and the curves of these simulations in Fig. slowly deviate from the Tersoff/ZBL curve.Due to the unphysical heating of the buffer region by transition forces, the QM/buffer regions of the SDAC simulation with transition forces does not vanish until about 6.3 ps. The deviation of the ξ', ""ConclusionIn this paper, I extend the AC method of my previous work and develop an SDAC method to allow the active region centers in AP-QM/MM simulations to be determined on-the-fly according to speed-dependent properties, and I validate and demonstrate the method by applying it on the AP-MM/MM and AP-QM/MM simulations of the DD generation in bulk Si. AP-MM/MM simulations show that the SDAC method improves over the previous AC method, since the SDAC dynamics, number of defects, and the shape of the disordered region agrees better with those of the 'higherlevel' MM method than the AC results. Although the motivation for developing the SDAC method is for the simulation of the DD generation, the method is applicable to general problems in which active regions may occur or vanish during the simulation and have a speed dependence, such as the dynamics of shockwaves or collisions.The SDAC PES is speed-dependent, and the usual EOM in MD becomes inapplicable. I develop an energy-conserving SDAC EOM, which is different from Newton's second law by the SDEM term. The time integration of the non-standard EOM is carried out with the EPS algorithm. The dynamics of the SDAC QM/MM system can be expected to be close to that of the real system when the SDEM is much smaller than atomic masses. I show that the size of the SDEM can be effectively tuned by the functional form of the SDAC criterion property, which allows the SDAC method to be applicable in general systems.The transition forces in AP-QM/MM lead to geometry distortions and artificial heating. The same effect is observed in the SDAC simulations, and is found to be significant when the higher-level and lower-level methods of QM/MM differ a lot. I find that discarding the transition forces"", ""active regions. Fig. (a) agrees with this analysis: the difference between the SW and the Tersoff/ZBL curves can be seen clearly during 0.01∼0.025 ps and during 0.1∼1 ps, and both the AC and the SDAC curves in these durations follow the SW curve closely as expected. The maximum speeds of all atoms are plotted in Fig. . The difference between the SW and the Tersoff/ZBL curves is the most obvious during 0.008∼0.07 ps. Since the regions around fastmoving atoms are active regions in the SDAC simulation, the SDAC curve is close to the 'higherlevel' Tersoff/ZBL curve in this time duration, and the degree of the agreement between these curves indicate the quality of the adaptively determined partition of the system. The AC curve also follows the trend of the Tersoff/ZBL curve, since the fast-moving atoms about to collide with other atoms are also identified as active region centers. Fig. (c) plots the number of QM/buffer atoms. The QM/buffer regions of the AC simulation vanish at about 0.1 ps, but those of the SDAC simulation continue to exist until about 6.3 ps, and the number of QM/buffer atoms oscillates rapidly. This is an artifact due to the inclusion of the transition forces of Eq. ( ). The transition forces lead to an artificial heating of the buffer region, which affects the speed of the active region center through the interactions with the buffer atoms. The overall effect is that ξ full of the active region center does not drop below ξ semi min for a long time. The heating of the buffer region also exists for the AC simulation, but the effect is not as significant since its criterion does not depend on the speed. The small peak at about 6.3 ps in the SDAC curve of Fig. ) is also due to the artificial heating by transition forces.As"", 'target=""#fig_7"">6(b) is also due to the artificial heating by transition forces.As mentioned before, Hamiltonian corrections to transition forces are unavailable for the mod-SISPA AP-QM/MM method used in this paper. Pezeshki et al suggested that the transition forces should be discarded directly to avoid the geometry distortion and the artificial heating, and the system is coupled to a thermostat since the energy is no longer conserved. The results of the corresponding AC and SDAC simulations without transition forces are plotted in Fig. ). The difference between Fig. ) and (f) confirms that the long tail of the SDAC curve is due to transition forces. The heating of the buffer region is also evident by comparing the curves of Fig. (a) and (d) during 0.01∼0.02 ps. Without the transition forces, the SDAC max speed curve in Fig. (e) has a much better agreement with the \'higher-level\' Tersoff/ZBL curve in the 0.008∼0.07 ps time duration than the curve in Fig. .Amorphous disordered regions form in the D-D generation process.

The aspect ratios dx / dy and dx / dz in Fig. characterize the morphology of the disordered region.At 0.15 ps, the front view of the disordered region of the SW simulation has a roughly elliptical shape which is rotated clockwise, and that of the Tersoff/ZBL simulation is roughly wedge-shaped with the narrow side pointing bottom left. The SW one is also larger in size and more extended in the x direction comparing with that of the Ter- showing that the AC and SDAC methods are able to correctly identify the active regions of the DD process and apply the 'higher-level' Tersoff/ZBL potential to these regions. At 10 ps, most of the damage in the SW simulation is healed, and remaining disordered atoms are grouped in several smaller clusters with similar sizes. In the Tersoff/ZBL simulation, a large number of disordered atoms remains, and most of them belong to a large cluster. The dynamics of the annealing process for all AC/SDAC simulations is determined by the SW potential, but the resulting stabilized disordered regions have very different shapes. The AC simulations end up with very few disordered atoms and does not resemble the results of both the SW and the Tersoff/ZBL simulations. For the SDAC simulations, the numbers of disordered atoms at 10 ps are almost the same as that of the SW simulation according to Fig. , but the geometry of the disordered region retains some of the characters of that of the Tersoff/ZBL simulation, since the disordered atoms are mostly gathered in a large cluster.""]","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Unclassified']",221,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.98442270999803,0.6725127330127814,"['at', 'what', 'temperature']"

The B3LYP functional gives weaker binding energies than the CCSD(T) benchmarks, and prior work by Zhang et al. suggested that this under-binding becomes more pronounced with increasing molecular size. As such, B3LYP will incur significant errors for the large periodic strands, as we demonstrate in the next section. Based on these benchmark calculations, the B3LYP-D functional most closely matches the CCSD(T) results, particularly for the van-der-Waalsstacked monomers. In contrast, both the BLYP and B3LYP functionals produce geometries that are highly distorted in which the individual Watson-Crick base pairs are not even aligned in the same plane. A frequency analysis can give further information on structural stability; however, geometry optimizations of these large, periodic systems were already computationally expensive (requiring hundreds of thousands of CPU hours), and frequency calculations were out of reach for these structures. For this reason, we only present the structures in Figure , which clearly depict the base pairs to be misaligned with each other to depict the distortions/instabilities in these structures. The structural deformations in these periodic strands are fully consistent with the benchmark calculations described in the previous section.

In particular, the S22 set contains several DNA nucleobase monomers (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine), stacked pair geometries (adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine), and a canonical Watson-Crick base pair (adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine) calculated at a complete-basis-set-extrapolated CCSD(T) level of theory.

It is worth noting that while dispersion corrections give more accurate geometries, they do not address known limitations of B3LYP for long-range charge transfer/transport, particularly in molecular systems. For the same reason, even though the B3LYP-D interaction energies give the best agreement with the CCSD(T) benchmarks in this study, the electronic couplings involved in the rates of charge transfer/transport in these systems can still incur large errors.

However, it is important to mention that the goal of our current study is not to resolve open issues on charge-transport mechanisms in DNA. Rather, the largescale calculations presented in this work can serve as new reference benchmarks that are expected to be more accurate than the semilocal or Hartree-Fock calculations discussed previously. Most notably, the B3LYP-D calculations in this work represent one of the first studies of periodic DNA and nucleobase structures using dispersion-corrected hybrid functionals for both full geometry optimizations and electronic band structures. Using these optimized geometries and band structures, we present electron/hole mobilities for various single-and double-strand DNA structures.

The newly proposed Δ-machine learning approach is efficient to obtain high-level energies for a large number of points.Indeed, the newly proposed approach is, to some extent, similar to the composite approach proposed and developed by Pople and other pioneering theorists. The chemical accuracy can be efficiently reached at the computationally cost of combinations of these models. Briefly, the target high-level energy can be obtained by adding various corrections, which were crafted to determine efficiently,1 2 1 HL LL IL LL IL IL HL IL i E E E E E - - - = +  +  + + (2)with LL for low level, ILi for the intermediate level i, and HL for target high level. Given an appropriate low-level calculation, the problem then becomes how to determine accurate and efficient estimation for ΔEs. Consequently, one can determine the energies for a large number of configurations efficiently within the hierarchy scheme. Further, one can improve previous PESs by adding more and more corrections gradually, which is invaluable for the science community of developing PESs and related fields.However, how to efficiently sample points from the low-level dataset is a key issue, as the computational cost is directly determined by the sampling size. Therefore, we propose in this work an NN-based Δ-machine learning approach for developing full-dimensional accurate PES.

To test the effectiveness of this approach, we construct the first accurate fulldimensional ground triplet state PES for the HO2 + HO2 → H2O2 + O2 reaction. Finally, only about 14% (10700) of the DFT data points (75300) are used to accurately bring the DFT PES of this system to UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ level. This newly fitted PIP-NN based Δ-machine learning approach will be used to build PESs of larger systems in our future work. Note, other NN approaches can be also used to replace PIP-NN to train the correction PES.Based on the newly fitted PES, the QCT calculations are carried out to study the dynamics of the title reaction. We find a special mode-specificity dynamics, namely, exciting the spectator HO stretch mode of HOO' can significantly enhance the reactivity of the title reaction at low collision energy, which was first reported in our previous work of the OH + HO2 → H2O + O2 reaction. Unlike the conventional mode specificity, this special mechanism can be attributed to increased attraction potential caused by the excited OH. As pointed out earlier by us, such special mode specificity effect may be prevalent in combustion and atmospheric reactions. More interesting dynamics will be expected in various complicated reactions once their full-dimensional accurate PESs are developed, for instance, by the present efficient approach.PIP-NN based Δ-ML method. For the PES of the title system, the first step is to construct a low-level DFT PES at the selected UM06-2X/AVTZ level. Developing PESs of reactive systems has been detailed in our previous work, and thus is not repeated here. Overall, the PES was gradually improved until all relevant dynamical results were converged and key properties, including geometries,"", 'UCCSD(T)/AVQZ method. Then they reduced grid density on every coordinate by roughly a factor of 2. Consequently, 1400 points were chosen from 15000 symmetry-unique points and were computed at the high-accuracy UCCSD(T)/AV5Z method. The cubic spline method was used to construct both VLL and ΔVHL-LL. Similarly, the Δ-machine learning (ML) approach seeks to add a correction, defined as the difference between high-level and low-level calculation, to some properties (not only limited to the PES) obtained at a low-level and efficient method. Transfer learning (TL) relies on the fact that knowledge gained from solving a related problem can be used to solve an unknown problem. TL is valuable to bypass the high computational cost of high-level (generally, the higher, the more accurate) electronic structure calculations. For developing PESs, a large number of low-level data (efficient to obtain) is used to first optimize a pre-trained neural network (NN), which can then be refined by a smaller number of high-level data. Most TL and Δ-ML studies focused on developing general transferable force fields for thermochemistry and for molecular dynamics simulations at room temperatures or so. In these cases, only regions around the equilibrium need be considered.For example, Meuwly and coworkers employed the TL approach to improve a low-level MP2 NN PESs for malonaldehyde, acetoacetaldehyde, and acetylacetone (AcAc) to a high level of theory using the pair natural orbitals (PNO)-LCCSD(T)-F12 method. The resulting PESs were successfully', 'and many other properties. Thanks to the advance in computing power and quantum chemistry, it is now possible to carry out ab initio calculations at the ""gold standard"" CCSD(T) (or MRCI) level for tens to hundreds of thousands of configurations for complicated systems of reasonable size. Recent years have witnessed great success in developing high-fidelity potential energy surfaces (PESs) by the machine-learning methods, such as the permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP), the neural network (NN), or their combination PIP-NN, nonredundant PIP-NN, and fundamental invariant (FI)-NN. Thanks to the universal approximator NN, the use of the PIPs, nonredundant PIPs, or FIs as the NN input can guarantee not only the high fidelity but also the rigorous symmetry property of the molecular system with respect to the permutation of like atoms. Recent reported examples include F/Cl/H + CH3OH, OH +CH4, etc., for each more than 100000 UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ energies were computed. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) is generally smaller than 0.23 kcal mol -1 (10 meV), namely, well within the highly coveted chemical accuracy, 1 kcal mol -1 . V V V - = + \uf044(1)Thus, calculation cost can be significantly saved. For the F + H2 reaction, they sampled 15000 symmetry-unique points by a grid approach and calculated their energies by the low-accuracy UCCSD(T)/AVQZ method. Then they reduced grid density on every coordinate by roughly a factor of 2.', 'ΔVHL-LL, based on a much smaller dataset, is employed to predict the energies of the remaining points used in VLL. This is due to that ΔVHL-LL spans a very small energy range and shows a ""flat topography"".Then for each point in the dynamically relevant configuration space, ΔVHL-LL can be used to bring its potential energy to a target high level from efficient low-level calculations. Finally, these points with high-level energies are used to fit the final PES, which is again expressed as a single PIP-NN function, resulting an efficient evaluation of the PES during dynamics simulations. Essentially, this new Δ-ML approach is used to efficiently obtain the high-level energies for a large number of configurations.The new PIP-NN based Δ-ML approach is used to develop the globally accurate fulldimensional (12D) PES of the self-reaction of HO2 (HO2 + HO2) at the leading triplet electronic state. The PES of the bimolecular reaction HO2 + HO2 covers much wide ranges in both energy and configuration spaces. Both the asymptotic and the strongly interacting regions need be well described as the scattering results are highly sensitive to the details of the PES, particularly for the title reaction, for which its reactant channel is complicated by the long-range interaction and its leading transition state (TS) is submerged.Ab initio calculations. The reaction profile of the title reaction is illustrated in Figure . The corresponding structural parameters and harmonic frequencies of the stationary points are provided in Figure and Table , respectively. In general, the current calculations are consistent with the recent high-level theoretical results, but apparent discrepancies do exist for TS1, as discussed below.There are two different pathways from the reactants HO2 + HO2 to the same products H2O2 + O2. One first forms the oxywater (H2OO)', 'The potential energy surface (PES) plays a central role in chemistry. As the size of the reaction system increases, it would be more and more difficult to develop its globally accurate full-dimensional PES. One unavoidable difficulty is that it is too expensive to calculate electronic energies of ample configurations for complicated reactions. Δ-machine learning, or the hierarchical construction scheme is a highly cost-effective method as only a small number of highlevel ab initio energies are required to improve a potential energy surface (PES) fit to a large number of low-level points. Based on this idea, we propose a permutation-invariant-polynomial neural-network (PIP-NN)-based Δ-machine learning approach to construct full-dimensional accurate PESs of complicated reactions efficiently. Particularly, the high flexibility of the NN is exploited to efficiently sample points from the low-level dataset, which is very useful for the large 2 systems with large configuration space. The approach is applied to the HO2 + HO2 → H2O2 + O2 reaction, a key process in combustion and atmosphere. The full-dimensional triplet state PES is first constructed with a large number of density functional theory (DFT) points, which cover all dynamically relevant regions. Only 14% of the DFT dataset are used to successfully bring the DFT PES to the UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ quality. On this PES of high quality, quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations are performed to study the dynamics of the title reaction. A surprising modespecific dynamics is observed, in which exciting a spectator mode leads to significant enhancement of the reactivity at low collision energy. This special mechanism can be attributed to increased attraction potential caused by the excited spectator mode. Such mode specificity may be quite prevalent in free radical reactions involving HO2, which is common in combustion and atmosphere.']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Unclassified']",657,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9344664206323176,0.4883774258469082,"['which', 'method', 'the']"

Since the number of state vectors (= the number of variational parameters) that construct the vector subspace is considerably smaller than that of the entire Hilbert space, the variational approach with the Davidson formalism helps to circumvent barren plateaus phenomenon .In practical applications, we need to preserve the spin-symmetry and ensure the orthonormality between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in the course of the minimization process.To achieve this, we generalize the spin-restricted form of the Gray code circuit with minor modifications of the scheme introduced in the previous section. To illustrate this, let us examine the H 2 /STO-3G system, which corresponds to Eq. ( ), and try to find the S 1 state variationally. The Gray code scheme for the non-variational approach in the previous section creates the desired quantum superposition by connecting the fixed reference state with the target excited Slater determinant at a time. In this way, one introduces parameters to both reference and target configurations at each operation. There is no direct connection between excited configurations, which have to be spin-adapted, e.g., between |0110⟩ and |1001⟩ of Eq. ( ).

The number of matrix elements to measure on quantum computers and the dimension of the matrix to diagonalize on classical computers depend on the level of correlation treatment and the one-electron basis set. By restricting the excitation levels to singles and doubles, the quantum computer is required to measure about N ∼ n occ × n vir + n 2 occ × n 2 vir matrix elements and the classical computer is required to diagonalize N × N matrix, which scales as O(N 3 ). Although the dimension of the matrix M can considerably be reduced by utilizing the sparsity and symmetries of the Hamiltonian, the scaling quickly reaches the intractable regime as the system size increases.Eqs. ( ) and (22), which are the working equation of qEOM with the self-consistent manifold operator, are the same as in the standard EOM-CC method except for the form of the effective Hamiltonian. In the standard EOM-CC calculation, we iteratively determine only a few eigenvalues using the Davidson algorithm instead of explicit diagonalization of the entire matrix M . Here, we present the implementation of this idea within the qEOM method (we focus on the standard Davidson algorithm for low-lying states, but it can be extended to compute interior states or states of a particular character ).In order to compute J excited states, qEOM-UCC/Davidson starts with generating a set of appropriate L orthonormal guess vectors, {|b i ⟩} L≥J i=1 . Then, we measure the matrix elements of H in the given guess vector space and build the subspace Hamiltonian using a quantum', 'standard EOM-CCSD, it scales as ∼ O(n 6 ) . Hence, the major advantage of using quantum devices stems from the efficient evaluation of σ-vectors giving rise to the efficient evaluation of matrix elements of H. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the deviation of the approximate eigenvectors, |c k ⟩, from the true eigenvectors by computing the residual vectors|r k ⟩ = ( H -λ k )|c k ⟩ = L i=1 c k i ( H -λ k )|b i ⟩, k = 1, • • • , J.(28)As per Eq. ( ), the residual vectors are zero for the true eigenvectors. The convergence is assessed by the norm of residual vectors, which also can be measured on quantum devices.The residual vectors |r k ⟩ are linear combinations of excited Slater determinants. Thus, the evaluation of the norms of residual vectors is equivalent to probing the composition of residual vectors, i.e., measurements of overlaps between excited Slater determinants and residual vectors||r k || = N µ=1 |⟨Φ µ |r k ⟩| 2 . (29)Note that {c k i } L,J i=1,k=1 , {λ k } J k=1 , and {b i } L i=1 of Eq. ( ) are already known from the previous steps. Therefore, the qEOM-UCC/Davidson only measures the overlap between Slater determinants and σ-vectors ⟨Φ µ |σ i ⟩. The final step of the qEOM-UCC/Davidson algorithm is the orthonormalization of the residual vectors to the current set of guess vectors and expansion of the vector space with the (orhtonormalized) residuals.

The formed tetrakis(trifluoromethyl)cuprate was quantitatively converted into (MeCN)Cu(CF3)3 (1b) by the treatment with triflic acid. Complex 1b was isolated by aqueous acidic workup and extraction with dichloromethane. In contrast to relatively stable DMF complex 1a, compound 1b should be handled with care and stored in solution at -20 °C.

It is even shorter than Cu-C distances (Cu-C(cis Cu-N) = 1.992( ), 1.962( ) Å, Cu-C(trans Cu-N) = 1.93(1) Å) distances which makes it different from the silver analogue. It is also shorter than Cu(II)-N distances in acetonitrile complexes. This can be attributed to a combination of highly electron-deficient Cu(III) center and sp-hybridization of the nitrogen atom. To the best of our knowledge, this is the shortest Cu-N bond found in the CSD database. Inspired with the success in isolation of Cu(CF3)3 solvates, we investigated the properties of elusive free Cu(CF3)3 molecule by theoretical calculations. First, optimization of the geometry showed that the free Cu(CF3)3 is T-shaped in the absence of any ligand, and the geometry of this fragment is preserved upon solvation (Figure', 'with saturated aqueous hydrochloric acid (entry 1) was unsuccessful.

While the reaction did not take place with nitric acid (entry 3), in the case of strong perchloric acid (pKa = -11) Cu(CF3)3 adduct formed in excellent yield (entry 4). The use of HBF4 was less efficient (entry 5), and the formation of [Cu(CF3)3F] -as a sideproduct was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis, which points to the extremely high Lewis acidity of the formed 1b. Finally, the application of triflic acid afforded quantitative formation of Cu(CF3)3 product (entry 6) after only 5 minutes. Varying the 2/TfOH ratio showed that 2.0 equiv. of TfOH was sufficient for quantitative conversion to Cu(CF3)3 (entry 7). With the optimized synthesis of acetonitrile Cu(CF3)3 adduct we tested the formation of tris(trifluoromethyl)copper complexes in various solvents. Reactions in DMF and DMSO with TfOH (entries 8-9) did not take place, which can be attributed to the ability of TfOH to protonate these solvents. In contrast, less basic oxygen coordinating solvents such as acetone, diethyl ether, and 1,2-dimethoxyethane were applicable for the formation of Cu(CF3)3 adducts (entries 10-12).Finally, we tested a non-coordinating solvent (DCM) for Cu(CF3)3 formation.

Whereas the quantum mechanical picture (proton sharing) should dominate at low temperatures, our 50 K-and 300 K simulation results, along with the deuterated form simulation, strongly suggest that molecule-to-surface proton shuttling (classical mechanical picture) should be the prevailing mechanism at room conditions. These finding might help to shed further light on the behavior and reactive processes involving carboxylic species on TiO 2 surfaces. Moreover, this kind of strong HBs is crucial in several catalytic processes: for instance, short HBs with low barriers are considered essential in enhancing catalytic rates in enzymatic reactions (see, e.g. Refs. ). Strong HBs have been observed also at the surface of some inorganic materials and polymers upon interaction of surface (super)acid protons with adsorbed base molecules. The reactive surface.

Yet, in spite of several decades of investigations, its intimate working mechanisms still remain elusive. In particular, the behavior of the acid proton and its localization -either on the molecule or on the surfaceare still open issues. By modeling the adsorption of formic acid on top of regular (101) anatase TiO 2 surfaces, we found that, in the 0 K limit, the acid proton is shared between a carboxylic oxygen and a surface oxygen. In this regime, the proton behavior is mainly governed by quantum delocalization effects in a single potential well. Nonetheless, as temperature is raised to room conditions, simulations evidenced a rapid ""classical"" shuttling of the proton due to the onset of a two-wells free energy profile separated by a free energy barrier of the order of kT. This picture, supported by the agreement between simulated and experimental IR spectra, shows that the titania surface acts like a protecting group for the carboxylic acid functionality. Such a conceptual insight might help rationalize the chemical processes of carboxylic species on TiO 2 surfaces.', 'Figure ). Hence, taken together, our results suggest that a ""classic"" proton-shuttling model may be eligible to describe the HCOOH adsorption on defect-free portions of anatase TiO 2 {101} surfaces at room temperature. A third remark, which is more chemical in nature, is that both the quantum and the classical picture predict that HCOOH on top of TiO 2 anatase is essentially a neutral moiety (see Bader charges in Table in the SI) with its acid functionality ""protected"" by the surface, owing to the presence of a strong hydrogen bond. Thus, its reactivity may be substantially different from that of a fully-dissociated formic acid -i.e. an adsorbed negatively charged formate and a Brønsted acid surface site formed upon protonation of TiO 2 (101) anatase. Indeed, the ""protecting-group"" role of the surface highlighted by our study might explain, for example, why, carboxylic acids pre-adsorbed on TiO 2 nanoparticles undergo amidation instead of salt formation upon addition of amines. Conclusions By using first principles approaches we propose a model for the adsorption of light carboxylic acids on regular {101} surfaces of TiO 2 -anatase: the adsorbate is bound to a Ti-Lewis acid centre via a carboxyl oxygen, and to a surface oxygen via a ""floating"" proton, with the surface acting like a protecting group for the carboxylic acid functionality, owing to the presence of a short hydrogen bond (HB). This model accounts for the peculiar reactivity of adsorbed carboxylic acids upon addition of amines. The novelty of this picture, which is consistent with spectroscopic experiments, is a dynamical model of the adsorbed moiety, involving either a rapid proton shuttling between a carboxylic and a surface oxygen, or a proton sharing between these two atoms due to quantum delocalization. Whereas the quantum mechanical picture (proton sharing)', 'Results and discussionSimulated IR spectra. Since thermal effects can be crucial in modeling molecular behavior at the interface of materials, including anatase TiO 2 , here we use both geometry optimizations (T= 0 K) and finite temperature first principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) to shed more light on the fate of the formic acid proton. We focus on a regular non-defective (101) model, and adopt different anchoring geometries for the adsorption of HCOOH. We calculate IR patterns by Fourier transform of dipole-dipole autocorrelation functions from the FPMD simulations and compute the free energy for the acid-tosurface proton transfer via a statistical sampling ""bluemoon"" approach. Geometry optimizations were performed as well, at the same level of theory of the FPMD simulations (PBE-functional) in order to obtain structural data at 0 K.

The convergence of the correlation energy is not so certain, and can be improved in three ways: i) by calculating correlation at a higher level of theory, ii) by using a larger basis set or adding diffuse and/or midpoint functions, or iii) by correlating all electrons in the calculation. Higher level correlation in dispersiondominated complexes of similar interaction energies was studied by Řezač and Hobza: the CCSDT(Q) correction to a CCSD(T) energy accounts for only 1-3% of the interaction energy.

The results of this calculation are denoted as aug-MP2+δ(T). All r 0 , r SE e , and r ([1,2]) m', '( 2 )2m and r SE e results. This could be an incompatibility of the cc-pwcV[TQ]Z-PP basis sets used for the frozen-core components with the all-electron TZP basis set used to calculate the δ AE FC (as AE-CCSD(T)/TZP -FC-CCSD(T)/TZP). An all-electron 4-ζ CCSD(T) geometry optimisation is currently prohibitively expensive. On the right panel of Fig. 7 we illustrate the effect relativistic corrections have on the potential energy surface, as well as on the minimum structures. By adding 4-th order corrections using the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian to the MP2+δ(T) potential, we obtain a global minimum that is within 10 mÅ of the r (2) m structure. The O=C••Xe angle is also essentially the same when a linear OCS is assumed in the r (2) m structure. However, it is worth noting that the relativistic effects are double counted in the right panel of Fig. 7: both scalar as well as spin-orbit effects are incorporated into the Xe effective core potentials, 25 the addition of the Douglas-Kroll-Hess correction treats the scalar relativistic effects a second time. These results confirm relativistic effects play an important role in the stabilisation of the Xe• • •OCS complex, but the agreement of the MP2+δ(T)+δ 4 rel results with the r', 'and the main difference is in the O=C••Xe angle. This further confirms that the structure is likely near convergence with respect to basis set size.We have investigated two additional basis set effects: counterpoise correction for the basis set superposition error, and the effect of diffuse functions. The former has no significant effect on the structure, as the difference in the monomer separation obtained from MP2+δ(T) and CP-MP2+δ(T) is only 0.001 Å. On the other hand, the aug-MP2+δ(T) structure obtained with cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z basis sets augmented by diffuse functions (see in Fig. ) is remarkably close to the experimental r(2) m structure, with a disagreement in the monomer separation of only 15 mÅ. While this is most certainly a step in the direction, the increased computational cost compared to cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z calculations is immense: the augmentation of the basis set increases the number of basis functions by 20%, and the amount of memory required for the computation of the connected triples (ie. the (T) component) more than doubles. Notably, additive terms obtained from the differences of augmented and unaugmented 3-ζ calculations that are used in various extrapolation recipes do not perform well for non-covalent complexes. Therefore CCSD(T) computations with augmented 4-ζ basis sets might be unavoidable.Unfortunately, the currently available set of ""aug-cc-pwCVnZ""-quality basis sets is limited to the first two periods in the main group and first row transition metals, and appropriate density fitting basis sets are also unavailable.When the effect of correlating all core electrons is added to the MP2+δ(T) potential surface ( ), the minimum in the potential moves even further away from the r m structure is a case of obtaining a correct answer for the wrong reasons.', '. The calculated MP2+δ(T) binding energies D E are in a good agreement with the experimental values using the Lennard-Jones model for complexes up to Kr. This agreement breaks down with in heavier complexes likely due to relativistic effects. The minor disagreement in the interaction energies compared to previous CCSD(T) literature data can be explained by basis set incompleteness in the literature results. The deformation of the OCS monomer from its equilibrium structure upon complexation is predicted to be minimal, with the largest bend of 0.3 • predicted for Hg• • •OCS. The mass-dependent r (2) m structures of the Xe and Ne complexes differ significantly from the r SE e structures. The bond lengths and angles in the OCS monomer are distorted in the r ([1,2]) m fits, especially the position of the O-atom. However, with the OCS monomer constrained to its equilibrium geometry, the mass-dependent structures are likely the most accurate structures ever obtained for the two complexes. The 43 mÅ difference in the monomer separation in the MP2+δ(T) and r (2) m structures can be partially explained by the lack of diffuse functions in the cc-pwcVnZ basis sets: upon augmentation the difference drops to 15 mÅ. The closest agreement with the r (2) m structure could be obtained by adding the 4-th order relativistic correction (+δ 4 rel ) to the MP2+δ(T) results, highlighting the importance of relativistic effects. However, this procedure cannot be generally recommended, as the scalar relativistic effects are double-counted.

405,"Torsional Parameter FittingThe final backbone torsional parameters and associated errors in the recreation of the QM energy scans are given in Section S3.2 of the Supporting Information. For the alanine and glycine scans, the error for the QUBE force field evaluated using eq 5 is 1.25 kcal/mol compared to 0.93 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M, which is a reasonable level of agreement. For proline and serine, the errors remain comparable to OPLS-AA/M.For the sidechain torsional parameters (Section S3.3), the mean error in the recreation of the QM potential energy scans for the QUBE force field is 1.29 kcal/mol, compared to 1.12 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M. Particularly high errors occur for both the χ 1 and χ 2 glutamic acid scans, and the glutamine χ 2 scan. For glutamic acid, the error is also high for the OPLS-AA/M force field parameters, but the rotamer populations remained close to the experimental data, and this may be due to a problem with the functional form used in classical force fields. The OPLS-AA/M error in the potential energy scan for glutamine is roughly half that of the QUBE force field. However, as we will show, the accuracy of the glutamine dipeptide MD simulations is good, and so no further refinement was made to the sidechain torsional parameters in this work.Although a low error in the reproduction of the QM potential energy surface is clearly the desired result, this does not necessarily correspond to accurate non-bonded force field parameters. The degree to which torsional parameters can improve the fit between MM and QM scans depends not only on the accuracy of the non-bonded, and bond and angle, parameters, but also on the shape of the energy difference between the QM and MM scans.The functional form used in classical MM force fields is very restrictive.

This work focuses on the remaining component of the force field, namely the re-fitting of key torsional parameters that describe the backbone and sidechain dynamics of an amino acid. The methods and validation tests broadly follow the approaches employed in the development of OPLS-AA/M, the latest OPLS force field. Torsional parameters are fit by minimizing the differences between multiple QM and MM potential energy scans of dipeptide backbone and sidechain dihedral angles. Our overall goal is to test the extent to which bespoke non-bonded parameters may be combined with libraries of bonded parameters to produce a protein force field that is compatible with our QUBE small molecule force field for use in computer-aided drug design applications.The performance of the QUBE protein force field is tested through comparisons between experiment and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a set of twenty dipeptides, the glycine tripeptide and alanine pentapeptide, and a range of small folded proteins. This benchmark testset is similar to those used in the development of protein force fields such as AMBER ff15ipq, AMOEBA, CHARMM36 and OPLS-AA/M. As we shall show, the QUBE protein force field is competitive with standard transferable force fields for the dipeptide set and alanine', 'Ten structures were extracted from a MD simulation employing the OPLS-AA/M force field, and QUBE non-bonded parameters were computed for each snapshot. The standard deviation of the charge distribution across the ensemble is just 0.02 e, supporting previous observations that the underlying DDEC atoms-in-molecule charges are relatively independent of conformation. It is important to test whether these system-specific force field parameters translate into more accurate protein interactions and dynamics. In this regard, although the conformational preferences of the peptides tested in the previous section are promising, it is not known whether the torsional parameters will continue to be appropriate for use with proteins. As the non-bonded parameters vary with the system studied, the transferability of torsional parameters cannot be readily assumed. To assess this we begin by studying MD simulations of the proteins ubiquitin and GB3.The J coupling errors for ubiquitin and GB3 are summarized in Table . With an overall RMSE of 1.54 Hz, the error using the QUBE force field for ubiquitin is higher than that of OPLS-AA/M, which has an RMSE of 1.12 Hz, but lower than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L with errors of 1.84 Hz and 1.70 Hz respectively. 1 GB3 follows the same trend with an RMSE of 1.10 Hz for the QUBE force field, compared to the error for OPLS-AA/M of 0.90 Hz, whilst OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L both have an error of 1.46 Hz. 1 The J coupling results suggest that whilst the transfer of torsional parameters from dipeptides to proteins may cause some issues, the QUBE force field remains more accurate than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L. This is promising when we consider that OPLS has been in development for many years with multiple iterations and parameter adjustments performed.The 3 J(H α , H β ) coupling term is the main contributor to the J coupling', 'Fitting Dipeptide Torsional ParametersTorsional parameters were optimized by minimizing the error function shown in eq 5 using asteepest descent algorithm. MM potential energy surfaces were computed by scanning dihedral angles in 15 • increments using the BOSS software. The backbone torsional parameters for all dipeptides tested, excluding serine and threonine, were fit to the alanine and glycine scans previously described. The total error for the two scans was given by:Error Total = 0.928 × Error Ala + 0.072 × Error Gly (6)  with the prefactors corresponding to the relative frequency of each amino acid in the human proteome. Preliminary testing (Section S1.1) showed that a weighting function and regularization did not significantly improve the conformations sampled during the dipeptide MD simulations and so were not used (λ = 0, W = 0).The remaining dipeptides, threonine and serine (both of which contain aliphatic hydroxyl groups in their sidechain), were assigned identical backbone parameters that were fit to reproduce the QM scans of serine. For these scans, regularization and weighting were shown to be necessary to produce dipeptide dynamics which were in agreement with experiment.An investigation of how the simulation error changes with regularization is given in Section S1.2. The harmonic restraint parameter was set to λ = 0.05.The sidechain scans for all dipeptides followed the same fitting process as the alanine/glycine backbone with no weighting or regularization used. As atom-typing is not used for the non-bonded parameter assignment in the QUBE force field, each set of sidechain torsional parameters is also residue-specific. This differs from the approach used in OPLS-AA/M in which sidechain torsional parameters with the same set of atom types are generally assigned the same parameters.In a number of cases', 'This is similar to the conformational propensity observed for OPLS-AA/M (53.5 ± 0.2 %). Both force fields also result in a low α-helical population, which is consistent with experimental data. 6: The ψ and φ distribution for the glycine tetrapeptide (all residues are included) using a) the QUBE force field and b) OPLS-AA/M, plotted in the form -log(p ψ,φ ) (where p ψ,φ is the probability of a region being occupied). The lighter regions correspond to low probability areas including conformations that are not sampled during the simulation.The problems associated with using the Karplus parameters for Gly 3 are discussed in Section S9 of the Supporting Information and elsewhere. Therefore, we evaluate the backbone conformations of Gly 3 through its φ/ψ distribution alone. In Figure , the OPLS-AA/M backbone conformational distribution is compared to that obtained using the QUBE force field. A lower α-helical population is occupied by the QUBE force field, but otherwise both distributions are very similar.The MD simulations presented here have demonstrated that the QUBE force field, and the parameterization methods used to create it, are sufficiently accurate to recreate conformational propensities of short, flexible peptides. The errors in the simulated dynamics of these molecules are comparable to OPLS-AA/M, and the φ/ψ distributions demonstrate that the major conformations observed in protein structures are populated. Issues with the transferability of torsional parameters have already been identified from the longer peptide simulations, and are solved by applying regularization. In the following subsection, the performance of QUBE for entire proteins is evaluated to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the methodology to macromolecules and to further understand the', 'of the proteins generally remained close to the experimental structures, but the β-sheets exhibited greater loss of structure, and regions with no clear structure or exhibiting a turn regularly deviated from the starting structure.These regions also contributed greatest to J coupling errors. Despite this, the majority of the regions in the proteins retained their experimental structure and the J coupling errors for GB3 and ubiquitin were below those of OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L, two force fields regularly used in biomolecular modelling studies.Whilst developing QUBE, manual adjustments to some torsional parameters were required. This was also required in the development of OPLS-AA/M, and we can infer from this that automatically fitting backbone and sidechain torsional parameters using dihedral energy scans is still challenging. The most obvious failure of dihedral energy scan fitting was that for a number of sidechains it was more accurate to set the torsional parameters to zero than to use the originally derived terms. This is in part due to the functional form used, with potential improvements to this discussed below, but is also due to the poor sampling of relevant structures by scanning one or two dihedral angles at a time. This problem is reduced by the iterative fitting methods used in AMBER ff14ipq and ff15ipq, 2,38 which sample the structures used for torsional parameter fitting by performing MD simulations with the current iteration of the force field. This approach will be considered in future versions of the force field.Another potential source of error is the choice of modified Seminario method for derivation of bond and angle force constants. However, this method has been shown to accurately reproduce QM vibrational frequencies, and importantly also reproduce QM intramolecular potential energy surfaces of drug-like molecules when combined with the QUBE non-bonded and torsion parameters. <ref']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Unclassified']",347,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9982013792616664,-2.220446049250313e-16,"['for', 'which']"

Note that by moving the pump pulse through the refocussing period the in-and anti-phase coherences become effectively \'phase-labelled\', a technique earlier used to facilitate the quantum state tomography of a hybrid electron-nuclear system. 9It is important to note that only spin centres on resonance with the refocussing pulse and whose partner spins are inverted by the pump pulse will contribute an oscillatory component to the trace, with the rest either not contributing to the recorded echo or adding an unmodulated offset to its intensity.

Experimentally the filter pulses were applied at a time such that their centre corresponded to the maximum echo intensity, and we mimic this in our simulations. The fidelity of the operations is determined by comparing the quantum state at time 2𝜏 0 to the expected coherence. For the 'single molecule' model system, in which both spins are directly on resonance with the applied pulses, the simulated fidelity decreases uniformly as the pulse length is increased. For 1 ns pulses the fidelity of all pairs of operations is 1.0000, but this drops to between 0.9788 and 0.9882 for a pulse length of 80 ns (Figure ). There is no discernible pattern between the pairs of operations and their sensitivity to pulse length.Just as for the simulations of the entangling gate, the fidelity of the filter pulses is highly dependent on the spectral linewidth and drops to around 0.6 as the linewidth exceeds the pulse bandwidth (Figure ). This decrease is approximately the same for both in-and antiphase coherences and for all operator pairs. As the difference between the resonance frequency of a spin packet and the frequency of the microwave pulse increases, the spin is less affected by the pulse and retains more of its original magnetisation. As such the application of filter pulses to broad spectra results in a statistical mixture of excited and unexcited magnetisation. "", 'DEER Assisted TomographyTo quantitatively assess the generation of anti-phase coherences by the DFHE entangling gate with 𝜏 = + !"" 2 (125 ns), and thus the gate fidelity, it is necessary to fully determine the state of the system. We achieve this by applying the DEERATom procedure, implemented using the 5P-DFHE-DEERATom sequence (Figure ). By recording the real and imaginary components of the nine pairs of operations at both frequencies we obtain thirty-six traces, each of which will contain cosine and sine oscillations with amplitudes proportional to the expectation values of the Cartesian product operators present at 2𝜏 ; (Section 9.1).A typical DEER experiment will employ a phase cycle to account for undesired coherence pathways and imperfect spectrometer calibration. However, the requirement to measure both real and imaginary components of the traces precludes the application of a phase cycle involving the detection sequence. By using an incoherent microwave source to generate the pump pulses, it is possible to remove 𝑡-dependent \'echo-crossing\' artefacts experimentally, but this does not affect static offsets or partially filtered magnetisation and so these must be considered in data analysis. To account for static offsets we recognise that the background decay parameter, 𝑘, for a given sample is dependent only on the fraction of spins in the sample excited by the pump pulse. All DEER and DEERATom traces recorded with the same pump pulse should have the same background decay parameter, allowing the offsets to be isolated.

Since the major percentage of the SFC mobile phase consists of CO2 in the sub-or-super-critical state, the high diffusivity and low viscosity of such mobile phase enable SFC to be operated under higher optimum linear velocity than HPLC, making the chromatography very fast.Moreover, unlike HPLC, the density of the super/sub-critical mobile phase can be easily manipulated by changing its pressure and temperature, which consequently dictates its solvating power (i.e., a mobile phase with high density implies better solvating capacity). For example, when the backpressure of an SFC system is increased and the thermostat temperature is decreased, the density of the mobile phase increases, and so does the dissolution ability or the solvating power of the mobile phase. Such phenomenon of the mobile phase provides flexibility to the SFC users to further adjust various chromatographic parameters such as selectivity and retention of the solutes.

Such a relationship between density and solubility consequently impacts the selectivity and retention of solutes and contributes to the overall resolution of the chromatographic separation. Interestingly, in SFC, unlike HPLC, the density of the mobile phase along the column can be manipulated by controlling the backpressure (post-column pressure) of the system by means of a backpressure regulator.

To that end, researchers are turning to organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) as the display materials due to higher energy saving and richer color compared to liquid crystal displays (LCDs). However, one major setback of the OLED technology is that the devices are very sensitive to the impurities present in the OLED materials, impacting device lifetime, stability, and overall performance. The isolation of large quantities of the main OLED components from the synthetic impurities is challenging using the traditional purification process (i.e., train sublimation), which has poor reproducibility, and high capital and operating cost.

The quantum circuit that generates quantum state of Eq. ( ) is shown in Fig. . An arbitrary quantum superposition state can be generated using only single excitation operators using the Gray code scheme resulting in a smaller number of multi-qubit controlled-NOT gates than the aforementioned scheme. We decompose the quantum circuits of Figs. 1 and 2 into the elementary single and two-qubit gates using the IBM Qiskit software . The gate decompositions result in 316 generic single-qubit rotation gates and 200 CNOT gates for the quantum circuit of Fig. .Alternatively, the quantum circuit of Fig. requires 224 generic single-qubit rotation and 144 CNOT gates. As can be seen from the numerical gate counts, the Gray code scheme with only single excitations yields a compact quantum circuit. In this paper, however, we employ the fixed reference scheme to facilitate the generalization of circuit constructions.The qEOM-UCC/Davidson protocol needs quantum devices to measure the matrix elements of H and the norm of residual vectors, as per Eqs. ( ) and ( ). This contains a large number of off-diagonal element measurements, ⟨b i | H|b j ⟩ i̸ =j and ⟨Φ µ | H|b i ⟩, which usually require an ancilla qubit, in addition to the diagonal elements , ⟨b i | H|b i ⟩. Note that ⟨b i | H|b j ⟩ = ⟨Φ 0 | Û † i H Ûj |Φ 0 ⟩ and ⟨Φ µ | H|b i ⟩ = ⟨Φ 0 | Ê † µ', 'consisting of particular excited Slater determinants. In addition, the relative phases between the determinants should be easily adjustable within the reduced Hilbert space.In order to demonstrate the general state preparation scheme for the qEOM-UCC/Davidson method, we consider a simple example-2 particles in 4 spinorbitals-for which the subspace is spanned by 6 electronic configurations,{|1100⟩, |0110⟩, |1001⟩, |0101⟩, |1010⟩, |0011⟩}.Considering excitations that conserve spin projection (∆m s = 0), one needs unitary operators that transform the initial reference qubit state (typically, the Hartree-Fock determinant, |1100⟩) into the superposition of 4 particular electronic configurations with a set of controllable parametersU (θ 3 )U (θ 2 )U (θ 1 )|1100⟩ = cos θ 1 2 cos θ 2 2 cos θ 3 2 |1100⟩ + sin θ 1 2 |0110⟩ + cos θ 1 2 sin θ 2 2 |1001⟩ + cos θ 1 2 cos θ 2 2 sin θ 3 2 |0011⟩.(34)Eq. ( ) implies that the successive operations of U (θ 1 ), U (θ 2 ), and U (θ 3 ) on the reference state generate a particular target determinant at each operation. In addition, adjustable parameters are introduced to both reference |1100⟩ (cos θ i 2 ) and target configurations (sin θ i 2 ). This parameterization scheme ensures normalization of the resulting qubit state and facilitates the incorporation of spin symmetries. For example, a triplet excited state can be generated only with U (θ 1 ) and U (θ 2 ) with the specific values of θ 1 and θ 2U (θ 2 = π)U (θ 1 = π 2 )|1100⟩ = 1 √ 2 (|1001⟩ + |0110⟩).(35)A singlet excited state with only singly excited determinants can be generated in a similar fashionU (θ 2 = π)U (θ 1 = - π 2 )|1100⟩ = 1 √ 2 (|1001⟩ -|0110⟩).(36)To construct a quantum circuit for this', 'Considering the Davidson method the particular set of {|Φ µ ⟩} can be obtained by examining the residual vectors. Hence, one needs to construct the quantum circuit that generates an arbitrary vector subspace where {|Φ µ ⟩} spans, and introduce corresponding {γ k µ } as variational parameters to find a k th state. Since the number of state vectors (= the number of variational parameters) that construct the vector subspace is considerably smaller than that of the entire Hilbert space, the variational approach with the Davidson formalism helps to circumvent barren plateaus phenomenon .In practical applications, we need to preserve the spin-symmetry and ensure the orthonormality between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in the course of the minimization process.To achieve this, we generalize the spin-restricted form of the Gray code circuit with minor modifications of the scheme introduced in the previous section. To illustrate this, let us examine the H 2 /STO-3G system, which corresponds to Eq. ( ), and try to find the S 1 state variationally. The Gray code scheme for the non-variational approach in the previous section creates the desired quantum superposition by connecting the fixed reference state with the target excited Slater determinant at a time. In this way, one introduces parameters to both reference and target configurations at each operation. There is no direct connection between excited configurations, which have to be spin-adapted, e.g., between |0110⟩ and |1001⟩ of Eq. ( ). As a result, the variational process with this circuit construction never produces S 1 state as the solution because T 1 state is always lower than S 1 in H 2 /STO-3G. Furthermore, the variational solution is', 'on a quantum device and then solves the eigenvalue problem of Eq. ( ) on a classical computer. Thus, qEOM also needs classical machines to diagonalize the measured matrix. The number of matrix elements to measure on quantum computers and the dimension of the matrix to diagonalize on classical computers depend on the level of correlation treatment and the one-electron basis set. By restricting the excitation levels to singles and doubles, the quantum computer is required to measure about N ∼ n occ × n vir + n 2 occ × n 2 vir matrix elements and the classical computer is required to diagonalize N × N matrix, which scales as O(N 3 ). Although the dimension of the matrix M can considerably be reduced by utilizing the sparsity and symmetries of the Hamiltonian, the scaling quickly reaches the intractable regime as the system size increases.Eqs. ( ) and (22), which are the working equation of qEOM with the self-consistent manifold operator, are the same as in the standard EOM-CC method except for the form of the effective Hamiltonian. In the standard EOM-CC calculation, we iteratively determine only a few eigenvalues using the Davidson algorithm instead of explicit diagonalization of the entire matrix M . Here, we present the implementation of this idea within the qEOM method (we focus on the standard Davidson algorithm for low-lying states, but it can be extended to compute interior states or states of a particular character ).In order to compute J excited states, qEOM-UCC/Davidson starts with generating a set of appropriate L orthonormal guess vectors, {|b i ⟩} L≥J i=1 . Then, we measure the matrix elements of H in the given guess vector space and build the subspace Hamiltonian using a quantum', 'standard EOM-CCSD, it scales as ∼ O(n 6 ) . Hence, the major advantage of using quantum devices stems from the efficient evaluation of σ-vectors giving rise to the efficient evaluation of matrix elements of H. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the deviation of the approximate eigenvectors, |c k ⟩, from the true eigenvectors by computing the residual vectors|r k ⟩ = ( H -λ k )|c k ⟩ = L i=1 c k i ( H -λ k )|b i ⟩, k = 1, • • • , J.(28)As per Eq. ( ), the residual vectors are zero for the true eigenvectors. The convergence is assessed by the norm of residual vectors, which also can be measured on quantum devices.The residual vectors |r k ⟩ are linear combinations of excited Slater determinants. Thus, the evaluation of the norms of residual vectors is equivalent to probing the composition of residual vectors, i.e., measurements of overlaps between excited Slater determinants and residual vectors||r k || = N µ=1 |⟨Φ µ |r k ⟩| 2 . (29)Note that {c k i } L,J i=1,k=1 , {λ k } J k=1 , and {b i } L i=1 of Eq. ( ) are already known from the previous steps. Therefore, the qEOM-UCC/Davidson only measures the overlap between Slater determinants and σ-vectors ⟨Φ µ |σ i ⟩. The final step of the qEOM-UCC/Davidson algorithm is the orthonormalization of the residual vectors to the current set of guess vectors and expansion of the vector space with the (orhtonormalized) residuals.

However, the resemblance of the SOMO to a d z 2 function is misleading, and is a consequence of the spherical form of s functions and the small contributions from individual ligand atoms (none larger than 2%, however their sum accounts for ca. 42% of the SOMO).Our CASSCF calculations show that the first excited state is only ca. 9000 cm -1 above the ground state, and that it can be described as a metal-to-ligand charge transfer state with the unpaired electron occupying an unusually diffuse ligand orbital (largest Y contribution is 3% 4d, with 89% deriving from ligand functions; Fig. and Table ). There are seven excited states less than 20,000 cm -1 above the ground state, all having the unpaired electron in very diffuse ligand based orbitals (Figs. S37 -S43and Tables ). This indicates that the electron is easily delocalized across the molecule, and explains why the SOMO cannot be simply described as either a 4d z 2 or 5s function on Y.

The HPLC separation of OLED compounds, especially in the case of structural homologs/analogs and geometric/optical isomers of OLEDs, often entails compromised resolution due to the lack of selectivity (tend to co-elute). Chromatographic method development for such structurally similar compounds and isomers is laborious and timeconsuming. Moreover, impurities or degradation products are often structurally very similar to the analytes; as a result, they elute on the front or tail of the main analyte peak or potentially remain hidden under the target chromatographic peak. In such a scenario, it becomes practically difficult for the analysts to detect and remove impurities from the main peak, especially in the preparative scale when the higher mass load becomes critical. In addition to the chromatographic resolution, HPLC analysis of OLEDs, in most cases, involves normal phase chromatography that utilizes 100% organic solvents as the mobile phase due to the low solubility of the most OLED compounds in the aqueous-based solvents. Utilization of such a high volume of organic solvent is hazardous from the environmental perspective and costly.Sivasubramaniam, et al. utilized three columns in series and used 100% acetonitrile as the mobile phase to separate a standard mixture of only four OLED compounds in about 50 minutes -this is an example of HPLC separation of OLEDs with a considerable waste of time and resources. Therefore, the utilization of preparative HPLC for the purification of OLEDs becomes a poor choice due to the requirement of excessive energy and high dry-down time to deal with such a high volume of organic solvent.

However, one major setback of the OLED technology is that the devices are very sensitive to the impurities present in the OLED materials, impacting device lifetime, stability, and overall performance. The isolation of large quantities of the main OLED components from the synthetic impurities is challenging using the traditional purification process (i.e., train sublimation), which has poor reproducibility, and high capital and operating cost. Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) could lend itself as an alternative technique for the profiling of impurities and their purification.

However, this conventional sublimation technique has several downsides. For example, this technique frequently requires multiple sublimation cycles causing the entire process to take up to several days to achieve the desired purity level. This technique also results in lower yield due to loss of materials. Therefore, this process is time-consuming and less efficient. Besides, it has been recently discovered that some organotransition metal complexes (e.g., bis-cyclometalated iridium complexes) used as OLED materials can undergo in-situ thermal isomerization during this process and result in a mixture of isomers.

After liquid flowed through the impinging sheet device, droplets from the mixed sheet were collected in a tank.Photographs were taken in darkness using a digital camera at a resolution of 13.49 megapixels (4496 x 3000). The exposure time was 1/60th of a second or 16.7 ms. The digital photographs were stored on a computer for subsequent processing. During experimentation, it was found that placing the UV panel directly to the side of the mixed sheet (as opposed to behind or in front) produced the highest contrast photographs. Specifically, background fluorescence and reflection from the mixed sheet were minimized.The UV light panel could not produce sufficient light in a dark room to allow for microsecond flash photography as has been previously used . Hence, the photographs were not ""frozen in time"". However, the unsteady state reaction of acid with base proceeded in a quasi-steady state manner, in the sense that the initial reactant concentrations, flowrates and velocities did not change. Although the fluorescence varied from point to point (or pixel to pixel) it was assumed to remain invariant at a specific point (pixel) during the exposure time of 16.7 ms.A typical experimental run included taking photographs of aqueous HCl impinging with aqueous NaOH and self-impingement of six reference solutions at constant experimental conditions.

For all experiments, the stoichiometric ratios were either 2:1, 4:1 or 4.6:1 with acid always in excess. Tap water was used as the solvent due to the large quantities of liquids required for an experimental run (typically, a total of 100 to 125 liters for acid, base and four reference solutions).Since relatively large quantities of solutions were required for an experimental run, the temperature was not held constant from one run to the next. Instead, the temperature of the solutions was allowed to equilibrate with the ambient temperature. The temperature of the experiments ranged from 10 o to 20 o C; therefore, the calculated kinematic viscosity (𝜈) of the aqueous solutions varied from 1x10 -6 m 2 /s to 1.3x10 -6 m 2 /s.The impinging single sheets were equal in all physical parameters such as viscosity, velocity and single sheet thickness at impingement. The range of experimental conditions included impingement angles (2𝛽) from 28 o to 105 o , single sheet velocities (𝑢) from 3 m/s to 13.4 m/s and single sheet thickness at impingement (𝑠 𝑖 ) from 24 microns to 280 microns. Table lists some typical characteristics of the four, different impinging sheet devices studied. Methods for creating and impinging sheets are detailed elsewhere . The experimental setup is illustrated schematically in Figure . The liquids to be impinged were routed to the apparatus by appropriately setting the positions of selector valves (ISV), which were located prior to the pumps.

For the acid-base impingement, the fluorescence profiles were additionally affected by the pH, which varied along a radial line indicating the progress of the neutralization reaction.The background-adjusted, fluorescence intensity profiles for all photographs of the impinging solutions in the stack shown in Figure is illustrated in Figure . Since the velocity in the mixed sheet was constant, the time traveled by the liquid along the radial line shown in Figure , as measured from the impingement zone, was simply equal to the pixel distance from the impingement zone (𝑟) divided by the mixed sheet velocity (𝑣 𝑚 ).Figure illustrates that the collision of the liquids causes the fluorescence intensity to rapidly increase and peak in the impingement zone, especially for the acid-base mixture and for the neutral and basic mixtures (pH 7, pH 8, and pH 10). Once the liquid leaves the impingement zone, there is a rapid decay in fluorescence intensity. However, the figure shows that the slope of the decay for the acid-base impingement is steeper than the slope of decay for the constant pH solutions. In Figure , for example, after 1.8 ms, the acid-base mixed sheet fluoresced as if the average pH were 7. At about 10 ms, the acid-base mixture fluoresced as if the average pH were equal to 6.0. At any pixel along the radial line shown in Figure , fluorescence intensities (𝐹𝐼) for the constant pH solutions allow for a 𝐹𝐼 versus [𝑂𝐻 -] chart to be plotted. Figure plots 𝐹𝐼 versus [𝑂𝐻 -] at 𝑟 = 500 on Figure for the constant pH solutions only.

The neutralization reaction proceeds as follows:𝐻𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) + 𝑁𝑎𝑂𝐻(𝑎𝑞) → 𝑁𝑎𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻 2 𝑂(20)Photographs of the resulting mixed sheet were taken and the variation of fluorescence intensity with location in the mixed sheet was determined using ImageJ software .The fluorescing agent was added in equal concentrations to all solutions. Equal fluorophore concentrations in all impinging liquids ensured that there were no concentration gradients of fluorophore in the mixed sheet, and therefore, the ""sensing"" of the progress of the instantaneous neutralization reaction was limited only by the diffusion of acid and base. The time required for the transition from the excited state to the ground state with emission of fluorescence was also considered to be ""instantaneous"" since it takes place within 10 -8 seconds .The pH-sensitive fluorophore was umbelliferone, which fluoresces brightly under basic conditions but at a much lower level under acidic conditions . Since umbelliferone is only slightly soluble in water, it was first dissolved in 200 ml of 99%+ ethanol and then added to the solutions yielding a final concentration of 25 ppm by weight. The umbelliferone was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and was specifically labeled as ""suitable for fluorescence indicator, > 98.0% (HPLC)"".The fluorescence intensity, 𝐹𝐼, is a function of', 'for acid impinging upon acid and 𝐹𝐼 for base impinging upon base. This amounts to assuming that the base single sheet is adjacent and adjoined to an acid single sheet and the UV light is passing through both of them (this is only potentially true in the impingement zone where it is assumed that little to no reaction of acid with base has occurred).In Figure , the experimental fluorescence intensity at the end of the impingement zone for acid impinging upon acid is 30.00 gray scale units. For base impinging upon base the value is 128.67 and for acid impinging with base, the value is 101.33. These values are for the mixed sheet formed in the impingement zone, which is approximately twice the thickness of the single sheets.If a base single sheet were adjacent to an acid single sheet in the impingement zone, the calculated value for 𝐹𝐼 would be: where 𝐹𝐼 𝑖,𝑐 is the calculated fluorescence of a combined mixed sheet that consists of an acid single sheet adjoining a base single sheet with UV light passing through this hypothetical mixed sheet. The factor of 2 is included because the 𝐹𝐼 values for acid-acid impingement and base-base impingement are for the mixed sheet in the impingement zone. However, for the acid-base impingement, the acid and base each comprise only half of the thickness of the mixed sheet in the impingement zone. An initial estimate for the scaling factor (𝑆𝐹 𝑖 ) is then: Where 𝐹𝐼 𝑖,𝑒 is the experimental fluorescence intensity in the impingement zone (101.33 gray scale units) for acid-base impingement measured using Image J.

AP-MM/MM simulations show that the SDAC method improves over the previous AC method, since the SDAC dynamics, number of defects, and the shape of the disordered region agrees better with those of the 'higherlevel' MM method than the AC results. Although the motivation for developing the SDAC method is for the simulation of the DD generation, the method is applicable to general problems in which active regions may occur or vanish during the simulation and have a speed dependence, such as the dynamics of shockwaves or collisions.The SDAC PES is speed-dependent, and the usual EOM in MD becomes inapplicable. I develop an energy-conserving SDAC EOM, which is different from Newton's second law by the SDEM term. The time integration of the non-standard EOM is carried out with the EPS algorithm. The dynamics of the SDAC QM/MM system can be expected to be close to that of the real system when the SDEM is much smaller than atomic masses. I show that the size of the SDEM can be effectively tuned by the functional form of the SDAC criterion property, which allows the SDAC method to be applicable in general systems.The transition forces in AP-QM/MM lead to geometry distortions and artificial heating. The same effect is observed in the SDAC simulations, and is found to be significant when the higher-level and lower-level methods of QM/MM differ a lot.

The lattice constant is fixed at 5.43 Å to ensure that the results of different methods are directly comparable. The Si atom at the center of the simulation box is chosen as the PKA. The initial kinetic energy of the PKA is set to 1 keV, and the initial velocity is 7 • away from the z direction to avoid channelling. The results are shown in Fig. .

The energy conservation is ensured by the EOM and is not affected by the changes in the SDEM.

This resulted in formation of the catalyst in the form of a dry powder. Characterization was carried out using diffuse reflectance measurements where a strong plasmon absorption band was observed at 520 nm (see SI-1), confirming the presence of Au nanoparticles in size range of 10 to 20 nm. In a typical experiment, a loosely packed bed of catalyst was placed in the reaction chamber and purged with dry nitrogen for a few hours and subsequently, the reaction chamber was evacuated. Following this, H 2 and D 2 gases (both 99.99% pure) were filled in equal amounts with a total pressure of 1 bar. Reaction was carried out in a closed system (with intermittent sampling), either by heating the catalyst bed using a heater under dark conditions (thermal)or under light illumination of the catalyst bed (light-induced).A schematic diagram of our experimental setup is shown in figure (left panel). It consists of a custom-made stainless steel reaction chamber equipped with several gas inlets mbar (sampling off).

Top panel depicts the partial pressures measured by mass spectrometer as the reaction progresses towards equilibrium. It can be clearly seen that with increasing time H 2 and D 2 are consumed and a corresponding increase is seen in HD. Middle panel shows the fraction of H 2 , D 2 and HD (f H 2 , f D 2 and f HD , respectively) in the gas mixture observed as a function of time. It is worth pointing out that fractional pressures are a more robust quantity than the partial pressures themselves since variations in sampling signal caused by changes in nozzle performance over time and overall pressure increase in the reaction chamber due to temperature increase gets cancelled out. It can also be seen that at longer times (greater than 20000 seconds, approximately) the system reaches a steady state and the change in fraction (concentration) of each component is very small. Bottom panel shows the as a function of time. Clearly, at longer times this quantity reaches steady state, which corresponds to the equilibrium constant. It should be noted that different gases have different sensitivity factors for detection by the mass spectrometer. In these thermal experiments, since steady state temperatures of the catalyst bed (measured using a thermocouple) and hence K eq are known quantities, these measurements are used to derive the gas dependent sensitivity factors. Using these gas sensitivity factors, evaluation of K eq values in case of light-induced experiments (where temperature is unknown) was carried', 'and temperature as shown in figure (right panel). Here, the blue curve depicts K eq evaluated using statistical thermodynamics over a range of temperatures (see SI-2 for details) and the points show values available in literature. From the variation in rate constants observed with temperature, activation energies were evaluated for both light and thermally-driven reactions. A comparison of these allows us to deduce signatures of different pathways in both these cases.In order to test the possibility of any spurious signal HD signal originating from catalytic activity of the metallic walls of the reaction chamber, control experiments were carried out with only the silica powder (Au nanoparticles absent). In case of thermally-driven reaction, HD fraction observed in absence of Au nanoparticles was smaller than 5% of the total HD produced (SI-3). For light-induced reaction, this quantity was several orders of magnitude smaller (SI-3). These observations establish that HD production in our system is mainly catalyzed by the presence of Au nanoparticles and contribution of any other part of the reaction chamber (such as stainless steel surface etc.) is relatively much smaller.Consequently, we have ignored this small fraction of HD in further analysis of our results.', '60-100 sec. These settings ensured that there is a steady state build up of gas pressure in the sampling chamber (typically, 1 -5 × 10 -6 mbar) which is detected by the mass spectrometer.For thermal experiments, a stainless steel cup shaped holder for the catalyst bed with a cartridge type heater attached at the bottom (outside the reaction chamber) was used. A home-built temperature controller was used to control the catalyst bed temperature within 1 K of the set temperature over the entire course of measurements. Temperature was monitored using a K-type thermocouple tip (0.3 mm diameter) immersed in the catalyst bed. Thickness of the catalyst bed was 5 mm for thermal experiments and temperature difference over this thickness was measured to be less than 3 K. Reactant gases, H 2 and D 2 were allowed to mix for 20 to 30 min in the reaction chamber before heating was started. Sampling of gas mixture was started after a steady temperature was attained on catalytic sample. For the light driven reaction, second harmonic of pulsed Nd +3 :YAG laser (Spectra Physics, Ascend, pulse width:200ns, repetition rate: 1 kHz, wavelength: 532 nm) was used at different intensities. A collimated laser beam with 8 mm cross sectional diameter was made incident on the catalyst (1 mm thick bed) sample to excite the Au nanoparticles.For both thermal and light-induced reactions, sampling performed at initial stages of the reaction was used to determine the change in fraction of HD, using which initial rate and rate constants were calculated. In the case of light-induced reaction, measurement of temperatures is particularly challenging and error prone. Instead, we rely on a strategy where effective temperature of the reaction sites were estimated using the well-defined relationship among K eq and temperature as shown in figure (right panel).

An example of the Gray code quantum circuit that generates the qubit state of Eq. ( ) is shown in Fig.1. The process of populating a desired quantum state starts with the transformation of the initial qubit state |0⟩ ⊗ n into N -particle subspace, where n and N correspond to the number of qubits and particles in the system of interest, respectively. Next, one designs unitary operators using the Gray code decomposition as shown in the example quantum circuit of particles with respect to the reference qubit state. The subsequent multi-qubit controlled-R y (θ i ) creates additional 1 particle to the state (completion of M hM p excitation) as well as introduces the parameters to the reference (cos θ i 2 ) and the target excited determinant (sin θ i 2 ). The Gray code for the single unitary operation is completed by the same 2M -1 multi-qubit controlled-NOT gates, but in the reversed order. It should be mentioned that the target electronic configurations do not have to be populated from the fixed reference state. For example, the doubly excited determinant of Eq. ( ) can be created from one of the singly excited determinants giving rise to different parameterizationsU (θ 3 )U (θ 2 )U (θ 1 )|1100⟩ = cos θ 1 2 cos θ 2 2 |1100⟩ + sin θ 1 2 cos θ 3 2 |0110⟩ + cos θ 1 2 sin θ 2 2 |1001⟩ + sin θ 1 2 sin θ 3 2 |0011⟩,(37)where two singly excited Slater determinants (|0110⟩ and |1001⟩) are generated by single excitation with respect to the reference |1100⟩, and the doubly excited configuration |0011⟩ is', 'D. Gray code decompositionThe ground state is the lowest energy eigenstate. The existing state preparation schemes, such as UCCSD and hardware-efficient ansatz , are designed to effectively search the Hilbert space of a quantum system. They are commonly used to provide trial wavefunctions in the VQE method for searching the ground state. Excited-state preparation schemes require additional features compared to that of the ground state. For example, the excitedstate ansatz should be capable of populating particular electronic configurations out of the entire Hilbert space (e.g., singlet-coupled HOMO-LUMO excitation). In addition, the ansatz should be able to easily adjust the components of a desired quantum state. Consider, for instance, the H 2 /6-31G example for which the number of all possible electronic configurations is 8 2 . To compute the S 1 state (at 1 Å bondlength), we need to prepare the superposition of two singly excited configurations (excitation from σ to σ * with respect to the reference vacuum state |11000000⟩) with the equal weights as an initial guess vector |b 1 ⟩. In the qubit representation, the initial guess vector is|b 1 ⟩ = 1 √ 2 (|01100000⟩ -|10010000⟩),(32)where |0⟩ and |1⟩ represent unoccupied and occupied spin-orbitals, respectively. Here, we map the spin-orbitals onto the qubits in the top-to-bottom order, such that the lowest energy orbitals are at the top, to be consistent with our implementation using OpenFermion. As per Eqs. ( ) and (33), one needs to design unitary operations that transform an arbitrary qubit state ⊗ n i=1 |0⟩ into a particular superposition state, i.e., the quantum state consisting of particular excited Slater determinants. In addition, the relative phases between', 'consisting of particular excited Slater determinants. In addition, the relative phases between the determinants should be easily adjustable within the reduced Hilbert space.In order to demonstrate the general state preparation scheme for the qEOM-UCC/Davidson method, we consider a simple example-2 particles in 4 spinorbitals-for which the subspace is spanned by 6 electronic configurations,{|1100⟩, |0110⟩, |1001⟩, |0101⟩, |1010⟩, |0011⟩}.Considering excitations that conserve spin projection (∆m s = 0), one needs unitary operators that transform the initial reference qubit state (typically, the Hartree-Fock determinant, |1100⟩) into the superposition of 4 particular electronic configurations with a set of controllable parametersU (θ 3 )U (θ 2 )U (θ 1 )|1100⟩ = cos θ 1 2 cos θ 2 2 cos θ 3 2 |1100⟩ + sin θ 1 2 |0110⟩ + cos θ 1 2 sin θ 2 2 |1001⟩ + cos θ 1 2 cos θ 2 2 sin θ 3 2 |0011⟩.(34)Eq. ( ) implies that the successive operations of U (θ 1 ), U (θ 2 ), and U (θ 3 ) on the reference state generate a particular target determinant at each operation. In addition, adjustable parameters are introduced to both reference |1100⟩ (cos θ i 2 ) and target configurations (sin θ i 2 ). This parameterization scheme ensures normalization of the resulting qubit state and facilitates the incorporation of spin symmetries. For example, a triplet excited state can be generated only with U (θ 1 ) and U (θ 2 ) with the specific values of θ 1 and θ 2U (θ 2 = π)U (θ 1 = π 2 )|1100⟩ = 1 √ 2 (|1001⟩ + |0110⟩).(35)A singlet excited state with only singly excited determinants can be generated in a similar fashionU (θ 2 = π)U (θ 1 = - π 2 )|1100⟩ = 1 √ 2 (|1001⟩ -|0110⟩).(36)To construct a quantum circuit for this', '4-qubit quantum circuit that generates a superposition state of Eq.

One of the most prominent and versatile methods is the metal-catalyzed coupling of thiols with aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides, also referred to as Migita-coupling. Until recently aryl bromides and iodides were typically employed as electrophiles rather than the less reactive but abundant aryl chlorides. In comparison to aryl (pseudo)halides, alkenyl electrophiles have been much less systematically explored. One of the disadvantages of halides is the synthesis of not commercially available substrates, which may require multiple steps , forcing reaction conditions 10 restricting the functional group tolerance, as well as toxic chemicals (e.g. CCl4, 11 PCl5 12 ). In contrast, aryl and alkenyl triflates, representatives of pseudohalides, can easily be synthesized in a simple one step procedure from phenols and ketones, rendering them excellent alternative electrophiles. Phenols and ketones are both abundant, available as well as low-cost, and thus attractive building blocks, especially for more complex pharmaceutically active compounds.

The activation of the precatalyst, which is structurally related to the product of the oxidative addition, occurs via the same steps as the catalytic reaction (coordination of thiol, deprotonation and reductive elimination of the thioether). Interestingly, the reaction progress comparison of different electrophiles showed that aryl triflates not only have the highest reaction rate, but also the shortest induction period < 5 minutes (Scheme 6).

Their applications are often hindered, however, by poor solubilities that result from their extended, solvophobic aromatic surfaces. Attempts to counteract this problem by functionalizing their peripheries have been met with only limited success. Here, we demonstrate a versatile strategy to tune the physical and electronic properties of porphyrins using an axial functionalization approach. Porphyrin silanes (PorSils) and bissilyloxy PorSils (SOPS) are prepared from porphyrins by operationally simple κ 4 N-silylation protocols, introducing bulky silyloxy ""caps"" that are central and perpendicular to the planar porphyrin. While porphyrins typically form either J-or H-aggregates, SOPS do not self-associate in the same manner: the silyloxy axial substituents dramatically improve solubility by inhibiting aggregation. Moreover, axial porphyrin functionalization offers convenient handles through which optical, electronic, and structural properties of the porphyrin core can be modulated. We observe that the identity of the silyloxy substituent impacts the degree of planarity of the porphyrin in the solid state as well as the redox potentials.', 'RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSynthesis and Reactivity of PorSils and SOPS. Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP, 2) was synthesized by the Adler-Longo method. 3b Previous methodology for accessing PorSils relied on the use of a highly reactive lithium amide to deprotonate the porphyrin prior to reaction with HSiCl3, which was found to be a better porphyrin silylating reagent than the perhaps more intuitive building block SiCl4. Sun and co-workers found that porphyrin silylation could be accomplished by combining the porphyrin and HSiCl3 in the presence of Pr3N. They relied on chromatography to purify the resulting TPP-Si(Cl)2 (2-SiCl2), an inefficient approach that also notably did not work in our hands as the modified porphyrin covalently reacted with the solid support. We accomplished the silylation of 2 using HSiCl3 with Et3N, a common laboratory reagent (Scheme 1). After aqueous workup, residual Et3N can be readily removed by evaporation. Using this method we were able to avoid the necessity for chromatography, and instead were able to isolate our desired product by simple liquid-liquid extraction, resulting in up to an 85% yield of 2-SiCl2. The generalization of this reaction in combination with the simplification of the purification procedure are steps forward for the prospects of developing this class of molecules. To synthesize the SOPS, 2-SiCl2 was converted quantitively to 3 by refluxing in a THF/water mixture, and subsequently silylated using Et3N and the respective silyl chloride (Scheme 1). These final compounds were air-stable and purified by column chromatography using silica gel and alkaline eluents (see Supporting Information); large scale purification could be accomplished by recrystallization.It is worth commenting on the more practical aspects of this synthesis, particularly in reference to key intermediate', 'this approach have recently been explored to improve photophysical and electrochemical performance. Phthalocyanines (Pcs) have been used for many of the same applications as porphyrin compounds. Like porphyrins, Pcs are planar and suffer from poor solubilities. However, an elegant approach to improve their physical properties has been to silylate the center of the Pc, introducing axially oriented groups that shield the aromatic surface. Beyond its effect on solubility, silylation modifies the optical and electronic profiles of Pcs, which has led to over 1000 papers discussing the synthesis, properties, and applications of silylated Pcs (Si-Pcs). Curiously, however, there is a relative dearth of literature describing such functionalization of the parent porphyrin compounds, which is presumably due to the relatively harsh conditions and operationally complex protocols used to incorporate the central silicon atom. While Si-Pcs are formed in the presence of SiCl4 to i) template the macrocyclization and ii) silylate in situ, porphyrin silanes (PorSils) have been synthesized by first making the porphyrin and then inserting the silicon by forming the [porphyrin] 2-species with a strong and difficult-to-handle amide base under strictly anhydrous conditions. Sun and co-workers were able to silylate two porphyrins using HSiCl3 and a tertiary amine base. However, purification of the resulting PorSil dichloride requires chromatography on neutral alumina, which makes the protocol too inefficient and expensive to be applied as a general method on a large scale. Furthermore, this protocol can be difficult to reproduce as the PorSil dichloride can react with the alumina sorbent via nucleophilic substitution of a chloride.This lack of', 'on the more practical aspects of this synthesis, particularly in reference to key intermediate 2-SiCl2.While stable in open air and during neutral aqueous workup, the Si-Cl bonds in the PorSil are labile enough that reaction quickly and quantitatively occurs between 2-Si(Cl)2 and silica gel (in both column and thin-layer chromatography (TLC)). Neither the precursor (2) nor subsequent product (3) display such reactivity. This allows for facile tracking of reaction progress in either the generation of 2-SiCl2 from 2 or consumption of 2-SiCl2 to make 3, as 2-SiCl2 is completely immobile on a silica TLC plate. NMR Analysis. The NMR spectra of the synthesized SOPS provide insight into the structural and electronic characteristics of these molecules (Figure ). The quadrupole of the aromatic porphyrin shields the alkyl/aryl protons of the silyloxy axial substituents resulting in marked upfield shifts of these signals. This was not unexpected: N-H protons in 2 -which also lie in the shielded porphyrin core -are observed at -2.75 ppm and similar upfield shifts are observed for axial substituents in related PorSils and SiPcs. This shielding falls off with distance from the silane (and thus the center of the quadrupole); for example, in TPP-Si(OSiPh3)2 (1i), the signal for the ortho protons (HE) is visible at 4.69 ppm, significantly upfield from the usual aromatic region, and the signal for the meta protons (HF) is observed at 6.57 ppm (Figure ). An additional consequence is that while phenylsilanes typically have overlapping signals for the meta (HF) and para (HG) protons, such protons in these compounds (i.e. 1f-i) are completely resolved, with Δδ of 0.26-0.32 ppm. A similar effect is observed in the 13 C NMR spectra, with significant upfield shifts observed for the axial silane substituents (see', 'CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKEdge-functionalized porphyrin derivatives are reliable and widely used building blocks for functional organic materials. We have demonstrated that the straightforward, high-yielding modification of porphyrins at their core is a viable alternative way to tune their properties. By silylating the porphyrin and capping with axial silyloxy substituents, we have increased porphyrin solubility and prevented aggregation-induced physicochemical phenomena. The identity of the silyloxy cap can be used to tune porphyrin planarity and molecular orbital energies. This approach offers opportunities for the customization of porphyrins through axial tuning and an improvement in the processability of porphyrins via increased solubility.

The calculations we performed so far show that BioMetAll implicitly takes into account the changes in the metal position that those exogenous ligands could cause (as showed latter in the manuscript).', 'of mutations. This run of BioMetAll looking for possible sites allowing a mutation to either Asp or Glu provided with an extensive list of possible solutions including Asn131 (Table ). The following step was a post-process by filtering the solutions that show collapse between the probes and any amino acid side chain or backbone from close neighbors of the putative metal-binding areas. This filtering process together with a visual inspection diminished the number of possibilities to five candidates (Table and Figure ).To further assess the predictiveness of BioMetAll under a metalloenzyme design framework, the predicted systems were used as a starting point for docking experiments. Calculations were carried out with the protein-ligand docking software GOLD software and repeated inside our GaudiMM platform (to provide with a freeware alternative). Both calculations were performed The predictiveness of BioMetAll is excellent and compares very well with other algorithms when it comes to determine metal-binding sites as well as the exact list of the amino acids involved in the coordination motifs. Those predictions are of good quality even when exogenous compounds are involved. BioMetAll tests on several key systems show that i) it efficiently predicts primary as well as secondary metal-binding sites, ii) it can easily account on how the conformational changes of the protein could alter the formation of metal-binding sites, iii) it allows to work with common metal-binding templates as well as non-standard ones, iv) it identifies sites even with incomplete coordination spheres, and v) it allows to predict mutations that could be necessary to generate new metal-binding sites in a protein', 'BioMetAll: Identifying Metal-Binding Sites in Proteins from Backbone Preorganization With a large amount of research dedicated to decoding how metallic species bind to protein, in silico methods are interesting allies for experimental procedures. To date, computational predictors mostly work by identifying the best possible sequence or structural match of the target protein with metal binding templates. These approaches are fundamentally focused on the first coordination sphere of the metal. Here, we present the BioMetAll predictor that is based on a different postulate: the formation of a potential metal-binding site is related to the geometric organization of the protein backbone. We first report the set of convenient geometric descriptors of the backbone needed for the algorithm and their parametrization from a statistical analysis. Then, the successful benchmark of BioMetAll on a set of more than 50 metal-binding X-Ray structures is presented. Because BioMetAll allows structural predictions regardless of the exact geometry of the side chains, it appears extremely valuable for systems which structures (either experimental or theoretical) are not optimal for metal binding sites. We report here its application on three different challenging cases i) the modulation of metal-binding sites during conformational transition in human serum albumin, ii) the identification of possible routes of metal migration in hemocyanins, and iii) the prediction of mutations to generate convenient metal-binding sites for de novo biocatalysts. This study shows that BioMetAll offers a versatile platform for numerous fields of research at the interface between inorganic chemistry and biology, and allows to highlight the role of the preorganization of the protein backbone as a marker for metal binding.', 'of the X-ray structures to be found in the most populated solution only with the complete set of amino acids, success rate falls to 40%. Obviously, like for other techniques based on empirical scores, the predictiveness of the method cannot be limited to the best solution only and those secondary metal binding sites that BioMetAll detects are not necessarily false positives but transient metallic environments accessible to the protein (see our first application case on HSA). Energetic terms and other physico-chemical magnitudes that are not present in BioMetAll, could dictate the fine structure of the metal-binding site. Posterior filtering could be necessary depending on the objective of its use.The accuracy of the predicted binding area was further assessed by measuring the distance from the experimental metal position to the nearest computed probe. On average a difference between calculated and experimental positions of the metal is about 0.56 ± 0.19 Å. Importantly, such quality is not influenced by the presence of donors coordinated to the metal provided by exogenous compounds (e.g. phosphate or water molecules). In these cases, we generally observe a displacement to the limits of the predicted region (Figure ), suggesting that the exogenous donors only slightly modify the position of the metal and the organization of the side chains.Because calculations are performed in a blind manner, meaning that all the system is screened for predicting metal-binding sites, these results are quite remarkable. Regarding the computational cost of the calculations, they range from 3s to 245s, with a median of 18s (with the size of the system highly correlating with the computational time r=0.89, p<0.0001).The benchmark shows that BioMetAll is a suitable software to predict metal-binding sites. One can readily perform screening of protein structures in a rational enzyme design protocol or testing a set of', 'Computational methodology The conceptBioMetAll relies on the assumption that the geometric patterns of the backbone of a given protein environment encode sufficient information on its preorganization to coordinate metal ions. By doing so, predictions are less conditioned by finding perfect matches and so could detect those binding sites that are partially organized (e.g. missing one or several well-positioned side chains) or even help in designing new metal coordination environment throughout mutations (e.g. for application in enzyme design).BioMetAll prediction works by embedding a protein in a grid of fictitious metal probes, which are further evaluated using geometric features obtained for each amino acid by statistical analysis. The entire set of geometric parameters is divided in two: one for coordinating atoms being part of the side chains and the other for atoms being part of the backbone. For side chains, the geometric features are (Figure ): Ma, the distance from the metal to the ⍺carbon; Mb, the distance from the metal to the β-carbon; and Mab, the angle between the metal, the ⍺-carbon and the β-carbon. For backbone oxygen atoms (Figure ): MO, the distance from the metal to the backbone oxygen; and MOC, the angle between the metal, the backbone oxygen and the backbone carbon.']","['Metal organic frameworks', 'Catalytic applications']",1447,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9730981146137956,0.0,['why']
93,"the context of the mode following (MF) approaches discussed above, this can be understood because anharmonic torsional modes describe the transition between low-lying conformations. Although entropies and heat capacities are thermodynamic features encoded rather globally in the shape of the PES , conformations can be used to map the problem to well-defined points on the PES. More specifically, part of the absolute entropy is computed by an informational thermostatistic partition function (Gibbs-Shannon entropy ) that only depends on a given Boltzmann probability distribution of the conformers. This idea was pursued in the so-called ""minima mining"" approaches, where effects of anharmonicities are partially absorbed into the conformational entropy. As for the MF methods, a wide variety of different schemes exist, such as the so-called mutual information expansion (MIE) , or the maximum information spanning tree (MIST) procedures. More recent developments were introduced by Suárez and coworkers.

This partitioning of the entropy into vibrational and conformational parts was first introduced by Karplus et al., and has since been used in many studies. A well-known problem of RRHO-based entropy calculations is that S vib tends to infinity for vibrational frequencies approaching zero. In actual calculations for larger, flexible molecules, many low-frequency vibrational modes appear which are often better characterized by internal rotations of functional groups rather than by stretching or bending vibrations. They are in a typical range of 5-50 cm -1 and can spoil the computed entropy due to artificial numerical errors and their strong anharmonicity components. Correction schemes exist which explicitly treat such modes anharmonically in a coupled or uncoupled form . These methods require the costly computation of one-dimensional (1D) PES as well as definition of special internal coordinates. In our opinion, while such methods can be beneficial and accurate for small to medium sized and not too flexible molecules (≈ 20-30 atoms), they are not viable for a robust and rather general treatment for systems with hundreds of atoms.In 2012, one of us proposed to modify the treatment of the low-frequency part of the vibrational spectrum by taking a so-called rotor-approximation and continuously interpolating between a rigid-rotor and vibrational description for each mode. Herein, the vibrational entropy of a harmonic oscillator with frequency ν at temperature T', 'ConclusionsAn automated workflow for the calculation of absolute molecular entropies is presented.The molecular entropy is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity necessary for a complete understanding of molecular interactions. The main component of the absolute entropy is usually obtained from vibrational frequency calculations in the RRHO approximation, which for medium sized molecules (50-100 atoms) often underestimates anharmonicities for lowfrequency modes and is missing configurational contributions arising from many accessible low-energy conformations. In the presented approach both sources of error are treated by a separation of the molecular entropy into a configurational (conformational) part and the entropy arising from translational, rotational, and vibrational degrees of freedom. For the latter, vibrational freuqncies were obtained at the B97-3c and B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP DFT level, employing a modified and scaled RRHO approximation (termed msRRHO) with two adjustable parameters τ and ν scal . The conformational entropy is calculated from an ensemble of conformers using the well known Gibbs-Shannon entropy formula (S conf ) and an population average over indidual msRRHO contributions of the conformers (S msRRHO ). We here make use of the fast and accurate GFN-FF and GFN2-xTB methods for the generation and energetic ranking of structures, driven by the recently introduced CREST program. The entire procedure is designed to work with only a few simple steps and minimal user input, which makes it routinely applicable to a broad range of systems.The presented workflow was tested on a set of 62 experimental molecular gas phase en-tropies. An excellent performance (better than the chemical accuracy of 3 cal mol -1 K -1 ) was observed with MADs ranging from 0.73 to 0.92 cal mol -1 K -1 and SDs from 1.08 to 1.30 cal mol -1 K -1 respectively, depending on the combination of the DFT', 'is unable to account for all of the missing contributions to the entropy.Approaches that compute the absolute entropy can be roughly categorized into two major classes. The first go beyond the HO approximation and explicitly account for anharmonicities in the description mainly for low-frequency, torsional normal modes. For example, this can be done by construction of one-dimensional (1D) potential energy surfaces (PES) along the respective normal modes, as in the uncoupled normal mode approach of Sauer and coworkers. This scheme was later adapted by Head-Gordon et al. to include a separate treatment of vibrational and torsional modes (UM-VT). Advances have also been made for approaches that investigate coupled torsional motions. Another method that includes the torsional anharmonicity via 1D-PES and takes multiple structures into account is the MS-T approach (and its variants), developed by Truhlar and coworkers. Good results can be achieved with all of the above schemes, but in practice the construction of the PES and the relevant modes is technically involved, often only possible for relatively small molecules and unfeasible for routine computational chemistry workflows.A stronger focus on multiple minima (molecular configurations/conformers) leads to the second class of approaches. Here, thermodynamic properties are approximated only by considering the unique minima on the PES, which in the molecular case are the different conformations. In the context of the mode following (MF) approaches discussed above, this can be understood because', 'quantities are obtained from snapshots along an extended molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory, which are associated with unique molecular conformations. The vibrational contributions are averaged over all snapshots, while the configurational entropy is calculated via an MIE. This is doable at a force-field (FF) level, but will become cumbersome for medium sized drug-like molecules at higher theoretical levels.Note that essential parts of these schemes depend solely on structure based descriptors (dihedral angles). Other studies in the literature, employ some kind of flexibility measure to empirically derive molecular entropies and even more recently Hutchison et al. have used structural descriptors to develop a promising machine learned estimation of conformational entropy. In this study, we introduce an improved scheme that is developed from the minima mining approach and is designed to work in an almost ""black box"" fashion in combination with modified RRHO calculations. Herein, for the calculation of conformational entropies the recently developed GFN2-xTB tight-binding MO and GFN-FF force-field methods are employed to keep computational cost under control and improve the PES description in comparison to many standard FFs. Both methods are consistently available for all elements in the periodic table up to radon (Z=86). Below, we will first start with a general overview of the partitioning of entropies and heat capacities, followed by a description of technical novelties and the automated procedure used for the conformational part. After discussing general observations with regard to entropy calculations, benchmark results for entropies and heat capacities are presented in comparison with experimental gas phase values.

The 8 \uf06dm PES separator membrane has a mildly asymmetric pore profile across its thickness. One side has fewer and smaller pores (the 'gloss' side) than the other side (the 'matt' side). As conventional alkaline electrolysis cells are generally known to produce smaller bubbles of hydrogen than oxygen, the gloss side of the separator membrane was placed facing the hydrogen-generating cathode with the matt side facing the oxygen-generating anode.The cell, thus assembled, was then placed on a stand in a large beaker that was onethird filled with aqueous 6 M KOH (which we called a 'reservoir beaker').

Very similar resultswere obtained for the two techniques, with little bubble formation observed up to 0.17-0.20 A cm -2 . At higher current densities, up to around 0.6 A cm -2 , bubbles were formed predominantly at the cathode. Given that commercial alkaline electrolysers typically operate at current densities up to 0.6 A cm -2 , this suggests that minimizing bubble formation at the cathode offers the key opportunity for further performance improvements in the capillary-fed cell. The cathode and anode produced bubbles at similar rates at still higher current densities, to 1 A cm-2. Even at 1 A cm -2 , the rate of bubble formation on the electrodes was substantially lower than in conventional, 'bubbled' electrolysis cells. In the course of this work, the previously reported high electrochemical performance of the capillary-fed cell was independently confirmed.    IndependentFigure 1 .1Figure 1.

A transparent, acrylic second-generation cell of the above type was modified by drilling a 6 mm wide hole from the top of the cell to the electrolyte reservoir cavity as shown in Figure . A Hg/HgO reference electrode was then introduced into the resulting cavity, such that its active end was immersed in the liquid electrolyte in the reservoir. The electrical connections were then made as described above, with the cell or its contents maintained under an inert Ar atmosphere.A disadvantage of this alternative arrangement was that even moderate evaporation during an experiment could change the molarity of the KOH electrolyte, thereby changing the area-specific resistance (ASR) between the electrodes and altering the cell performance.Nevertheless, the cell could be used successfully if experiments were carried out quickly and carefully. A set-up similar to this, with the reference electrode holes excluded, was used for all acoustic emission testing. In accordance with the voltage fluctuation technique described previously, 10 the standard deviation, \uf073, of the voltage data at each of the anode and cathode was calculated over the last 10 s of each 20 s step period and plotted against the respective current density. Low values of \uf073 were typically associated with bubble-free gas generation (e.g. less than \uf073 ~0.2 mV), while higher values (e.g. more than \uf073 ~0.2 mV) were consistent with bubble formation.For acoustic emission studies, all electrochemical tests were conducted using an Interface 5000 potentiostat (Gamry, U.S.A.) with the electrical connections set-up as shown in Figure <ref type=""figure""', ""recently, a novel class of 'bubble-free' electrolysis cell, known as a capillary-fed cell, has been developed. In such cells, the gases are produced in bulk form directly from the liquid electrolyte that lightly, but completely, coats the electrodes. A thin, wicking separator between the electrodes draws the alkaline liquid electrolyte up to the electrodes from a reservoir at the base of the cell. The electrodes, which are sandwiched tightly against opposite sides of the separator in a zero-gap configuration, draw small amounts of liquid electrolyte laterally out of the separator causing them to be completely covered with only a thin layer of the liquid electrolyte. The gas formed on the electrode surface can then migrate through the thin layer of liquid electrolyte into an adjoining gas chamber, without forming gas bubbles. The outcome of this arrangement is that the energy efficiency of the cell is significantly improved. Indeed, a capillary-fed water electrolysis cell has been reported that requires only 40.4 kWh to produce 1 kg of hydrogen under the standard operating conditions employed in many commercial alkaline electrolyzers. This supersedes the efficiency target of <42 kWh kg -1 set by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) for the year 2050. While the above capillary-fed cell is essentially bubble-free at low current densities, some gas bubbles are produced at higher current densities. This is likely because one or both electrodes become overhydrated; that is the layer of liquid electrolyte on the surface of the electrodes becomes too thick. For example, water is produced at the oxygen-generating anode in alkaline electrolysis cells. At higher current densities the quantity of water produced in the capillary-fed alkaline cell may conceivably thicken the liquid layer on the anode, slowing the migration of the oxygen gas product""]","['Energy', 'Renewable energy sources']",1775,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"['the', 'which']"

878,"Probing Interfacial Effects on Ionization Energies: The Surprising Banality of Anion-Water Hydrogen Bonding at the Air/Water Interface Liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy is an increasingly common technique to measure vertical ionization energies (VIEs) of aqueous solutes, although the interpretation of these experiments is subject to questions regarding sensitivity to bulk versus interfacial solvation environments. Here, we compute aqueous-phase VIEs for a set of inorganic anions, some of which partition preferentially at the air/water interface, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. The results are in excellent agreement with experiment, regardless of whether the simulation data are restricted to ions at the air/water interface or to those in bulk liquid water. Although the computed VIEs are sensitive to ion-water hydrogen bonding, we find that the short-range solvation structure is sufficiently similar in the bulk and interfacial environments that it proves impossible to discriminate between the two on the basis of the VIE, a conclusion that has important implications for the interpretation of liquid-phase photoelectron spectroscopy.

This idea has been put forward previously with regard to I -(aq), 141 IO - 3 (aq), and SCN -(aq), 144 and in particular the structural anisotropy around I -(aq) that is reported in Ref. 141 is reproduced by the simulations reported here; see Fig. . As such, the airexposed configurations of the interfacial ion are not solvated very differently as compared to the same ion in bulk water. Other studies have also pointed to asymmetric solvation environments around anions (more so than cations), even in bulk water. Our results suggest that the solvation environments of various soft anions are asymmetric both in bulk water and at the air/water interface, leading to VIEs that are essentially indistinguishable.the VIEs of these species in water, is mostly performed at photon energies where the attenuation length of the outgoing photoelectron is 1-10 nm, suggesting that the experiments are more sensitive to solutes at the interface. However, there has been little prior investigation of whether the VIEs themselves are sensitive to interfacial solvation, which is an especially relevant question for soft anions that are known to partition preferentially at the air/water interface. Our calculations suggest that differences between bulk and interfacial VIEs are inconsequential, which we attribute to similarities in first-shell hydration structure in both environments. These striking similarities serve as a reminder that although the structure of the air/water interface may be modified by the presence of dissolved ions, the hydration shell around a given solute may or may not be different than what it is bulk aqueous solution. Whereas liquid microjet', 'solute may or may not be different than what it is bulk aqueous solution. Whereas liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy may be surface-sensitive, our results strongly suggest that the observable that it measures is not surface-sensitive.This work also reports a new computational protocol for aqueous VIEs. The existing conventional wisdom is that a prohibitively large number of explicit water molecules is needed to obtain converged VIEs in aqueous solution, but with an appropriate choice of continuum boundary conditions we find that convergence is achieved with two solvation shells. VIEs reported here are within 0.2-0.3 eV of experimental values, even for polyvalent anions. This is comparable to the accuracy of the best existing periodic DFT calculations of the same quantities, but without the complexities posed by the periodic treatment when the number of electrons changes. The protocol reported here is also readily extensible to wave function-based quantum chemistry.Rapid convergence of the VIE in our cluster-continuum protocol suggests that this quantity is mostly sensitive to short-range solvation structure, with the continuum boundary conditions making a large but non-specific contribution at longer range. Similarities in bulk and interfacial VIEs result from similarities in the short-range hydration environment. Our', 'Results and DiscussionA. Comparison to Experiment. By tuning the photon energy and thereby the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons, 63 liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to measure the concentration profile (versus depth) of ions at the air/water interface. In other measurements, the concentration dependence of the photoelectron yield of aqueous aniline was found to correlate with the surface concentration inferred from surface tension measurements. If the ionwater hydrogen bonds are different at the interface as compared to those in bulk water, then the VIE might provide a probe of these structural changes. Indeed, comparison of the valence photoelectron spectra of the liquid and vapor phases of water suggests that spectral shifts engendered by hydrogen bonding are different depending on the orbital that is ionized, and the convergence tests VIEs for aqueous anions computed from bulk (isotropic) and interfacial (slab) simulations, in comparison to experimental VIEs from Ref. 86. The diagonal line indicates agreement between theory and experiment. Calculations were performed at the ωB97M-V level using nonequilibrium PEqS boundary conditions, and each data point represents an average over 51 snapshots extracted from the MD simulation. The corresponding numerical data are provided in Table .in Fig. indicate that the VIE is sensitive to short-range ion-water hydrogen bonding. There has been little effort to investigate interfacial effects on VIEs, however, except in the special case of e -(aq), and in one preliminary', ' and ultraviolet spectroscopy of small aqueous solutes have been demonstrated, there has been no systematic investigation of whether VIEs themselves are sensitive to the presence of the air/water interface; the only detailed studies concern the rather unique case of the hydrated electron. It is known that the VIE of liquid water is largely unaffected by dissolved ions, shifting by < 0.2 eV over an 8 M concentration range, and the VIE of I -(aq) is similarly unaffected by concentration. It is not yet known whether VIEs of aqueous ions are sensitive to the air/water interface or not.That issue is examined here by computing bulk and interfacial VIEs for 16 common inorganic ions for which experimental data (from liquid microjets) are available, using a combination of MD simulations and electronic structure calculations. Long-range polarization makes a significant contribution to VIEs in water, and we incorporate this effect via dielectric continuum boundary', 'in bulk and interfacial VIEs result from similarities in the short-range hydration environment. Our results are therefore consistent with the presumed surface-sensitivity of liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy, but also reveal that these values can likely be taken seriously as VIEs for bulk aqueous solutes. The latter are important parameters for the solution-phase theory of electron transfer. Observed similarities in the solvation structure of bulk versus interfacial anions sets up another interesting conundrum, namely, how to reconcile these observations with shifts in the O-H stretching band of water are detected (using surface-selective vibrational spectroscopy) when soft ions are present at the air/water interface. Our results suggest that this is likely a second-shell (or possibly third-shell) solvation effect, resulting from subtle changes in the network of waterwater hydrogen bonds that are induced by the presence of the ion, rather than resulting directly from changes in ion-water hydrogen bonds at the interface. The surface sensitivity of soft anions is itself known to be a rather subtle effect, difficult to ascribe to changes in any single energetic term in the interaction potential, and at least partly driven by entropic considerations.

Simple examples of this importance are found in common metal oxo motifs in metalloenzymes, ranging from the iron-based cytochrome P450 enzymes and methane monooxygenases to molybdenum-based sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. Each of these systems carry out specific chemical reactions that harness high-energy M=O motifs and enable oxidations that would not occur with molecular oxygen alone. Moving down one row in the periodic table, sulfur also plays key roles in biology, particularly during most of Earth's history that was devoid of atmospheric oxygen. For example, the low solubility of metal sulfides helps to potentiate the bioavailability of metals dissolved in oceans and other bodies of water. Similarly, sulfide lowers heavy metal ion toxicity in archaea native to hyperthermophilic vent environments, which were likely early locales capable of supporting life. These reducing environments devoid of oxygen but rich in sulfur provided a home for early chemolithoautotrophic and sulfur-reducing microorganisms that likely built the cornerstones of bioinorganic metal-chalcogen chemistry still found today in modern biology.Under such prebiotic conditions, carbon-containing sulfur compounds, such as carbonyl sulfide (COS), have also been hypothesized to play important roles in developing molecular complexity. For example, COS is the most prevalent sulfur-containing gas in Earth's atmosphere and is often found at elevated concentrations near volcanoes and hot springs.

The truncation to a finite basis assumes that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are ordered so that from a certain value of N and on it is the case that . As is well known, a finite spectral expansion is the best approximation for the density matrix in the sense of a minimal norm of the error squared . For such values of the temperature that the numerical rank of the density matrix is lower than N. At a sufficiently high , low temperature, and assuming a finite gap between a non-degenerate ground and lowest excited state, one can reduce the numerical rank towards unity. In this limit the density tends to that of a pure (ground) state. At a low rank it is numerically not practical to go from the density to its surprisal. The other direction, to determine the density from its surprisal, is possible at all temperatures.The eigenstates that diagonalize the density matrix will also diagonalize the matrix of the surprisal. This enables a simple transformation of the time-dependent surprisal to the density matrix. When it is a thermal initial state the eigenstates at the initial time correspond to the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian . As the dynamics unfolds the eigenstates need to be determined by diagonalization of the surprisal. In this paper we assume that the system is isolated in the sense that it is not interacting with its environment. The time evolution', 'B.

We seek the density that is of maximal entropy given the constraint that the density is normalized and is consistent with the mean values of Hermitian observables indexed by k. It is convenient to include a k = 0 term as the condition of normalization, or .In the specific example of a thermal state, the mean energy of the system, , plays a role of the only constraint, besides normalization.

( <ref', 'two other derivations of a density matrix that also are of an exponential form like Eq. ( ) but where the motivation is tightly connected to the dynamics. In a theoretical or computational discussion, one often initiates the dynamics from a pure state. But in reality, the initial state is often a mixture and then it makes sense to start from an initial density of maximal entropy subject to those constraints that govern the yet unperturbed state,. For such an initial state we now show that the exact time evolution of the density or of the surprisal is described with a finite number of time-dependent constraints with time independent Lagrange multipliers. The proof requires the unitarity of the time evolution operator and a series expansion of the exponential:(The time-dependent constraints are the terms in the curly brackets, and there are as many time-dependent constraints as the number of constraints in the initial state. In section III we discuss how to compute directly the surprisal:The method of computing the surprisal can also be applied should we wish to obtain explicit expressions for the individual time-dependent constraints.We next come to a simpler but more specialized result. It is valid for the special case when the dynamics of the constraints are closed under commutation relation with the Hamiltonian.In such a limiting situation the exact time evolution can be described with a finite number of time-independent constraints but with time dependent Lagrange multipliers with known equations of motion.

This approximate treatment follows the spirit of the information theory approach -description of the density matrix using only a partial but essential knowledge about the system.To discuss systems with more than a few degrees of freedom a large basis is needed for numerical convergence. So exact propagation of the surprisal on a finite basis will be computationally demanding. However, the dynamics of the Lagrange multipliers of the dominant constraints may be sufficient for most purposes. This opens a different way of approximating the quantum dynamics in many-body systems, a subject for future research.In section II we show that if the initial state of a system is described as a state of maximal entropy, a finite set of time-dependent constraints is sufficient to reproduce the surprisal at all subsequent times. During a unitary time-evolution the rank of the density matrix is conserved so the number of the time-dependent constraints is the same as the number of constraints on the initial state. In section II we further describe the special circumstances where an algebraically delineated finite set of time-independent constraints is sufficient to describe the dynamics. The algebraic procedure to convert the dynamics of the surprisal to a compact evolution of the Lagrange multipliers is introduced. Section III discusses the proposed computational scheme for an exact dynamical evolution of the surprisal in a finite dimensional space.

958,"Wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia and economic indicatorsAn essential economic indicator for evaluating the economic feasibility of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production is the discount rate. The discount rate represents the rate of return used to evaluate the present value and cash flow of a project.The chosen discount rate depends on the inflation rate, risk, and the funding source, with government funding having lower discount rates than private funding. The determination of an appropriate discount rate is complex, requiring a holistic approach that considers market distortions caused by subsidies, the technicalities of integrating renewables into existing systems, and the social implications of community involvement. Moreover, it necessitates a comprehensive analysis of various factors, including interest rates, expected returns, the time frame of the analysis, and risk premiums, while also adapting to extraordinary conditions such as pandemics, global conflicts, climate issues, and other unique challenges associated with renewable energy projects.

We combine this with a multi-objective optimization to determine the optimal wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production locations to match the global fertilizer demand from agriculture. We focus on meeting the demand for agricultural fertilizers while minimizing production costs, distribution costs, and water stress at the production sites.We highlight the potential of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production as a renewable and decentralized alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. We show that to match the highest market price in the last 5 years (∼ 1,600 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 25% and capital costs below 900 USD/kW, energy efficiencies above 20% and capital costs below 550 USD/kW, or energy efficiencies above 15% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW. If the price of the ammonia market recovers to the lowest market price in the last 5 years, the technologies must achieve energy efficiency greater than 70% and capital costs lower than 200 USD/kW. With the increasing uncertainty of natural gas prices, wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production could become an economical alternative that could decouple natural gas from ammonia production.Additionally, we address the importance of discount rates on the ammonia production cost, distribution distance, and optimal decentralization level. The chosen discount rate is influenced by factors such as inflation, risk, and funding sources, with government funding typically resulting in lower discount rates compared to private funding. Higher discount', 'funding typically resulting in lower discount rates compared to private funding. Higher discount rates lead to higher ammonia costs, longer distribution distances, larger regional production capacities, and a lower number of production regions. Conversely, lower discount rates result in lower ammonia costs, shorter distribution distances, smaller regional production capacities, and a higher number of production regions. For instance, a low discount rate of 3% results in ammonia costs between 540 USD/t N H 3 and 950 USD/t N H 3 and distribution distances between 510 km and 1,020 km, while a high discount rate of 10% results in ammonia costs between 680 USD/t N H 3 and 1,230 USD/t N H 3 and distribution distances between 660 km and 1,400 km. To facilitate the transition towards renewable and decentralized ammonia production, it is crucial for governments and entities to offer funding programs with lower discount rates.We also address the complex interaction between the emerging wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production industry and existing water infrastructure. Our results show that it is possible to create wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production infrastructure to meet global fertilizer demand while maintaining competitive costs and low water stress. When prioritizing water over cost, it is possible to reduce the average water stress by 99% with only a 1.4% increase in ammonia costs.Our results highlight the benefits of a decarbonized and decentralized ammonia supply chain by showing that the decentralization of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production leads to reduced levels of price sensitivity. With the price of agricultural commodities rising rapidly, the current system of ammonia production places unnecessary strain on global food security due to its susceptibility to volatility in energy prices. The ammonia produced by the Haber-Bosch process is', 'effect, increasing the present value of future cash flows, leading to more decentralized systems that have higher capital costs but lower operating costs. An analysis of three capital cost scenarios evaluates the effect of the discount rate on the average ammonia cost, average distribution distance, optimal number of production regions, and average regional production capacity. Higher discount rates lead to higher ammonia costs, higher distribution distances, higher average regional capacity, and a lower number of production regions.A low discount rate, here considered to be 3%, results in an average ammonia cost of 540 USD/t N H 3 for the low capital cost scenario and 950 USD/t N H 3 for the high capital cost scenario (Figure ). The optimal ammonia production and distribution network consists of 1,015 regional production facilities (Figure ) with an average distribution distance of 510 km (Figure ) and an average regional production capacity of 950 metric tons of ammonia per day (Figure ) for the low capital cost scenario. For the high capital cost scenario, the optimal production and distribution network results in 127 regional production facilities with an average distribution distance of 1,020 km and an average regional production capacity of 7,600 tons of ammonia per day.A medium discount rate, here considered to be 7%, results in an average ammonia cost of 620 USD/t N H 3 for the low capital cost scenario and 1,100 USD/t N H 3 for the high capital cost scenario (Figure ).

All of these challenges with modern ammonia manufacturing, inequity, lack of access, price volatility, and carbon emissions have motivated interest in exploring decarbonized and decentralized approaches for fertilizer production. Here, we perform a techno-economic analysis that takes into consideration geospa-tial datasets to assess the feasibility of ammonia production systems driven by wind and photovoltaic electricity. We compare the cost of electrified Haber-Bosch facilities to that of more emerging electrolytic technologies. When determining the spatial distribution of costs, we also take into consideration key technical, economic, and environmental conditions that can impact wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies. Then, we set energy efficiency and capital cost targets to meet the ammonia market prices. Finally, we optimize the ammonia production infrastructure driven by wind and photovoltaic electricity to minimize the impact changes in transportation costs have on the cost of ammonia, while also ensuring that ammonia production does not contribute to regional water stress.', 'cost scenario (Figure ) -which is up to three times lower than the minimum distance between Haber-Bosch locations and farms. Thus, high-efficiency wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production systems are an essential requirement for the decentralized chemical manufacturing of fertilizers.To achieve an ammonia cost (production + distribution) under the highest market price in the last 5 years (∼ 1,600 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 25% and capital costs below 900 USD/kW, energy efficiencies above 20% and capital costs below 550 USD/kW, or energy efficiencies above 15% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW (Figure ). In contrast, to achieve an ammonia cost (production + distribution) under the lowest market price in the last 5 years (∼ 400 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 70% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW (Figure ). Note, however, that these prices do not take into consideration environmental externalities, geopolitics, and governmental-based subsidies.Therefore, improving the energy efficiency of state-of-the-art wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production systems over selectivity is the critical performance metric in order to achieve decentralized wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia. On that account, it might be prudent to focus policy and investments in research and development while the energy efficiencies remain low (EE < 40%), and then, transition policy-guided investments towards strategies to minimize ammonia costs through incentives, taxes, efficiency standards, and the scale-up of renewable ammonia production technologies.']","['Energy', 'Renewable energy sources']",1998,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.923604256863804,-2.220446049250313e-16,"['why', 'risk', 'and']"
256,"and the bimolecular rate constant would no longer be applicable. Using the rate constants fit to a system with aggregates would overestimate the rates at more dilute, diffusion-limited concentrations. The underestimation of triplet excitons at 8 mM by the Dover model is partially explained by the underestimation of SF and overestimation of excimer formation: if excimers predominantly result from aggregates and are absent at lower concentrations, then collisions at 8 mM are more likely to result in SF, and more triplet formation.Additionally, the presence of aggregates would explain the fast rate of triplet fusion at high TIPS-Tn concentration. If SF at 300 mM occurs on an aggregated pair of TIPS-Tn molecules, then the triplets are not well separated spatially and can recombine quickly. However, in a dilute solution with no aggregates, in which SF occurs during transient collisions, the molecules may diffuse away before the triplets recombine. Therefore the triplet fusion rate would be lower and a more significant amount of triplets would be observed. We note that the presence of aggregates at 300 mM does not affect the main conclusion of the study by Dover et al., i.e., that the excimer is a trap state rather than an intermediate. However, for the remainder of this study, we revert to the much simpler model shown in Eqs. ( ) and ( ) to describe SF in this system.As mentioned previously, we neglect the reverse SF process, triplet fusion, in this model. This assumption is justified in TIPS-Pn, as fusion is energetically uphill. For both TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn, the model fits well without triplet fusion, and so presumably it plays only a minor role. The other assumption made here is that the ISC rate is negligible compared to SF, but, as we show below, this assumption may not necessarily be the case.",Conditional,What happens if SF at 300 mM occurs on an aggregated pair of TIPS-Tn molecules?,The triplets are not well separated spatially and can recombine quickly.,Easy,"['If SF at 300 mM occurs on an aggregated pair of TIPS-Tn molecules, then the triplets are not well separated spatially and can recombine quickly.']","[[652, 796]]","['with the trend in the modeled data due to an increasing triplet population. The magnitude of this increase in the experimental data over 8 ns is about 2.3% of the GSB magnitude, which is approximately equivalent to 0.041 mOD. An upper bound of 0.049 mOD T 1 absorption is therefore a reasonable estimate.For TIPS-Tn, SF begins to produce the same amount of triplet excitons as the upper limit of ISC at a concentration of 2.1 mM. At 8 mM, this rate of ISC would account for 22% of triplets formed by 8 ns. So as with TIPS-Pn, the assumption of negligible ISC when fitting the bimolecular SF rate constant is potentially invalid. Refitting the deconvoluted concentrations of the 8 mM TA with an ISC rate constant of 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 , gives a bimolecular SF rate constant of (2.0 ± 0.6) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 (supplementary material Sec. S4. 3.3, Fig. 6(d)). Using this adjusted rate at 0.05 mM results in 2.7×10 -10 M of triplets formed due to SF, which is still substantially lower than the limit of detection, so an upper bound of 118 ns for ISC is still valid. As with TIPS-Pn, the 8 mM TIPS-Tn S 1 population decays faster and fits slightly better than without ISC. Given that 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 is an upper bound on the ISC rate constant, the range of bimolecular SF rate constants can now be considered to be between 1.4 × 10 9 M -1 s -1 (lower bound of T 1 concentration, upper bound of ISC) to 3.2×10 9 M -1 s -1 (upper bound of T 1 concentration, no ISC), or (2.3±0.9)×10 9 M -1 s -1 .We again note that, as for TIPS-Pn, the adjusted value of the SF rate constant does not affect the previously determined upper bound for the ISC rate constant. These results especially highlight the necessity to consider ISC when quantifying SF, even if it is assumed to be slow, as without doing so, the SF rate constant could potentially be overestimated.', 'on two commonly studied SF chromophores: 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-Pn) and 5,12-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) tetracene (TIPS-Tn).Several studies have previously reported ISC rates for TIPS-Pn that are inconsistent with experimental data. These rates correspond to time constants ranging from ns to µs, with some predicting observable quantities of triplets on timescales over which triplets have not been observed. These studies have often dismissed SF in dilute solutions and attributed triplet formation to ISC. For TIPS-Pn, we extend the work by Dvořák et al. to quantify diffusion-limited SF in dilute solutions, and show that SF can lead to observable quantities of triplet excitons for dilute solutions on ns time scales. We quantify an upper bound of the rate constant of ISC in TIPS-Pn and show that, conversely, discounting ISC can lead to an overestimate of SF.We also quantify the SF rate constant and the upper bound of the ISC rate constant in TIPS-Tn, and show that ISC is potentially faster, and even more important to consider for this molecule than for TIPS-Pn. We additionally note that excimer formation is not observed in dilute solutions of TIPS-Tn, even when SF is observed, and therefore suggest that previously observed excimer formation may be due to aggregate formation in concentrated solutions.', 'species such as a triplet-pair intermediate or excimer state is unnecessary to fit the data. This result is reasonable for SF in solution,as the triplet excitons are able to separate easily as molecules diffuse away from each other, and so any intermediate species would be short-lived. The extracted concentrations of S 1 and T 1 of TIPS-Pn from this fit are shown in Fig. (a). The lower bound of the triplet concentration comes from the upper bound of the T 1 basis spectrum. This result corresponds to the upper bound on the S 1 concentration. The yield of triplet excitons at 8 ns was calculated as c T 1 (8 ns)/c S 1 (0 ns) and is between 19 and 27%.For 8 mM TIPS-Tn, the deconvolution fits reproduce the TA data well at all wavelengths and times (Figs. S23 and S24 of the supplementary material). As with TIPS-Pn, a third component is unnecessary to fit the data at this concentration. This result is in apparent contradiction to TA data of TIPS-Tn in toluene by and Dover et al. , who resolved an excimer component from the TA data in addition to the triplet and singlet excitons. As will be discussed in more detail later, this disagreement is potentially explained by the significantly higher concentration of 300 mM used in these studies (37.5 times higher than the 8 mM solution used here). We speculate that this concentration may begin to approach the solubility limit of TIPS-Tn in toluene and result in the formation of aggregates in solution. Excimers potentially result from this aggregate formation, and are therefore undetected in more dilute solutions. The resulting concentrations of S 1 and T 1 are shown in Fig. 3(b), where the upper bound of T 1 and lower bound of S 1 concentrations correspond to the lower bound of the T 1 basis spectrum. The yield of triplets excitons at 8 ns for 8 mM TIPS-Tn is between 17 and 27%.', 'is due to excimer formation, rather than SF. Only about 3% of singlet excitons undergo SF to form T 1 . Additionally, a maximum T 1 yield of only 1.25% is observed, because most of the triplets formed rapidly undergo triplet fusion. A significant amount of excimer formation is predicted by the Dover model at 8 mM (34%), but, as discussed previously, the TA data fits well to just two components (S 1 and T 1 ) without additional absorption or emission that could be due to excimers. It is possible that the spectral component we assign to T 1 could instead be due to excimers, but, as we show in Fig. of the supplementary material, the spectral shape is consistent with previously assigned T 1 basis spectra. Additionally, the excimer state is emissive, but there is an absence of any obvious emission features in the basis spectrum that correspond to the excimer emission characterized by Dover et al.. Instead, we attribute the discrepancy between the Dover model and the TA data in this study to the concentrations of TIPS-Tn used. Both Dover et al. and Stern et al. used concentrations of 300 mM, 37.5 times higher than the 8 mM samples used here. We observed that agitation is required to dissolve 8 mM solutions of TIPS-Tn in toluene, and therefore propose that at a concentration of 300 mM TIPS-Tn may only be partially soluble, and consequently that aggregation may begin to occur at that concentration.Excimer formation may be facilitated by these aggregates, and is therefore absent at more dilute concentrations. Aggregate formation would explain why the decay of the S 1 state at 8 mM is overestimated by the Dover model. If SF or excimer formation were due to aggregates rather than, or in addition to, collisions between molecules, then the pseudo-first-order SF rate constants at 300 mM would not scale linearly with concentration, and the bimolecular rate constant would no longer be applicable. Using the rate constants fit to a', 'even at 20 mM, where the contribution to triplet formation is 3.5%. Dvořák et al. quantified the rate of SF in solution for TIPS-Pn concentrations ranging from 5-60 mM, but did not account for ISC. It is possible that for the lowest concentrations used, a portion the SF observed was actually due ISC, and the SF rates may be overestimated.ISC is potentially much faster for TIPS-Tn than TIPS-Pn, which can partly be explained by the smaller difference in energies between S 1 and T 1 . ISC may make a significant contribution to T 1 formation at higher concentrations, or faster rates of SF, than for TIPS-Pn. There are few studied in the literature about ISC in TIPS-Tn. For the very high concentrations of TIPS-Tn solutions studied previously (300 mM), the rate of SF (or excimer formation) would be sufficiently fast to far outcompete ISC. also reported the TA of a 0.51 mM solution of TIPS-Tn in chloroform. They set an upper limit of 6% triplet formation over 3 µs, which they attributed entirely to ISC. Using the rate constants found here, we predict a triplet yield of 12-13% over the singlet lifetime, of which ∼20% is in fact due to SF. More significantly, the higher rate constant of ISC can lead to the overestimation of SF rate constants or yields. In the case of the 8 mM solution studied here, including ISC shifted the SF rate constant from (2.6 ± 0.6) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 to (2.0±0.6)×10 9 M -1 s -1 , and the SF triplet yield from 18-28% to 13-23%. ISC could continue to contribute significantly to T 1 formation up to 35 mM, where ∼5% of triplet formation is predicted to be due to ISC. ) and (5).

1011,"ConclusionThe combination of trajectory surface hopping on potentials parametrized in the linear vibronic coupling model is an efficient approach to perform photodynamics simulations. For transition metal complexes, despite their typically large number of vibrational degrees of freedom and many close-lying electronic states, it becomes affordable to screen the nonadiabatic dynamics of many individual ones in order to test and establish design principles to improve their photophysical and photochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate this by screening the photophysics of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes derived from VCl 3 (ddpd). This complex, after excitation from the triplet ground state and following intersystem crossing to the singlet manifold, shows singlet-to-triplet phosphorescence in the nearinfrared region. Based on an analysis of the relaxation mechanism of VCl 3 (ddpd), we developed the hypothesis that by increasing the ligand-field strength in the complex could shift the electronic states to modify the mechanism in such a way as to lead to a higher phosphorescence yield. This was to be achieved by channeling more population from the triplet to the singlet states as well as reducing the amount of singlet-to-triplet reverse intersystem crossing that reduces the population available for phosphorescence.We then tested our hypothesis in two steps. First, we designed 18 complexes based on design principles established for other 3dmetal complexes with large ligand-field splitting. Thereby we found that strategies of including ligands that are strong σ -donors or both σ and π donors are particularly successful.

The hypothesis could be rationalized in the following manner: increasing the ligand-field splitting raises the energy of the antibonding e g orbitals while the energy of non-bonding t 2g orbitals is unaffected. The shifting of the orbital energies will result in a destabilization of all electronic states that possess electrons in e g orbitals as indicated by the red arrows in Figure (b), which could influence the excited-state dynamics mechanism in two ways. First, by increasing the energy of of the 3 A 2 states of e 2 g character, the 3 T ′ 1 → 3 A 2 reaction could be partially quenched. As this is the competing pathway of the population of the singlet states via intersystem crossing, its quenching could increase the amount of population that is transferred to the singlet manifold. Second, by increasing the energy of the 3 T 2 states, the Sing→ 3 T 2 depopulation of the singlet manifold could be quenched, which would leave more population in the singlet manifold to increase the photoluminescence yield. Both parts of the hypothesis will be referred to as hypothesis I and hypothesis II in the discussion lateron.', 'Among the 18 candidates complexes, we identified four complexes with ligandfield splitting larger than VCl 3 (ddpd). In the second step, we then performed long-time nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. For the four complexes, we could observe similar or larger transfer of electronic population via intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet states when compared to VCl 3 (ddpd). For two of the complexes, [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and VCl 3 (im-im-im), reverse intersystem crossing subsequently depopulated the singlet states on a 20 ps time scale making them non-promising candidates for near-infra emission despite their large ligand-field splitting. For the other two complexes, however, we found long-lived singlet population that remains constant even after 100 ps simulation time. For VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), this population of ca. 7% is of the same size as that for the reference VCl 3 (ddpd) complex (9%). For [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, in turn, the long-lived singlet population is almost doubled to 16%, i.e., making it a promising candidate for efficient 3d-metal based near-infrared emitters.While following our hypothesis resulted in a success in the screening, the detailed analysis of the relaxation mechanisms of VCl 3 (ddpd) and the four designed complexes revealed a complex picture. Despite nominally featuring electronic states of similar character, each complex displayed a unique reaction network in its photodynamics. This suggested that the success in the screening did not originate by following the assumption of our hypothesis, but rather resulted from some other, more individual electronic-structure features. In conclusion, the excited-state decay pathways of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes are complicated due to the large number of participating electronic states. Consequently, the effect of changing the ligand on their mechanisms are both difficult to predict and not obvious just from static electronic calculations. Instead, insights from more vanadium(III)', 'due to their Earth-abundance are designed to become sustainable replacements for currently used near-infrared emitter based on expensive noble metals and rare earth elements. We have previously studied the photodynamics of the emissive VCl 3 (ddpd) complex using SH and LVC potentials. When excited from its triplet ground-state, the complex undergoes intersystem crossing to the singlet states which are long-lived and emit in the near-infrared region at 1111 and 1219 nm, see Figure . Our simulations revealed the mechanism behind the population of the singlet states as well as of the competing nonradiative relaxation pathways back to the triple ground state. The character of the electronic states suggested that the relaxation mechanism can be modified to increase the population in the singlet states and thus lead to larger phosphorescence quantum yields by designing ligands that induce even larger ligand-field splitting in the complex. To do this, we have modified the ligand-structure in VCl 3 (ddpd) following rules established for other 3d-complexes. We first screened their excited-state energies using different electronic structure methods, and then performed SH/LVC dynamics simulations to test our hypothesis for the four most promising complexes. Our simulations show two complexes with similar or larger singlet populations that suggest increased phosphorescence yields.', ""J o u r n a l Na me Computational Screening of Photodynamics of Transition-Metal Complexes † The design of photoactive compounds is challenging due to the complicated nature that the ensuing photodynamics can assume. The complexity of this problem increases with the size and flexibility of the system, and the challenge becomes especially difficult in the rational design of open-shell transition-metal complexes where many electronic states and nuclear degrees of freedom participate in the excited-state dynamics. The only alternative is then to screen larger numbers of compounds as is done in the present work using computer simulations for a class of near-infrared emitting vanadium(III) complexes. Starting from the mechanism of the known emitter VCl 3 (ddpd) (ddpd = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-dipyridine-2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine), we establish design principles including an increase in the ligand-field strength in the complex in order to achieve higher emission quantum yields.

The mixture was cultured in an incubator for a period of time until approximately 90% of the bacteria died. After centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant was carefully discarded, and the remained bacteria were mixed well by adding 1 mL PBS. The bacteria were collected again by centrifugation. Then 1 mL PBS buffer containing 4% glutaraldehyde was added, and the sample was fixed overnight at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the collection was washed with 1 mL PBS, followed by gradual dehydration with different concentrations of ethanol (30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95 and 100%).

A further time-killing kinetics study on K18S4 against Grampositive bacteria S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and V. anguillarum (a representative of the common pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture) revealed a quick killing of bacteria at 2×MIC concentration of K18S4, such as the complete killing of V. anguillarum within 30 minutes (Fig ). The bacteria-killing of K18S4 was much faster than that of conventional antibiotic thiamphenicol, indicating advantages of K18S4 in treating aquacultureencountered bacterial infections.To examine if bacteria can develop resistance to the peptide polymers, we treated Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli with K18S4 at 0.5×MBC concentration continuously, and found that none of the bacteria developed resistance against K18S4 even after continuous treatment for 888 and 1152 generations of S. aureus and Even if an antibacterial agent, such as K18S4, shows low tendency to induce antimicrobial resistance, full degradability is still highly desired for antibiotic substitutes in aquaculture. The massive use and subsequent discharge of the antimicrobial agents to the environment may cause antimicrobial selective pressure and disruption of balance of the complicated microbial system in the environment, which is a big concern in massive use of antibiotics in aquaculture. Therefore, an ideal substitution of antibiotics in aquaculture should be fully degradable to individual residues and thus lose antibacterial activity completely after degradation. K18S4 was completely degraded within 6 hours in the presence of protease type XXIII from Aspergillus oryzae, as confirmed by NMR analysis on the disappearance of the characteristic peaks for α-CH group on the peptide backbone at In addition to enzymes produced by microorganisms, K18S4 can also be degraded by trypsin and chymotrypsin that are widely distributed in the digestive tract.

K18S4 displayed potent activities against all these pathogens with MIC in the range of 3.13-25 μg/mL; K18S4 was also bactericidal with minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) identical to its MIC for most bacteria. The overall antibacterial activity of K18S4 was superior to thiamphenicol and sulfadimethoxine, especially for MBC. We also examined the activity of K18S4 against fungi, though fungi are not major pathogens in aquaculture. K18S4 displayed potent activity against C. neoformans (MIC=1.56-3.13 μg/mL for all three strains) comparable to amphotericin B, but no obvious activity against C. albicans at a concentration up to 200 μg/mL (Table ). In the acute toxicity test on adult zebrafish, the LC50 (the median lethal concentration) value of K18S4 was 98.14 μg/mL (Fig 3b, Table ), which was much higher than the MIC and MBC values of K18S4 and indicated selective antibacterial properties of K18S4. Compared with α-Poly-L-lysine (LC50 of K21: 19.61 μg/mL), the acute toxicity of K18S4 to adult zebrafish was also significantly reduced (Table ). A further time-killing kinetics study on K18S4 against Grampositive', 'ResultsPeptide polymers (KxSy) were synthesized from the ring-opening polymerization on a mixture of Nε-tert- Antibacterial studies showed that three peptide polymers (K21 (α-Poly-L-lysine), K19S2, K18S4) had potent activities against multiple food animal-associated pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) as representative common pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio alginolyticus (V. alginolyticus), Vibrio anguillarum (V. anguillarum) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) as common pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture, Salmonella pullorum (S. pullorum), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) and Salmonella anatum (S. anatum) as common pathogenic bacteria in poultry, Mannheimia haemolytica (M. haemolytica), Streptococcus suis (S. suis) and Salmonella choleraesuis (S. choleraesuis) as common pathogenic bacteria in livestock (Fig ). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of three most active peptide polymers (K21, K19S2, K18S4) were in the range of 0.78-50 μg/mL.In addition, all these peptide polymers showed negligible (less than 0.2%) hemolysis on human red blood cells at a peptide polymer concentration up to 2000 μg/mL (Fig ). Peptide polymers K18S4, K16S6 and K13S8 all displayed low cytotoxicity against mammalian cells even at a peptide polymer concentration of 200 μg/mL, using COS-7 as a model (Fig ).

NMR characterization was conducted on deprotected peptide', 'by trypsin and chymotrypsin that are widely distributed in the digestive tract. Depending on the enzyme for the treatment the degradation products were dipeptides or tripeptides, all of which have no antibacterial activity (Fig ). ε-Poly-L-lysine as a FDA approved antibacterial food additive showed slightly better antibacterial activity than K18S4, but slower bacteria-killing (Fig ). Although ε-Poly-L-lysine was degradable by specific enzymes produced by few specific types of microorganisms , it was highly stable in the presence of many common enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, and maintained the original antibacterial activity after treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin (Fig ). Therefore, ε-Poly-L-lysine is not a suitable antibiotic substitute in aquaculture. After S. aureus was incubated with Dye-K18S4 and propidium iodide (PI, red fluorescence) for around 450s, a small amount of Dye-K18S4 began to accumulate in the cytoplasm without enrichment on the cell membrane beforehand (Fig ). At about 1260s, a burst of Dye-K18S4 and PI into the cytoplasm indicated critical damages on the cell membrane of S. aureus (Fig 4a ). The observed membrane damage was at the late stage of the bacteria-polymer interaction when S. aureus was killed by the peptide polymer. Since the Dye-K18S4 was not enriched on the cell membrane, the membrane damage may not be caused by Dye-K18S4 directly from the outside of the bacteria. Fluorescence intensity analysis across S. aureus cells, at 120s and 1500s after incubation, echoed above observation that Dye-K18S4 did not enrich either on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm at an early stage, but enriched inside the cell at a late stage (Figure <ref', ""binding assays: E. coli and V. anguillarum cultured to the stationary phase were diluted with MH medium to 2×10 5 CFU/mL.

T 1 and T m are very similar between frozen solution and single crystal measurements,showing that the spin dynamics of 1 are independent of the phase of the sample; this is also remarkable because the THF (C 4 H 8 O) solvent is rich with 1 H nuclear spins. Furthermore, T 1 and T m are also largely independent of molecular orientation or which nuclear spin m I transition is monitored (see different observer positions in Fig. ).

We achieve this by engineering the electronic configuration of the metal centre, an approach that could be combined with the beautiful engineering of the ligand shell demonstrated by other groups (7-11). In compounds 1 -4 the metal centre in the anion is three-coordinate with a pseudo-C 3 axis passing through the metal, perpendicular to the plane defined by the Cp' centroids in 1 -3 and the N atoms in 4 (Figure ). In all cases the continuous-wave EPR (CW-EPR) and echo-detected field swept (EDFS) spectroscopy of a fluid solution of these compounds shows a multiplet due to hyperfine coupling (A) of the single unpaired electron to the metal nucleus (Table ) (Fig. ). On freezing the solutions, a small axial g-anisotropy is observed in all cases; where z is coincident with the pseudo-C 3 axis), with a near isotropic hyperfine coupling (Figs. 2a; Table ).

Simulations using EasySpin (19).Pulsed EPR studies of 2 -4 confirm this is a general phenomenon; as there was not an easily available diamagnetic host for these complexes we have had to restrict our measurements to the melting point of the THF solvent (90 K). In this temperature range the behaviour for T 1 for 1 -4 is very similar. T m for 1 -3 are almost identical in this range; compound 4 shows a fall in T m at the highest temperature measured compared with the other compounds.Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (20) on the crystal structure of the anion in 1 (see Supplementary Information) give excellent agreement with experiment, and are independent of the functional and basis set chosen (Tables and). In order to understand the minimal g-anisotropy of 1, we have conducted complete active space selfconsistent field (CASSCF) calculations ( ) using the RAS-probing technique (23) (see Supplementary Information) on the crystal structure of the anion in 1. After including spin-orbit coupling, the g-values of the ground S = ½ state are predicted to be g x,y = 1.989(1) and g z = 2.002, in excellent agreement with the experimental data and DFT results (Table ). The ground state SOMO has a substantial contribution from the 4d z 2 functions on the Y atom (Fig. and), in good agreement with the spin density determined from DFT (Fig. <ref type=""figure""', 'μs -1 K -n , n = 3.16(5A z Y = -93.86, A x,y Y = -88.7(4) |A iso C1-5 | = 1.1(8) |A iso H2-5 | = 2(1) CASSCF - g z = 2.002, g x,y = 1.989(1) a For the parallel and perpendicular C hyperfines, the labels refer to the local principal axes, with the unique axis defined by the Cp¢ π-system, i.e. orthogonal to the molecular z axis.Given the long T m times, we are able to perform coherent spin manipulations as demonstrated by observation of Rabi oscillations (20) even at room temperature for 1@5 in transient nutation experiments (Fig. ; see Supplementary Information). These periodic oscillations in echo intensity as a function of the duration of a preceding nutation pulse correspond to cyclical generation of ç±m S ñ superposition states. All oscillations show the characteristic linear dependence of Rabi frequency (W R ) on nutation pulse attenuation (Figs. 2b, 2c and S10 -S22). W R is independent of temperature and the m I transition being monitored (Figs. S15 and S22), and is very similar between 1@5 and a frozen THF solution of 1(Figs. S10 -S22).The robustness of spin coherence in 1 prompted us to investigate the spin distribution by CW and pulsed EPR methods. We have quantified the electron spin density on the ligands with hyperfine sub-level correlation and electron nuclear double resonance (HYSCORE and ENDOR respectively (19); see Supplementary Information) measurements on 1 in THF solution. Weak hyperfine couplings to 1 H and C nuclei are observed (Fig. , S25 -S28; Table ), and are on the order of 1 -2 MHz for the Cp¢ ligands. We can be confident that we are not missing any large ligand hyperfine interactions (i.e. > 4MHz) because there is no resolution of 1 H hyperfine in the CW EPR (which has narrow', ')), and only a very weak temperature dependence below 20 K. T m has a much weaker temperature dependence than T 1 , and, due to the coincidence of the data for frozen solution and single crystal phase, we suspect that T m is limited by nuclear spin diffusion given the 1 Hrich environment of the molecule. At room temperature T m is smaller than T 1 by a factor of 4 -5 and hence T 1 has not limited T m and spin echoes are still observable. Fig. 4 .4Fig. 4.

At 1.094 Å, the O=C bond is unphysically short, and the O-C-S angle is over 180 • , meaning the OCS molecule deflects away from the Ne atom. Unfortunately, fixing individual OCS parameters leads to a much poorer fit.When the O=C distance is fixed to the equilibrium value, the structure fit doesn't converge, unless both C=S length and O-C-S angle are also fixed. The best option seems to be to fix the O-C-S angle to 180 • . This forces the O=C bond to shrink even further, but brings the C••Ne bond length within 14 mÅ of the MP2+δ(T) value.

It could be argued, that all experimentally available information should be used in the fit, and that any associated decrease in the quality of the fit reflects the errors in either the ∆B DFT e or the fit itself. We have considered this issue, and prefer to remain consistent with previous work. As mentioned above, the equilibrium structure of the OCS monomer is kept rigid and linear. The bond lengths of Morino and Matsumura 1are used for all r 0 and r SE e structures.Unlike in the previous work, the initial fit reported here takes into account all available isotopologue data. This structure is used as the r SE e in the following text. The BLYP functional predicts a 43 mÅ longer separation.In the lightest two complexes, some of the DFAs yield negative frequencies when anharmonic corrections are applied to the (positive) harmonic frequencies. Two negative frequencies can be observed in the BLYP results for Ne• • •OCS, one can be observed in both B2PLYP and B3LYP results for the He• • •OCS complex. The weakly bound intermonomer mode is always one of those problematic degrees of freedom. For the Ne• • •OCS complex the B2PLYP and B3LYP corrections are comparable and the r SE e structures differ by less than 3 mÅ. However, the CCSD(T) results for the parent isotopologue are inconsistent with the DFT calculations.The story is similar in the He• • •OCS complex. The B2PLYP-based r SE e follows the trend in bond lengths of the rare gas group, but the obtained angle is significantly different. On the other hand, the anharmonic frequencies obtained with BLYP do not have negative artefacts, and the angle in the BLYP structure of the He complex is more consistent with the rest of the dataset. However, the intermonomer separation obtained with BLYP is 3.7514(3) Å, which is longer than Kr• • •OCS and therefore unrealistic.The CCSD(T) structure has an angle similar to the BLYP', 'in OCS, the remaining structural parameters (O=C=S angle, C=S bond length and the Xe-dependent parameters) remain within the uncertainty of the fits and the degree of fit decreases slightly. Both r m structures also show a bend in the OCS monomer of ∼1 • . From this data alone it is impossible to judge whether the distortion of the OCS monomer is an artefact of the fit.The most striking difference between the r m ), and theoretical (rMP2+δ(T) e) structure of Xe• • •OCS. m structures is shifted slightly towards the S atom.A comparison with the equilibrium structure obtained using MP2+δ(T) reveals that the chosen level of wavefunction theory predicts a significantly shorter monomer separation compared to the mass dependent as well as the semi-experimental structures (by 43 mÅ and 73 mÅ, respectively). The O=C••Xe angle from MP2+δ(T) is almost identical with the r SE e structure. The OCS monomer in the r SE e structure is only slightly distorted from the equilibrium values, with a 0.2 • inward bend. This leads us to two conclusions: i) the OCS monomer remains at near-equilibrium values, and the significant deviations of the OCS moiety from its equilibrium shape in both r m structures can be attributed to the fitting process, and ii) an effect unaccounted for in the MP2+δ(T) method leads to a larger monomer separation in the experimental results.As 7 isotopologues of the Ne• • •OCS complex have been measured by Xu and Gerry, 6 it is possible to apply the above fitting process to that set of rotational constants. The resulting rm structure is compared to the r SE e structure with B2PLYP-based corrections and the r MP2+δ(T) e structure in Fig. .The issues with the r SE e structure are obvious at the first glance: the C••Ne distance is longer by ∼140 mÅ compared to the other two structures, and the angle is also significantly different.', 'and the main difference is in the O=C••Xe angle. This further confirms that the structure is likely near convergence with respect to basis set size.We have investigated two additional basis set effects: counterpoise correction for the basis set superposition error, and the effect of diffuse functions. The former has no significant effect on the structure, as the difference in the monomer separation obtained from MP2+δ(T) and CP-MP2+δ(T) is only 0.001 Å. On the other hand, the aug-MP2+δ(T) structure obtained with cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z basis sets augmented by diffuse functions (see in Fig. ) is remarkably close to the experimental r(2) m structure, with a disagreement in the monomer separation of only 15 mÅ. While this is most certainly a step in the direction, the increased computational cost compared to cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z calculations is immense: the augmentation of the basis set increases the number of basis functions by 20%, and the amount of memory required for the computation of the connected triples (ie. the (T) component) more than doubles. Notably, additive terms obtained from the differences of augmented and unaugmented 3-ζ calculations that are used in various extrapolation recipes do not perform well for non-covalent complexes. Therefore CCSD(T) computations with augmented 4-ζ basis sets might be unavoidable.Unfortunately, the currently available set of ""aug-cc-pwCVnZ""-quality basis sets is limited to the first two periods in the main group and first row transition metals, and appropriate density fitting basis sets are also unavailable.When the effect of correlating all core electrons is added to the MP2+δ(T) potential surface ( ), the minimum in the potential moves even further away from the r m structure is a case of obtaining a correct answer for the wrong reasons.', '. The calculated MP2+δ(T) binding energies D E are in a good agreement with the experimental values using the Lennard-Jones model for complexes up to Kr. This agreement breaks down with in heavier complexes likely due to relativistic effects. The minor disagreement in the interaction energies compared to previous CCSD(T) literature data can be explained by basis set incompleteness in the literature results. The deformation of the OCS monomer from its equilibrium structure upon complexation is predicted to be minimal, with the largest bend of 0.3 • predicted for Hg• • •OCS. The mass-dependent r (2) m structures of the Xe and Ne complexes differ significantly from the r SE e structures. The bond lengths and angles in the OCS monomer are distorted in the r ([1,2]) m fits, especially the position of the O-atom. However, with the OCS monomer constrained to its equilibrium geometry, the mass-dependent structures are likely the most accurate structures ever obtained for the two complexes. The 43 mÅ difference in the monomer separation in the MP2+δ(T) and r (2) m structures can be partially explained by the lack of diffuse functions in the cc-pwcVnZ basis sets: upon augmentation the difference drops to 15 mÅ. The closest agreement with the r (2) m structure could be obtained by adding the 4-th order relativistic correction (+δ 4 rel ) to the MP2+δ(T) results, highlighting the importance of relativistic effects. However, this procedure cannot be generally recommended, as the scalar relativistic effects are double-counted. The inclusion of diffuse functions into at least 4-ζ basis sets is a more systematic way of converging towards experimental structures.', 'Kr• • •OCS and therefore unrealistic.The CCSD(T) structure has an angle similar to the BLYP structure, but the intermonomer separation of 3.233 Å is too short, even shorter than the B2PLYP result. Furthermore, the vibration-rotation interaction constants for the parent isotopologue are completely different between the CCSD(T) and the three DFAs.

In particular, we highlight that some TM atoms have reduced unpaired electron density depending on their position. For example, for Cr intercalation, the αβ (unpaired) electron population is larger for Cr atoms intercalated at the centroid of boroxine or triazine rings, compared to those intercalated at the centroid of benzene rings, with the exception of Cr-02 where magnetic moments are reduced in triazine rings. In the Ni-04 and Ni-05 configurations, MPA indicates reduced spin density for Ni atoms intercalated in boroxine and triazine rings, compared to benzene rings. Sc-02 and Sc-04 have a reduced number of unpaired electrons for atoms intercalated at the centroid of triazine rings, and Sc-03 has a very small amount of unpaired electron density for all Sc atoms. Finally, for Ti intercalation, the only atoms that show open-shell configurations are those intercalated at the centroid of boroxine rings. It is important to note that, even though MPA gives a good indication of the type of magnetic configuration (FM, FiM, AFM, NM) for the intercalated TM atoms, it is known to yield inaccurate results for the number of unpaired electrons due to an overestimation of bonds' covalent",Comparative,How do the magnetic states of Co and V intercalations compare across different concentrations?,"Co and V intercalations are ferromagnetic (FM) for configurations TM-01 through TM-04, but ferrimagnetic (FiM) for the TM-05 configuration.",Medium,"['Co and V intercalations are FM for configurations TM-01 through TM-04, but FiM for the TM-05 configuration.']","[[209, 418]]","['(instead of boroxine or triazine rings) reduces their ILD. This reduced distance indicates highly favorable binding between the TMs (Cr, Ti, and V) and benzene rings. On the other hand, structures intercalated with Cu atoms follow the expected proportional increase with the number of intercalated atoms, except for Cu-02 and Cu-03, which have the same ILD of 3.44 Å. A similar phenomenon occurs in Mn-intercalated structures, where Mn-03 (3.45 Å) presents very similar ILD as Mn-02 (3.44 Å). Furthermore, Fe-intercalated structures present an increasing ILD for Fe-01, Fe-02, and Fe-03 configurations; however, there is a decrease from Fe-03(3.46 Å) to Fe-04a (3.39 Å). The only difference between Fe-03 and Fe-04a configurations is an additional Fe atom intercalated at the centroid of boroxine rings; therefore, the decrease in ILD leads us to propose that Fe has a similar affinity to benzene, boroxine, and triazine rings. This is reflected in the binding energies, which are very similar for configurations Fe-03, Fe-04, and Fe-05. This behavior also occurs in Sc-03 and Sc-04a, where the ILD decreases by adding a TM at the centroid of boroxine rings. Interestingly, the Fe and Sc intercalation also have similar binding energy trends for the different concentrations intercalation patterns. On the other hand, Mn-and Ni-intercalations are the only groups that follow the initally-expected trend, where the ILD is proportional to an increasing number of intercalated atoms. Another interesting result is that the ILDs of configurations Co-01b (3.33 Å), Co-04a (3.33 Å), Cr-01b (3.28 Å), Cr-03 (3.11 Å), Cr-04b (3.17 Å), Fe-01a/b (3.28/3.27 Å), Ti-01b (3.29 Å), Ti-03 (3.26 Å), Ti-04b (3.32 Å), V-01a/b (3.31/3.28 Å), V-03 (3.21 Å), and V-04b (3.29 Å) are smaller than the ILD of the pristine structure, suggesting weaker steric repulsions and potentially indicating high affinity between TMs and COF layers for these configurations. Finally-in terms of intercalants moving in the xy plane-we', ""MagnetismAfter generating the sixty-three intercalated structures, we performed a preliminary structural optimization. This procedure determined if our compounds possess spin-polarized states, and gave us a starting geometry to work with. During these early optimizations, the TM atoms' electronic states were populated in a ferromagnetic alignment, and their spin was locked for the first 3-5 iterations of the first self-consistent field (SCF) cycle. After this initial spin locking, the system was left unconstrained and allowed to drift toward the magnetic state that minimized its energy.We further investigated the structures' magnetic behavior starting from their pre-optimized geometries (obtained from the discussion above). In order to find the most stable magnetic structure at each transition metal concentration, we tested all magnetic states that were compatible with the P6m2 symmetry of the system. These magnetic states include NM, FM, and AFM/FiM configurations for some structures. Table in the supplementary information shows the different magnetic configurations tested at each TM concentration. For every magnetic configuration, we ran one single-point energy (self consistent field) calculation on the pre-optimized geometries, where the TM magnetic states were spin-locked for the first 10 iterations of the cycle. After the single-point calculations, if an AFM, FiM, or NM structure was more energetically favorable than its initial FM configuration, we computed another geometry optimization for that particular magnetic structure. Even though the atomic structure remains the same, changing a structure's magnetic configuration can result in vastly different electronic properties. Therefore, it was crucial to find the most stable magnetic state in our materials.Table shows the preferred magnetic"", ""ConclusionsIn this work, we performed a comprehensive hybrid-level computational study of transition metal intercalation in triazinebenzene-boroxine 2D COFs for catalytic, magnetic, and electronic/spintronic property enhancement. We describe the structural and electronic properties of the pristine bilayer 2D COF. This structure presents insulating electronic character (bandgap of 3.40 eV). In this material, carbon atoms are the main contributors to the electronic states surrounding the Fermi level. Next, we generated sixty-three intercalated bilayer structures with nine first-row transition metals. Our analyses reveal that the type, concentration, and position of intercalants changes their structural, magnetic, and electronic features. Structurally, intercalation results in changes in the interlayer distance, which can be directly related to interaction strength between the transition metals and the bilayer. The structural analysis was complemented with a binding energy analysis, where we observe that transition metal intercalation is energetically preferred at the centroid of benzene rings, followed by triazine and boroxine. This indicates that-generally-during intercalation, the centroid of benzene rings will be populated first, followed by triazine, and finally boroxine. Magnetically, we observe a wide range of stable spin configurations (FM, FiM, AFM, NM), which depend on the type, position, and concentration of intercalants. This wide range of magnetic features allows to fine-tune and enhance 2D COFs' features for photocatalytic, electronic, and spintronic applications. In general, we find that transition metal d-orbitals have important contributions to the density of states around the Fermi level and can even promote the contribution of C, N, B, and O atoms around the Fermi level. Within our sixty-three intercalated bilayer 2D COFs, we find that twenty-four of our materials are conductors in at"", 'rings only) in general have larger BE than other configurations, with the only exception being Fe, which has equal BE for TM-03 and TM-04b. Furthermore, from Table , we observe that-for most configurations-TM-03 has a very small change in ILD with respect to TM-02, and in some cases is even smaller than TM-02, even though it has more intercalated atoms in its structure. This indicates high stability and stronger interactions for intercalants at the centroid of benzene rings. Another important trend observed throughout all configurations is that TM-01a and TM-04a are less energetically favorable than their TM-01b and TM-04b counterparts, which can be observed from their binding energies. This trend is also evident in the ILD (see Table ), which is smaller when intercalating atoms at the centroid of triazine rings (""b"" configurations) compared to boroxine rings (""a"" configurations), indicating stronger interactions for TM-01b and TM-04b. From these results, we predict that-in general-during intercalation the centroid of benzene rings will be populated first, followed by triazine rings, and boroxine rings will be populated last.From Table column 3, it can be observed that the ILD, in general, was modified for all TM-intercalated 2D COF materials with respect to the pure 2D COF (3.34 Å), due to the interaction between 2D COF layers and the TM atoms. Initially, we expected the ILD to increase proportional to the number of intercalated atoms; however, this was not the case. For structures with Cr, Ti, and V intercalants, we observe a trend where the TM-03 configuration has an equal or smaller ILD than TM-01 and TM-02 configurations. Even though TM-03 COFs have more atoms intercalated in the bilayer, their position at the centroid of benzene rings (instead of boroxine or triazine rings) reduces their ILD. This reduced distance indicates highly', 'Furthermore, the DOS reveals that carbon atoms are the main contributors to the electronic states around the Fermi level, i.e., near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM). The dynamical stability of the pristine bilayer 2D COF was confirmed through vibrational calculations at the Γ, M, and K reciprocal lattice points, which revealed no imaginary frequency modes, indicating a stable structure. The pristine optimized structure was taken as a starting point to generate the intercalated 2D COFs. Transition metals were positioned at the centroid of the bilayer COF rings in different concentrations. Intercalants and concentrations will be referred to as TM-01 through TM-05, where TM = [Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Sc, Ti, and V]. There are two variations of TM-01 and TM-04, which we distinguish by adding ""a"" or ""b"" to the name. Therefore, we generated seven different atomic configurations each with nine TM intercalants, resulting in a total of 63 intercalated bilayer 2D COFs. Configuration TM-01a has one transition metal per unit cell, positioned at the centroid of boroxine rings. TM-01b also has one transition metal per unit cell, positioned at the centroid of triazine rings. TM-02 has two transition metals per unit cell, placed at the centroid of boroxine and triazine rings. TM-03 has three transition metals per unit cell, located at the centroid of all benzene rings. TM-04a has four transition metals per unit cell, intercalated at the centroid of all benzene and boroxine rings. TM-04b also has four transition metals per unit cell, intercalated at the centroid of all benzene and triazine rings. Finally, TM-05 has transition metals located at the centroid of all rings in the structure (triazine, benzene, and boroxine).']","['Unclassified', 'Unclassified']",3775,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9487383741984458,2.220446049250313e-16,"['how', 'compare']"

An otherwise similar scenario was observed when conducting the Kumada-Corriu reaction of 3 and 5 (Scheme 7).

The arene fragment interacts with the Ni-Ni core via both a s-bond and a h 2 -interaction, with a bridging pivalate between the two Ni centers. Given that NBO analysis of I showed a symmetrical distribution of charge at the Ni-Ni core, we wondered whether a dynamic motion between the Ni-Ni core might enable a formal translocation of the Ni center at a proximal C(sp 2 ) site by forming a new s-bond and a h 2 -interaction with the arene backbone. If successful, such a process might constitute a formal metal translocation over the arene backbone, thus setting the basis for establishing a new rationale for enabling Ni-catalyzed C(sp 2 )-H functionalization of C-O electrophiles via ""ring-walking"" in the absence of directing groups or metalation events. Prompted by our interest in Ni-catalyzed C-H functionalization, we report herein the successful realization of this goal. Experimental and DFT studies demonstrate the viability for enabling a ""ring-walking"" prior to C-C bond formation, with a mechanism likely arising from an abnormal 1,2-hydride shift.

The preparation of 3-7 is particularly noteworthy, representing the first examples of isolation of dinuclear oxidative addition species from non-p-extended aryl pivalates. While these complexes could unambiguously be characterized by NMR spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography of 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 univocally confirmed the interaction of the arene with the Ni-Ni core by both a s-bond and a h 2 -interaction. In line with these observations, 1-8 show a representative dp of 22.5-27.5 ppm with a Ni-Ni bond ranging from 2.3855(4)-2.433(3) Å. The dinuclear structure is completed by a bridging pivalate ligand having identical Ni-O bond distances. With a series of well-defined Ni-Ni complexes in hand, we turned our attention to study the viability for triggering a ""ring-walking"" throughout the arene backbone. We anticipated that the motion required for enabling a nickel translocation might be facilitated by a subtle temperature control or stereoelectronic effects. To this end, we monitored the stability of 1 at 50 ºC by 31 P{ 1 H}NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 4). A ratio of 1:2 (1:1.2 ratio) was observed after 6 h, thus confirming the viability for nickel translocation over a p-extended backbone.

Experimental and computational studies support a translocation occurring via a 1,2-hydride shift.

Unlike other metals in the d 10 series, the reactivity of nickel catalysts in C(sp 2 )-H functionalization remain predominantly confined to the utilization of proximal, yet strongly-coordinating, directing groups, with bond formation occurring at the ortho position (Scheme 1, top). 3 Despite the advances realized, particularly in Catellanitype reactions, 4 the means to enable distal C(sp 2 )-H functionalization aided by Ni species without recourse to directing groups, acidic C(sp 2 )-H bonds or aryl halides 5 still remains an unexplored cartography, particularly with phenol C-O derivatives as traceless entities (path b). 6 Scheme 1.

However, the energy difference between 1 and 2 was not significant enough to ensure exclusive formation of the latter, thus reinforcing the results illustrated in Scheme 4. DFT calculations revealed that ""ring-walking"" of 1 en route to 2 might occur via 1,2-hydride shift via an energetically-favorable transition state TS1 (26.9 kcal•mol -1 ) in which C-H bond-cleavage is enabled by formation of a Ni-H bond. Interestingly, the shifting hydrogen atom is shared by the two Ni centers at unsymmetrical distances of 1.5 and 1.9 Å and by the C2 carbon atom (1.6 Å). An otherwise similar TS2 was located by starting with 2 as precursor instead with an activation barrier of 22.9 kcal•mol -1 . Putting these results into perspective, the 1,2-hydride shift might not occur directly from carbon to carbon, but rather in a two-step process via the intermediacy of Int-1 possessing a µ-hydride bridge between the two Ni centers. Unfortunately, all our attempts at either isolating Int-1 or detect the formation of the highly shielded bridging µ-hydride by NMR spectroscopy were unsuccessful, suggesting that these species might not be particularly stable in solution. This notion gains credence by the kinetically instability found for Int-1, possessing a higher energy when compared to both 1 and 2 (>17.0 kcal•mol -1 ), thus precluding its isolation or detection by conventional analytical techniques.

Such experimental binding energies are generally valid under two assumptions: i) the center-of-mass axis of the monomers is approximately parallel with the a axis of inertia, and ii) the centrifugal distortion is mainly due to a single vibrational mode along the center-of-mass axis. While the latter is true for all of the studied complexes, the former approximation is only valid from Ar••OCS down the group.The agreement between the experimental estimates and the calculated D E data is remarkably good for the rare gas complexes (within ""chemical accuracy"" of 0.4 kJ/mol), given how naïve such a fit to a Lennard-Jones model is. The Hg• • •OCS complex is again an outlier: the experimental binding energy is significantly weaker than the calculated value. Relativistic effects are likely to play a significant role in both Hg and Xe complexes. Such effects are ""included"" implicitly in the experimental value, but in MP2+δ(T) they are treated only in the effective core potential of the basis set. See further remarks on relativistic effects below.The Lennard-Jones model can be in principle cross-checked for validity using calculated data. This is achieved by using the R cm \'s from the r B2PLYP e structures, along with the associated rotational constants, as well as the centrifugal distortion constant D B2PLYP J obtained using second-order vibrational perturbation calculations. The results are shown in Table in the Supporting information. The binding energies obtained using the supermolecular approach (ie. from E complex -E monomers ) should be identical to the Lennard-Jones model when B2PLYP-derived data is used in both. The large discrepancy between the r B2PLYP e results and all other results is due to the significant underprediction of the centrifugal', 'in OCS, the remaining structural parameters (O=C=S angle, C=S bond length and the Xe-dependent parameters) remain within the uncertainty of the fits and the degree of fit decreases slightly.

The O=C••Xe angle from MP2+δ(T) is almost identical with the r SE e structure. The OCS monomer in the r SE e structure is only slightly distorted from the equilibrium values, with a 0.2 • inward bend. This leads us to two conclusions: i) the OCS monomer remains at near-equilibrium values, and the significant deviations of the OCS moiety from its equilibrium shape in both r m structures can be attributed to the fitting process, and ii) an effect unaccounted for in the MP2+δ(T) method leads to a larger monomer separation in the experimental results.As 7 isotopologues of the Ne• • •OCS complex have been measured by Xu and Gerry, 6 it is possible to apply the above fitting process to that set of rotational constants. The resulting rm structure is compared to the r SE e structure with B2PLYP-based corrections and the r MP2+δ(T) e structure in Fig. .The issues with the r SE e structure are obvious at the first glance: the C••Ne distance is longer by ∼140 mÅ compared to the other two structures, and the angle is also significantly different.', '. The calculated MP2+δ(T) binding energies D E are in a good agreement with the experimental values using the Lennard-Jones model for complexes up to Kr. This agreement breaks down with in heavier complexes likely due to relativistic effects. The minor disagreement in the interaction energies compared to previous CCSD(T) literature data can be explained by basis set incompleteness in the literature results. The deformation of the OCS monomer from its equilibrium structure upon complexation is predicted to be minimal, with the largest bend of 0.3 • predicted for Hg• • •OCS. The mass-dependent r (2) m structures of the Xe and Ne complexes differ significantly from the r SE e structures. The bond lengths and angles in the OCS monomer are distorted in the r ([1,2]) m fits, especially the position of the O-atom. However, with the OCS monomer constrained to its equilibrium geometry, the mass-dependent structures are likely the most accurate structures ever obtained for the two complexes. The 43 mÅ difference in the monomer separation in the MP2+δ(T) and r (2) m structures can be partially explained by the lack of diffuse functions in the cc-pwcVnZ basis sets: upon augmentation the difference drops to 15 mÅ. The closest agreement with the r (2) m structure could be obtained by adding the 4-th order relativistic correction (+δ 4 rel ) to the MP2+δ(T) results, highlighting the importance of relativistic effects. However, this procedure cannot be generally recommended, as the scalar relativistic effects are double-counted.

The first * resonance of pyrene has two maxima, which are caused by the C1s→LUMO and C1s→LUMO+1 excitations, as was ascertained by MO-projected NEXAFS simulations (see Figure in the SI and Ref. ). For azupyrene, the individual excitations in the first peak are not resolved, because the corresponding LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals are too close in energy. For both molecules, the MO-projected NEXAFS simulations show that the leading edge of the adsorption peak is determined by the C1s→LUMO excitation.The X-ray absorption edge of azupyrene appears at a lower photon energy by 0.37 eV than that of pyrene, as can be seen in Figure . Since the core-level energies differ only marginally, it can therefore be concluded that the LUMO of azupyrene is lower in energy. Theory also predicts the LUMO of azupyrene to be lower in energy, here the magnitude is 0.60 eV.Combination of the experimental differences of electron addition and removal energies from UPS and NEXAFS data indicate that the electronic band gap is 0.72 eV (= 0.37 eV + 0.35 eV) smaller for azupyrene than for pyrene. For comparison, the calculations yield a value of 0.87 eV for the difference in electronic band gap, which is in good agreement with the experimental finding. In addition, the calculations can provide the absolute electronic band gaps, which are not accessible by the experimental techniques at our disposal. The calculated absolute electronic band gaps are 2.96 eV and 3.83 eV for azupyrene and pyrene, respectively. These values can be compared to the optical band gaps of 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, as determined by UV/Vis,",Comparative,"Which molecule, azupyrene or pyrene, has a larger electronic band gap?",Pyrene has a larger electronic band gap than azupyrene.,Easy,"['The calculated absolute electronic band gaps are 2.96 eV and 3.83 eV for azupyrene and pyrene, respectively.']","[[1566, 1674]]","['Analysis of the Valence Electronic StructureAzupyrene with its nonalternant \uf070-electron system has a much smaller optical gap than its alternant isomer pyrene. This is apparent in the intense yellow color displayed by solutions of azupyrene, whereas solutions of pyrene are colorless (See insets in Figure ). In agreement with the yellow color of azupyrene, the UV/Vis spectrum (Figure ) shows an absorption peak for azupyrene at a photon energy of 2.6 eV, in the blue part of the visible range. Pyrene has its lowest energy peak at a much higher photon energy of 3.7 eV, well outside the visible range. The resulting optical excitation energies, determined from the rising edge of the peak, are 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding a difference of 1.09 eV. Our ab initio calculations within the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) approach (see vertical lines in Figure ) overestimate the absolute excitation energies for both molecules. However, the calculations yield a difference in transition energies of 1.10 eV between azupyrene and pyrene, in excellent agreement with the experiment. It should be noted that while the lowest energy excitation corresponds to the transition from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO→LUMO) in pyrene, this transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and the peak in the visible range has to be attributed to the transition into a higher lying unoccupied orbital (HOMO→LUMO+1). The calculated data for the UPS and NEXAFS spectra was rigidly shifted to match the experimental energy scale. The calculated NEXAFS transitions have already been published in context of method development. The optical gap determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy must be distinguished from', 'X-ray Photoelectron SpectroscopyFigure shows X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectra of the azupyrene and pyrene films. The C1s signals are centered at 284.66 eV for azupyrene and 284.81 eV for pyrene with respect to the Fermi energy EF. The azupyrene peak shows a larger width (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 1.16 eV) and is slightly asymmetric with a shoulder at the high binding energy side. The pyrene peak is symmetric and has a smaller width (FWHM = 0.94 eV). The differences in peak shape and peak width can be explained with the help of DFT calculations, which provide the binding energies for the individual carbon atoms in the molecules. For this purpose, the core-electron binding energies were calculated with a localized core-hole in a \uf044SCF scheme and compared to the experimental data by way of a fitting procedure. In this procedure, the relative binding energies and relative intensities (given by the number of symmetry equivalent carbon atoms) were taken as fixed parameters forming the overall theoretical C 1s peak of the molecule as sum over the equivalent carbon sub peaks, each represented by a pseudo-Voigt peak. The single-peakwidth and the Gaussian-to-Lorentzian ratio were constricted to be equal for all sub peaks and were parameters of the fit procedure together with the overall intensity and a global energy shift. As can be seen in Figure ,b, the agreement between experiment and theory is remarkably good, allowing us to explain the peak shape based on the theoretical model. According to this analysis, the asymmetry of the azupyrene peak is caused by the more distinctly different chemical environments of its carbon atoms. Especially the signal related to the carbon atoms in the central bridge (blue in Figure ) is', 'to the optical band gaps of 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, as determined by UV/Vis, yielding a deviation between (experimental) optical and (calculated) electronic band gaps of 0.42 eV for azupyrene and 0.20 eV for pyrene.The deviation between the electronic and the optical gap for azupyrene is in fact even larger due to the symmetry selection rules at play. The HOMO→LUMO dipole transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and therefore the LUMO energy does not control the optical band gap. (It should be noted that the HOMO→LUMO transition might still be responsible for a very weak signal at about 1.8 eV as shown in Figure in the SI, which is neglected for the following calculations.) For pyrene, the HOMO→LUMO transition is allowed and determines the optical band gap. If the difference between the optical band gap and the electronic band gap is to be calculated in a meaningful manner using electronic ""frozen orbital"" transition energies, the LUMO has to be excluded for azupyrene. Accordingly, the DFT-calculated electronic band gap of azupyrene increases from 2.96 eV to 3.62 eV. With this value the difference between the DFT-based ""frozen orbital"" electronic band gap and the (experimental) optical band gap is 1.08 eV (= 3.62 eV -2.54 eV) for azupyrene, while the same difference is only 0.20 eV (= 3.83 eV -3.63 eV) for pyrene. The large deviation between the electronic and optical band gap for azupyrene is a direct consequence of its nonalternant \uf070-electron system. This topological property of azupyrene leads to a localization of the molecular orbitals. When an electron is excited into a higher lying orbital, then its initial and final orbitals can be located in different parts of the molecule, thus decreasing electron-electron repulsion in the excited state and lowering the transition energy. This explanation was already used to explain the color of the prototypical nonalternant molecule azulene.', 'Figure 2 .2Figure 2.

The spatial separation of the excited electron from its orbital of origin (the hole left behind upon excitation) suggests a small electron-hole binding energy in azupyrene. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that electron and hole, i.e., positive and negative charge carriers, can more easily be separated in azupyrene-based than in pyrene-based organic electronics devices.For illustration, the frontier orbitals of azupyrene are shown in Figure : the HOMO is partly localized at the tip-atoms of the 7-membered rings and has vanishing coefficients at the neighboring atoms and the central C2-unit, whereas the LUMO+1 shows a reversed localization with a nodal plane running through the tip atoms of the 7-membered ring (see Figure , left). In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO of pyrene are linked by the Coulson-Rushbrooke pairing theorem and thus are localized on the same carbon atoms (see Figure , right). Thus, the lower band gap of azupyrene is caused by its nonalternant nature in two ways: (i) the ""frozen orbital"" electronic band gap is smaller, because the HOMO is higher in energy and the LUMO is lower in energy and (ii) the reduced electron-electron repulsion in the excited state leads to an even smaller optical band gap.The fact that the HOMO→LUMO transition is forbidden for azupyrene has further consequences for its fluorescence spectrum. Indeed, no substantial fluorescence could be detected for azupyrene (see Figure of the SI). Adhering to Kasha\'s rule, the azupyrene molecule would relax non-radiatively to the lowest excited singlet state S1, where one electron resides in the former LUMO.

653,"IntroductionThe polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene serves as an important building block for semiconductors used in organic electronic devices. Pyrene-based materials have found application in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs). One of the most important driving forces enabling the use of pyrene over a wide range of applications is the possible functionalization of its molecular backbone. Accordingly, previous research in the field has focused on modifying the properties of pyrene by introducing substituents at the periphery of the molecule or by incorporating pyrene units into semiconducting polymers. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the -electron system on the properties of pyrene has not yet been addressed.During the past years, the importance of topology for the molecular properties of organic semiconductors has been increasingly recognized. The inherent promise for performance improvements resulted in a revived interest in nonalternant -electron systems and first efforts to use the related molecules in (opto)electronic devices have been made. However, most of the related studies focus on azulene and its derivatives. In this study, we explore the influence of the -topology on the properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by comparing pyrene (Figure , left) with its isomer azupyrene (Figure ,",Explanatory,In what have pyrene-based materials found application?,"Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs)",Easy,"['Pyrene-based materials have found application in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs).']","[[148, 309]]","['Topology Effects in Molecular Organic Electronic Materials: Pyrene and Azupyrene Pyrene derivatives play a prominent role in organic electronic devices, including field effect transistors, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. The flexibility in the desired properties has previously been achieved by variation of substituents at the periphery of the pyrene backbone. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the central \uf070-electron system on the relevant properties such as the band gap or the fluorescence behavior has not yet been addressed. In this work, pyrene is compared with its structural isomer azupyrene, which has a \uf070-electron system with nonalternant topology. Using photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and other methods, it is shown that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of pyrene. The difference of the optical band gaps is even larger with 1.09 eV, as determined by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. The nonalternant nature of azupyrene is also associated with a more localized charge distribution, as can be seen in 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance shifts, as well as the C1s core-level shifts. Further insight is provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the molecular properties and ab initio coupled cluster calculations of the optical transitions. The concept of aromaticity is used to interpret DFT-based structures and for the theoretical assignment of the vibrational modes of the infrared spectra, where major topology-related differences are apparent.', ""ConclusionOur systematic multi-technique comparison of the organic semiconductor pyrene and its nonalternant isomer azupyrene revealed major topology-related differences of their electronic properties. UPS and NEXAFS show that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of the alternant molecule pyrene, and theory predicts a very similar difference of 0.87 eV. The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding an even larger difference of 1.09 eV. One reason why this difference is larger for azupyrene is due to symmetry selection rules, which result in a forbidden HOMO→LUMO transition and the lack of fluorescence for azupyrene. These special properties of azupyrene's electronic structure are related to the nonalternant topology of its \uf070-electron system. The topology of azupyrene also leads to a more localized charge distribution, visible in the experimental XPS and NMR shifts as well as in the DFT-calculated partial charges, all showing a negative charge surplus at the apices of the 7-membered rings and positive charge at the central C2-unit. The conjugated system of pyrene is best described as a biphenyl with two ethenediyl bridges, whereas azupyrene is a [14]annulene with a central double-bonded C2 unit. This interpretation follows from HOMA considerations, bond length changes, and the vibrational modes seen in experimental and calculated IR spectra. Overall, we found that the topology of the \uf070electron system drastically influences the electronic structure of the two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Those differences in electronic structure are reflected in the absorption and fluorescence behavior, a lower electron-hole binding energy, and a lower barrier to electron-hole separation for azupyrene. The possible application of nonalternant molecules in organic electronic devices is favored by those differences. We propose"", ""the valence electronic structure in applicationrelated polycrystalline thin films of pyrene and azupyrene. The thereby obtained electronic band gaps are compared with the optical band gaps, as determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy. We use complementary quantum theoretical calculations on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) and the coupled cluster (CC) approximation to gain a deeper understanding of the electronic structure and observed optical and electronic transitions in UV/Vis as well as in fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, we discuss the results of NMR and IR spectroscopy together with an analysis according to the HOMA approach.The theoretical methods were always employed on the gas-phase molecules to have the same reference for experiments performed on thin films and on solutions of the molecules. The gas phase calculations additionally offer a more accessible interpretation using the molecular electronic states. However, we performed additional calculations for the molecular crystals with periodic boundary conditions to gauge the influence of intermolecular interactions, which are present in the experiments involving thin films, on the electronic properties.Our study reveals and illustrates the striking influence of the \uf070-electron system's topology on the electronic properties. The nonalternant molecule shows significantly lower electronic and optical band gaps and we found strong indications for lower electron-hole binding energies, which can facilitate electron-hole separation. Applying these results in the form of topological design to the development of new materials for organic electronic devices can open up a new pathway for tuning their properties in a systematic manner. Only in the case of pyrene can the atoms be alternatingly labelled (red/green), while this is not possible for azupyrene."", 'left) with its isomer azupyrene (Figure , right). Pyrene has an alternant \uf070-electron system, which means that the atoms of the \uf070-system can be classified alternatingly into two exclusive sets (red and green in Figure ), such that direct connections occur only between atoms of different sets. For azupyrene, such a distribution is not possible, therefore the topology of its \uf070-system is called nonalternant. This seemingly abstract difference between alternant and nonalternant isomers has important practical implications. For example, it can explain why azulene is blue, while its isomer naphthalene is colorless. Additionally, azupyrene is interesting as a molecular model for the Stone-Wales defect in graphene. In on-surface synthesis, both pyrene and azupyrene are small prototypical building blocks for alternant and nonalternant nanographenes.

Genetic algorithms are a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics in biological systems . They proceed via an iterative process involving a population of candidate solutions that undergo recombination and mutation to create new offspring solutions. A selection process based on the fitness of each solution, or model, is used to determine which solutions survive into the next generation. Just as evolutionary pressures are the primary driver for shaping the evolution of organisms, the metric used to determine each candidate model\'s ability to survive selection and go on to participate in breeding the next generation of models is of central importance to shaping the evolution of candidate models in a genetic algorithm. Since the goal is to discover network Hamiltonian models that can maximally and reliably simulate the self-assembly of amyloid fibril network structures, we define a metric for amyloid fibril production called fibril fraction , which is defined simply as the number of nodes in the system that make up part of a region of perfect amyloid fibril divided by the total number of nodes in the simulation (e.g. in Figure ).

Both the copper signal and elemental composition from the ligand remain uniform across the grown film showing effective reactivity on the substrate's surface to form a homogeneous Cu-HHTP thin film. This uniform distribution of metal active sites was desired for efficient exposure and adsorption of target analytes especially for sensing applications. Film uniformity in combination with reduced growth times is key towards the realization of 2D MOF-based electronics where continuous and highly conductive films are desirable yet challenging to process. After confirming the formation of the Cu-HHTP MOF into thin films, we probed the functionality of the material towards molecular sensing especially targeting water contaminants. It has been shown that in quaternary-coordinated MOFs, the MO4 sites tend to exhibit a residual negative charge as shown in Figure a. Furthermore, the predominant charged species is expected to readily undergo oxidative reactions without disturbing the corresponding coordination owing to the bivalent nature of the metal atoms. With abundant electron-rich sites exposed in our 2D films, we envision that Cu-HHTP would be ideal for sensing electron-deficient species. In addition, the oxygen-rich coordination sites render the Cu-HHTP MOF film predominantly hydrophilic, making it an ideal candidate towards analytes with hydrophilic ends.We thus targeted the sensing of perfluoroalkyls (PFAS) which are comprised of a hydrophilic head with an acidic hydrogen (either carboxylic or sulfonic) and a fluorine-rich hydrophobic tail. We expect such"", 'between its benzenoid and quinoid forms (Fig. ). A similar behavior is also observed when PFOS is used as the analyte (Fig. ) suggesting that in presence of PFAS, the MOF adopts its quinoid form to balance the electronic charge along its coordination sites.We also confirmed the adsorption of the PFA into the bulk of the MOF film using XPS as shown in Fig. . We carried out XPS measurements on Cu-HHTP films after casting a 10 nM PFOA solution and measuring the binding energies of F atoms. We found that at the surface, unbound or ""free"" F atoms exhibit a negligible difference (< 1 eV) in binding energy from the atoms probed after sputtering deep into the MOF film analogous to previous reports. Note that higher peak intensities were found at the surface as the majority of PFOA most likely remains on the surface upon drying. This sensitivity of the Cu-HHTP films towards the fluorinated analytes could also be visualized with the naked eye when a drop of the stock PFOS solution was dropped on a MOF-coated glass. The coloration of the MOF film showed to bleach immediately after PFOS was cast onto it (Fig ). Such change in MOF film coloration has also been shown when doping MOFs with electron-acceptors such as 2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ). We expect that the color change, and the concomitant increase in film conductivity, is due to the oxidation of Cu-HHTP by the electron-deficient analytes that can abduct electrons from the MOF\'s active sites as evidenced by our electrochemistry results.The observed oxidation of the MOF film also showed to be non-destructive for the MOF structure.', 'and a fluorine-rich hydrophobic tail. We expect such amphiphilic nature to enable strong electrostatic interactions between our Cu-HHTP films and PFAS owing to both i) the residual negative charge along the coordination sites and, ii) the hydrophilic nature of the MOF from the oxygen-rich ligand. In addition, the unique chemical structure of PFAS distinguishes them from other common water contaminants (e.g. inorganic salts) allowing the selectivity towards these larger and highly polar analytes easier to engineer. We thus tested the sensitivity of our Cu-HHTP films towards PFAS with the rationale that the electronic cloud present at each coordination nodes within the MOF would lead to strong electrostatic attractions between the MOF films and PFAS. Upon adsorption of a PFA, we expect electrostatic interactions between our electron-rich MOF and the fluorinated tail to alter the overall oxidation of Cu-HHTP. The change in film conductivity would be used for detection. This sensing mechanism was also inspired by the recent success of MOFs ( e.g. NU-1000, Cr-MIL-101) towards adsorbing PFAS in water. We aimed to enhance such adsorptive sensitivity by exposing more active metal sites on the surface of our MOF films, as opposed to the previously reported adsorb-to-capture approach in powder-based platforms. Since we expect that other oxidative pollutants might have a similar effect on the MOF, thus making selectivity a challenging task especially in ground water samples, we targeted to test the presence of PFAS in drinking water for proof of concept. Here, common pollutants (e.g. salts) have been well studied and can', ""water for proof of concept. Here, common pollutants (e.g. salts) have been well studied and can be filtered out using ubiquitous methods, but PFAS, in addition to requiring more sophisticated and costly treatment techniques (e.g. powdered activated carbon and nanofiltration), remain difficult to remove owing to their physicochemical properties, thus posing a major threat when undetected. We chose to sense the two most common PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its sulfonic acid analogue (PFOS) and tested their adsorption onto Cu-HHTP in water samples.The oxidation of Cu-HHTP was indeed observed when the MOF thin film on ITO electrodes was dipped into a sample of water contaminated by different amounts of PFOA. The current-voltage (I-V) curves in Figure b show an increase in film conductivity with increasing amount of PFOA added into the water. This increase in the current response from a two-terminal device was a first, simple, and yet clear indicator that Cu-HHTP becomes oxidized in the presence of aqueous PFAS. Cyclic voltammograms obtained with Cu-HHTP films as a working electrode (versus an Ag/AgCl reference and a Pt mesh as the counter electrode) in PBS also showed an obvious increase in the MOF's oxidation and reduction activity when pristine PBS was compared to a 10 nM PFOA solution in PBS (Fig. ). A strong and reversible oxidation peak around 0.312 V (with a reduction peak detected at -0.315 V) emerged when PFOA was added into the electrolyte. A control experiment in which the same potential was applied to the electrochemical cell, but in the absence of Cu-HHTP onto the ITO-working electrode, i.e. a bare ITO working as the working electrode, showed no redox activity from PFOA alone (Fig. ). This electrochemical behavior suggests that the observed redox activity within the scanned"", ""observed oxidation of the MOF film also showed to be non-destructive for the MOF structure. Despite the coloration change most likely due to the overall change in charge along the active site, the structure of the MOF remained intact after dipping in PFAS and washing.The elemental composition of the MOF film was found to remain unchanged as evidenced from the post-sensing XPS spectra (Fig. ). This structural stability towards the oxidative adsorption of PFAS in Cu-HHTP as well as the efficient release of sensed PFA molecules was rationalized by the fact that the key interactions between the MOF and the analyte are due to surface electrostatics that are electronically detectable yet reversible especially at low PFA concentrations. This behavior is enabled by the thin film platform we utilize as opposed to previously studied powders (oftentimes using morphological binders) that rely on the binding and trapping of the analyte. In our film-based devices, we expect a high density of the metal active sites on the surface, which would translate to a highly sensitive bind-and-release mechanism even at low analyte concentrations. We then tested the sensitivity of our MOF films towards PFAS using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a means to monitor the change in channel conductance, where spurious effects, such as resistance to current injection, don't affect sensitivity. The simple device architecture of our studied MOF-based sensor is shown in Figure a. We employ a 2-terminal device layout which has been previously shown to be effective for recording EIS changes in resistance-dominated systems.

(iii) Regardless of the concentration of acetic acid, all synthesized Zr-MOFs exhibited an amorphous fraction and a porous structure consisting of families of pores in both the micro and mesopore ranges of pore sizes. The data suggested that increasing the concentration of the organic modulator up to a critical point promoted the crystallinity of the materials as well as the formation of a larger relative fraction of mesopores of wider diameters.', 'ConclusionsThis study analyzed the effect of varying the concentration of acetic acid used as modulator during the synthesis of defective Zr-MOFs of the MOF-808 type. The main key findings in this regard were: (i) all the synthesized materials displayed a certain degree of amorphicity related to the formation of a mesoporous structure. (ii) Increasing the concentration of the employed modulator promoted the formation of a more crystalline structure without affecting the thermal stability of the material. At the same time, the porous structure of the materials was also modified as a function of the concentration of the modulator. Particularly, wider and more numerous mesopores were formed at the highest acetic acid concentration without affecting the relative proportion between the two families of micropores belonging to the inner structure of the material. (iii) Evidence suggests that the activation stage of the materials synthesis encompasses the removal of adsorbed water and organic linkers replaced by molecules of the modulator was found. On the other hand, an analysis of the effects produced by performing a conventional post-synthetic modification with sulfuric acid of a selected sample from the synthesized defective Zr-MOFs led to conclude the following: (i) sulfuric acid chemically attack the surface structure of the defective Zr-MOF leading to a sulfation of the Zr moieties and to a sulfonation of the organic functional groups besides of depositing residual sulfate ions on the surface. (ii) The attack performed by sulfuric acid enhanced the thermal stability of the Zr-MOF, but it degraded its porous and crystalline structure. Concerning the former, the collected evidence for the PSM treated Zr-MOF suggested that only the families of mesopores and the larger micropores are interconnected within the material.

Comparing these reports to our work, not only a strong influence of the nature of the modulator on the porous structure of Zr-MOFs is evidenced, but also the role of the concentration of a given modulator takes a central stage in controlling this property as well. The characteristics of the recorded isotherms show that the synthesized Zr-MOFs are micro/mesoporous materials whose pore network is affected by the concentration of the acetic acid modulator. The lower the concentration of the latter, the more complex the corresponding porous network becomes. Such a complexity seems to be related to the formation of narrow necks interconnecting the mesopores. The narrowness of these necks seemed to increase with the decrease of the acetic acid modulator concentration. According to calculations, the synthesized materials possess various families of pores whose distributions are reflected in the corresponding stepwise cumulative pore volume curves, See Figure . Particularly, ZrBTC-52.4, Figure , showed three different families of micropores. The average sizes of these families were ca.: 0.58, 0.88, and 1.53 nm. Among them, the one whose average size was 0.88 nm represented the lowest increase in cumulative pore volume. Furthermore, such a family of pores tended to disappear with the increase in the concentration of the modulator. Concerning mesopores, the increase in the concentration of the modulator led to displacement and widening of the pore size distributions in this range. The total pore volumes calculated for ZrBTC-114.6, ZrBTC-83.5, and ZrBTC-52.4 were 0.50, 0.48, and 0.30 cm 3 /g, respectively with corresponding pore volumes related to mesopores of 42.0,', '0.48, and 0.30 cm 3 /g, respectively with corresponding pore volumes related to mesopores of 42.0, 41.7, and 13.3 %. Thus, an increment in the concentration of modulator enhanced both the total and mesopores pore volume of the synthesized Zr-MOFs. Table presents the results for the calculated surface areas by the method derived from the χtheory . In general, the total surface area of the materials increased with the concentration of the organic modulator. This trend was qualitatively consistent with the one found when estimating surface area with the BET method, Table . Such a trend concurs with the fact that TGA tests pointed out to larger free volume spaces available for Zr-BTC114.6 (previous section). On the other hand, the χ-method allows calculating the surface area for the different families of pores of the material . Therefore, it was possible to determine that the surface areas corresponding to both the micropores and mesopores of the materials increased with the concentration of the organic modulator. The relative percentages of the mesopore surface area were ca. 30% for both ZrBTC-114.6 and ZrBTC-83.5, and ca. 17% for ZrBTC-52.4. Therefore, the value of this percentage seems to reach a plateau after reaching a certain value of concentration for the organic modulator. On the other hand, χ-method calculations accounted for the surface area of two families of pores; namely, surfaces 1 and 2 in Table , in the microporous region of the isotherm. Therefore, the contribution of the family of pores with an average size of 0.88 nm could not be differentiated from the others.

However, these well-known microporous materials could see restricted their applications in heterogeneous catalysis if large reactants exceed their pore sizes leading to unavailable surface areas. In this work, we studied the effect of acetic acid concentration, used as the modulator, on the formation of micro/mesoporous materials. This inclusion of a modulator during synthesis and its removal by activation process generate materials with missing linker defects. We showed that an increase in the concentration of modulator leads to an improvement of calculated apparent surface area and a modification of MOF-808 pore structure by producing mesopores at the expense of micropores. Furthermore, we performed a post-synthetic modification of the MOF-808. We observed the expected sulfation of the zirconium oxo-cluster but also the sulfonation of the organic ligand. Also, we found that only the families of mesopores and the larger micropores are interconnected within the material, and the ultramicropores seems to be isolated from the porous structure.

Such defect sites may appear when Al is close to silicon T-atom vacancy, representing the so-called silanol nest. It is formed after hydrolysis of Si-O bonds around a silicon center next to the Al (but not the Si bound to the bridging hydroxyl). In such situation the acidic proton from bridging hydroxyl is close to aluminol AlOH group and may protonate the O center from it. As a result, water molecule can be formed and after its desorption, Al(III) center will be created.We considered CO adsorption at such Al site in two models -when Al is next to silanol nest created after removal of two neighboring silicon T atoms (structure CO/Fr3) and when it is close to a larger defect site with missing four T atoms from one four-membered ring of the faujasite structure (CO/Fr2).

Note that the two latter structures are by about 1 eV less stable than the former one. As expected, the calculated CO frequencies correlate with the shortening of the C-O distance in the adsorption complex (Fig. ). Since there is not π-backdonation contribution in the Al-CO bonding, CO frequencies also correlated with the BE(CO). Despite the lack of π-backdonation, the Al carbonyl complex that forms, is notably stable.In summary, we identified a new aluminum Lewis acid site in H-FAU. This site is a naked, highly electrophilic Al +3 cation that forms in the sodalite cages of FAU upon dehydration of hydrated Al cations at elevated temperatures. This is the first identification of a bare +3 metal cation in a zeolite that compensates the charge of Al triplets to form an Al quartet. This also proves the existence of such Al triplets in siliceous H-FAU zeolite. Al +3 bare cation interacts strongly with CO, forming a stable Al +3 -CO carbonyl complex with the highest known C-O stretching frequency for any solid material. Our study reveals that isolated +3 trivalent cations can form in zeolites and provides a spectroscopic and theoretical framework to study polyvalent metal interactions with zeolites.

Furthermore, using two different caging groups in a chemical dimerizer, bidirectional photocontrol of protein localization and diffusion has been achieved in a single cycle . However, caged CID systems, in principle, cannot be repetitively switched on and off, unlike optogenetic tools.In this study, we developed a 'photochromic CID' system, which allows repetitive protein dimerization and dissociation by light. The photochromic CID system consists of two protein tags and a dimerizer tethering a covalent ligand for one tag and a photochromic ligand for the other tag. Photoreversible protein dimerization is achieved by photoisomerization of the photochromic ligand, enabling protein translocation to various subcellular compartments. This system allowed bidirectional control of protein association and diffusion by dualwavelength light irradiation and achieved fast and durable localization of the target proteins. Furthermore, the translocation level of the target protein was varied by the irradiation light wavelength or the combination of dualwavelength light with different intensities.

Our photochromic CID system showed faster kinetics than the optogenetic dimerization tools (Supplementary Table ). The observed the half-life t 1/2,on (0.78 s) in the bimolecular association process was slightly shorter than or comparable to that of the fastest optogenetic tool, although this process is dependent on the concentrations of both components. Interestingly, the t 1/2,off (< 0.3 s) in the unimolecular dissociation process was clearly shorter than that of optogenetic tools (Fig. ). Such quick-response photoswitches provide potent tools for temporally refined control of intracellular molecular dynamics, In addition, lowintensity and instantaneous irradiation (60 µW, 100 ms) was sufficient to induce and sustain protein association (Fig. ). Low-intensity and short-duration light illumination can significantly reduce cellular photodamage under sustained protein association. These properties, such as fast-switching kinetics and thermodynamically stable protein association, are attributed to the bistable photoisomers of azobenzene derivatives and can be advantageous over flavin-based optogenetic tools (Supplementary Table ). Although the chromophores available for optogenetics are limited to natural chromophores such as flavins or bilins, a variety of synthetic photochromic chromophores can be expanded in a semi-infinite chemical space to freely design the spectral and thermodynamic properties.In addition to temporal regulation, quantitative regulation is crucial for cellular responses in intracellular signaling pathways <ref type=""bibr""', 'Quantitative and Repetitive Control of Subcellular Protein-Protein Interaction Using a Photochromic Dimerizer Artificial control of intracellular protein dynamics with high precision provides deep insight into complicated biomolecular networks. Optogenetics and caged compound-based chemically induced dimerization (CID) systems are emerging as tools for spatiotemporally regulating intracellular protein dynamics. However, both technologies face several challenges for accurate control such as the duration of activation, deactivation rate, and repetition cycles. Herein, we report a photochromic CID system that employs the photoisomerization of a ligand so that both association and dissociation are controlled by light, enabling quick, repetitive, and quantitative regulation of the target protein localization upon violet and green light illumination. We also demonstrated the usability of the photochromic CID system as a potential tool to finely manipulate intracellular protein dynamics to study diverse cellular processes. Utilizing this system to manipulate PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, we showed that PINK1 recruitment to the mitochondria can promote Parkin recruitment to proceed with mitophagy.', 'regulation is crucial for cellular responses in intracellular signaling pathways . A few methods have achieved quantitative protein translocation using caged CID systems or optogenetics . In these cases, the illumination dose was adjusted to control protein translocation levels. However, fine-tuning based on the illumination dose remains challenging, especially for caged CID systems. Because of the irreversible photolysis reaction, once the protein is translocated excessively than expected, it is difficult to reduce the translocation level. The photochromic CID system implemented quantitative and repetitive recruitment of the target protein. Because the photochromic CID system is based on fast and reversible photoisomerization of the ligand, protein recruitment is quantitatively regulated by the fraction of the active Z isomer. In this study, we demonstrated quantitative control by the illumination wavelength (Fig. ) and intensity ratio of dual-wavelength illumination (Fig. ). These single-and dual-wavelengthbased regulation methods enabled the control of subcellular protein translocation with prompt response, sufficient duration, quantitativeness, and reversibility. The photochromic CID system allowed the photoreversible recruitment of PINK1 on the MOM, unlike the traditional FKBP-FRB-based CID technique . This advantage enabled investigation of the relationship between the anchoring time of PINK1 and Parkin accumulation on the MOM. We found that Parkin accumulation was accelerated only when cytPINK1 was anchored to the MOM (Fig. ). It has been reported that the phosphorylation of Parkin enhances the affinity of', 'rate could result in the loss of high temporal control. Hence, as implemented by PhyB/PIF , light-triggered bidirectional regulation has several advantages over the blue light-activation optogenetic system. However, even though the PhyB/PIF system allows excellent spatiotemporal control, it also faces other problems, such as the large size of the protein modules (99 and 11 kDa) and the bimodal absorption spectra overlapping with the excitation/emission of various fluorescent proteins , which limit their widespread use in the control of biomolecules.Another tool for regulating cellular processes is chemically induced dimerization (CID) systems furnished by chemical dimerizers, which involve two ligand moieties to induce dimerization or association of target proteins . CID systems are suitable for investigating long-term cellular events such as mitosis by sustaining protein dimers. Recently, photoactivatable or photocleavable CID systems, termed caged CID, have been reported and have attracted attention as new chemical tools for regulating intracellular protein dynamics. Caged CID systems provide a higher spatiotemporal precision than conventional CID systems. We also developed a caged covalent-CID system that maintains stable protein dimers applicable to gel electrophoresis . These caged CID systems revealed complex cellular systems, such as the specialized properties of a kinesin motor and the molecular', 'of azoMTX were replaced with -H and -CONHR (R: alkyl group) in pcDH, indicating that either or both negatively charged carboxylates enhanced the binding selectivity for the Z-form over the Eform. Based on this insight, we are improving the selectivity by derivatization of the photochromic ligand and protein engineering of eDHFR.In summary, we established a photochromic CID system, a novel methodology for the fine control of intracellular protein localization, and demonstrated the photoreversible manipulation of intracellular molecular networks associated with mitophagy. The photochromic CID strategy can not only be used as an alternative to optogenetic tools or caged CID systems, but also has a high potential for unique applications because of the exceedingly high temporal resolution and the small size of the protein tags (eDHFR: 18 kDa and HaloTag: 33 kDa). In the future, the photochromic CID strategy will open a new gateway to controlling the intracellular dynamics of endogenous proteins by light. In principle, endogenous proteins can be photoreversibly recruited to intracellular compartments, where eDHFR is expressed using a bifunctional dimerizer consisting of a specific ligand for an endogenous target protein and a photochromic eDHFR ligand. It is also promising to utilize a covalent labeling strategy for endogenous proteins . We envision that a photochromic ligand-based strategy will expand the toolbox for the spatiotemporal control of intracellular protein dynamics and contribute to broad fields of cell biology.']","['Biomedical engineering and technology', 'Regenerative medicine']",332,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.8704406508751255,0.6751779765350532,['what']

Like porphyrins, Pcs are planar and suffer from poor solubilities. However, an elegant approach to improve their physical properties has been to silylate the center of the Pc, introducing axially oriented groups that shield the aromatic surface. Beyond its effect on solubility, silylation modifies the optical and electronic profiles of Pcs, which has led to over 1000 papers discussing the synthesis, properties, and applications of silylated Pcs (Si-Pcs).

Their applications are often hindered, however, by poor solubilities that result from their extended, solvophobic aromatic surfaces. Attempts to counteract this problem by functionalizing their peripheries have been met with only limited success. Here, we demonstrate a versatile strategy to tune the physical and electronic properties of porphyrins using an axial functionalization approach. Porphyrin silanes (PorSils) and bissilyloxy PorSils (SOPS) are prepared from porphyrins by operationally simple κ 4 N-silylation protocols, introducing bulky silyloxy ""caps"" that are central and perpendicular to the planar porphyrin. While porphyrins typically form either J-or H-aggregates, SOPS do not self-associate in the same manner: the silyloxy axial substituents dramatically improve solubility by inhibiting aggregation. Moreover, axial porphyrin functionalization offers convenient handles through which optical, electronic, and structural properties of the porphyrin core can be modulated. We observe that the identity of the silyloxy substituent impacts the degree of planarity of the porphyrin in the solid state as well as the redox potentials.', 'CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKEdge-functionalized porphyrin derivatives are reliable and widely used building blocks for functional organic materials. We have demonstrated that the straightforward, high-yielding modification of porphyrins at their core is a viable alternative way to tune their properties. By silylating the porphyrin and capping with axial silyloxy substituents, we have increased porphyrin solubility and prevented aggregation-induced physicochemical phenomena. The identity of the silyloxy cap can be used to tune porphyrin planarity and molecular orbital energies. This approach offers opportunities for the customization of porphyrins through axial tuning and an improvement in the processability of porphyrins via increased solubility.

Partial 1 H NMR spectra (400 MHz, CDCl3, 298 K) of 2, 3, and 1i showing i) that aromatic resonances of the axial substituent are shifted upfield by their proximity to the porphyrin ring and ii) that HB is shifted significantly upfield in aromatic SOPS (1i). *Signal from residual CHCl3 in CDCl3.', 'on the more practical aspects of this synthesis, particularly in reference to key intermediate 2-SiCl2.While stable in open air and during neutral aqueous workup, the Si-Cl bonds in the PorSil are labile enough that reaction quickly and quantitatively occurs between 2-Si(Cl)2 and silica gel (in both column and thin-layer chromatography (TLC)). Neither the precursor (2) nor subsequent product (3) display such reactivity. This allows for facile tracking of reaction progress in either the generation of 2-SiCl2 from 2 or consumption of 2-SiCl2 to make 3, as 2-SiCl2 is completely immobile on a silica TLC plate. NMR Analysis. The NMR spectra of the synthesized SOPS provide insight into the structural and electronic characteristics of these molecules (Figure ). The quadrupole of the aromatic porphyrin shields the alkyl/aryl protons of the silyloxy axial substituents resulting in marked upfield shifts of these signals. This was not unexpected: N-H protons in 2 -which also lie in the shielded porphyrin core -are observed at -2.75 ppm and similar upfield shifts are observed for axial substituents in related PorSils and SiPcs. This shielding falls off with distance from the silane (and thus the center of the quadrupole); for example, in TPP-Si(OSiPh3)2 (1i), the signal for the ortho protons (HE) is visible at 4.69 ppm, significantly upfield from the usual aromatic region, and the signal for the meta protons (HF) is observed at 6.57 ppm (Figure ). An additional consequence is that while phenylsilanes typically have overlapping signals for the meta (HF) and para (HG) protons, such protons in these compounds (i.e. 1f-i) are completely resolved, with Δδ of 0.26-0.32 ppm. A similar effect is observed in the 13 C NMR spectra, with significant upfield shifts observed for the axial silane substituents (see', 'can react with the alumina sorbent via nucleophilic substitution of a chloride.This lack of development of PorSils is unfortunate given that peripheral ring functionalization -allowing for useful tuning of the electronic properties -is much easier to achieve for PorSils than for Si-Pcs. There have been relatively few reports of peripherally functionalized Si-Pcs. The substituted pyrroles and phthalic acids required as starting materials are synthetically challenging and scarcely commercially available. Porphyrins, on the other hand, possess bridging methines connecting their pyrrole rings that serve as convenient handles for meso substitution. This meso substitution is readily achieved by simply forming the porphyrin from commercially available aldehydes, of which there are many. Therefore, a robust procedure for κ 4 Nsilylation of porphyrin derivatives is an appealing target that would provide access to PorSil materials that combine the electronic tuneability of porphyrins with the improved physical properties of Si-Pcs.Here, we describe a straightforward and general synthetic approach to PorSils (Scheme 1), which has allowed us to elaborate them into a new class of porphyrins, bissilyloxy PorSils (SOPS). Investigation of this series of SOPS (1a-i) based on 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP, 2) revealed that the axial substituents not only serve to solubilize the porphyrin but also to tune their optical and electronic properties.', ' can adopt a variety of conformations, including ruffled and waved, which each have characteristic patterns of displacement. Of the 10 previously reported porphyrin silane crystal structures, four were close to planar (∆r < 0.15 Å: TPP-Si(OH)2 TPP-Si(CH2TMS)2, TPP-Si(CHCH2)2, and TPP-Si(CCPh)2 ) and six were clearly non-planar (∆r>>0.15 Å: [TPP-Si(THF)2] 2+ •2Cl -, 29 TPP-SiOTf2, TPP-SiMePh, TPP-SiPh2, tetrakis(p-tolyl)porphyrin-SiF2, and tetrakis(p-trifluoromethylphenyl)porphyrin-SiF2 31 ).From this set it seems as though planarity can be achieved if both i) the axial substituents are sufficiently small so as to not abut the porphyrin and ii) the axial ligand is capable of π-backbonding to provide the silicon with extra electron density and allow Si-N bonds to lengthen to planarity. For example, while a fluorine atom is certainly small, it does not effectively provide electron density to the silicon via unshared electrons. On the other hand, the phenyl substituents can more readily π-backbond to the silicon, however the ortho hydrogens have a deleterious steric interaction with the macrocyclic ring, preventing porphyrin planarization. This theory is also supported by the observed Si-N and Si-X (X = first atom of axial substituent) bond lengths: planar PorSils feature longer Si-N bonds compared to non-planar structures and the Si-X bond lengths are similar to those in tetracoordinate silanes as opposed to the elongated bonds expected in a hexacoordinate silane.

Relativistic effects are likely to play a significant role in both Hg and Xe complexes. Such effects are ""included"" implicitly in the experimental value, but in MP2+δ(T) they are treated only in the effective core potential of the basis set. See further remarks on relativistic effects below.The Lennard-Jones model can be in principle cross-checked for validity using calculated data. This is achieved by using the R cm \'s from the r B2PLYP e structures, along with the associated rotational constants, as well as the centrifugal distortion constant D B2PLYP J obtained using second-order vibrational perturbation calculations. The results are shown in Table in the Supporting information. The binding energies obtained using the supermolecular approach (ie. from E complex -E monomers ) should be identical to the Lennard-Jones model when B2PLYP-derived data is used in both. The large discrepancy between the r B2PLYP e results and all other results is due to the significant underprediction of the centrifugal', 'Binding and interaction energiesThe overall binding energy of a complex (D E ) can be defined as the experimentally observable change in the energy upon binding of the monomers. Ignoring basis set and size consistency errors, it can be thought of as the difference of the zero-point corrected energy of the complex from the sum of the zero-point corrected energies of the relaxed monomers. Alternatively, it can be thought of as a sum of the interaction energy (E int ), the deformation energy (∆E D ) and the change in the zero-point energy (∆E ZPE ). The interaction energy is widely used as a benchmark quantity for computational methods, as calculating E int requires no geometry optimisation, but just a handful of single-point energy calculations.As a first look on the trends in the interaction energies in this set, we have applied the SAPT decomposition to the B2PLYP-based r SE e geometries. The contribution of the SAPT components of the interaction energy is shown in Fig. . The interaction with the rare gases is completely dispersion dominated, with electrostatic contribution increasing slightly down the group. The sole exception is the non-rare gas Hg••OCS complex, where the interaction contains a significant induction contribution. This is likely a consequence of the charge transfer from OCS into the empty p-shell of Hg. The SAPT interaction energies are compared to the counterpoise-corrected MP2+δ(T) interaction energies at the optimized geometries in Table . Literature counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ values of E int for the Ne 8 and Ar 38 complexes, along with a CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ value for the He and Kr complexes are also shown in Table . For the lighter two complexes, the', 'Chasing experimental accuracy with wavefunction theoryThe MP2+δ(T) recipe contains a Hartree-Fock component calculated from a [3,4,5]-ζ extrapolation.The correlation energy is calculated from two components: a second-order Møller-Plesset component calculated in an extrapolated [4,5]-ζ basis, and a higher-order correlation correction obtained from a difference in CCSD(T) and MP2 energies in an extrapolated [3,4]-ζ basis.The Hartree-Fock component is likely to be converged to the complete basis set limit. The convergence of the correlation energy is not so certain, and can be improved in three ways: i) by calculating correlation at a higher level of theory, ii) by using a larger basis set or adding diffuse and/or midpoint functions, or iii) by correlating all electrons in the calculation. Higher level correlation in dispersiondominated complexes of similar interaction energies was studied by Řezač and Hobza: the CCSDT(Q) correction to a CCSD(T) energy accounts for only 1-3% of the interaction energy. Due to the enormous computational cost of CCSDT(Q) calculations, we currently cannot investigate higher order effects on this system. Basis set incompleteness at the CCSD(T)/ [3,4]-ζ level is about ∼50 mÅ in the very weakly bound Ar• • •Ar complex, and decreases to ∼5 mÅ for a more strongly bound complex, such as NH 3 • •HF. The effect of increasing basis set size in the δ(T) component of the MP2+δ(T) recipe is shown in Fig. , in the left panel. Note that the O=C••S angle in the r (2) m structure ( ) is adjusted here by assuming the OCS monomer is linear. With increasing basis set size ( ), the intermonomer distance hardly changes, and the main difference is in the O=C••Xe angle. This further confirms that the structure is likely', '. The calculated MP2+δ(T) binding energies D E are in a good agreement with the experimental values using the Lennard-Jones model for complexes up to Kr. This agreement breaks down with in heavier complexes likely due to relativistic effects. The minor disagreement in the interaction energies compared to previous CCSD(T) literature data can be explained by basis set incompleteness in the literature results. The deformation of the OCS monomer from its equilibrium structure upon complexation is predicted to be minimal, with the largest bend of 0.3 • predicted for Hg• • •OCS. The mass-dependent r (2) m structures of the Xe and Ne complexes differ significantly from the r SE e structures. The bond lengths and angles in the OCS monomer are distorted in the r ([1,2]) m fits, especially the position of the O-atom. However, with the OCS monomer constrained to its equilibrium geometry, the mass-dependent structures are likely the most accurate structures ever obtained for the two complexes. The 43 mÅ difference in the monomer separation in the MP2+δ(T) and r (2) m structures can be partially explained by the lack of diffuse functions in the cc-pwcVnZ basis sets: upon augmentation the difference drops to 15 mÅ. The closest agreement with the r (2) m structure could be obtained by adding the 4-th order relativistic correction (+δ 4 rel ) to the MP2+δ(T) results, highlighting the importance of relativistic effects. However, this procedure cannot be generally recommended, as the scalar relativistic effects are double-counted. The inclusion of diffuse functions into at least 4-ζ basis sets is a more systematic way of converging towards experimental structures.', 'symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) calculations are performed in Psi4 29 version 1.3.

The complexity of this problem increases with the size and flexibility of the system, and the challenge becomes especially difficult in the rational design of open-shell transition-metal complexes where many electronic states and nuclear degrees of freedom participate in the excited-state dynamics. The only alternative is then to screen larger numbers of compounds as is done in the present work using computer simulations for a class of near-infrared emitting vanadium(III) complexes. Starting from the mechanism of the known emitter VCl 3 (ddpd) (ddpd = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-dipyridine-2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine), we establish design principles including an increase in the ligand-field strength in the complex in order to achieve higher emission quantum yields. Based on these principles, we design a large set of complexes that are tested for larger ligandfield splitting in static quantum chemistry calculations. For the subset of complexes with increased ligand-field splitting, we then perform nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and identify two promising near-infrared emitter with potential similar or increased emission quantum yield compared to the VCl 3 (ddpd) reference.

In the second step, we then performed long-time nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. For the four complexes, we could observe similar or larger transfer of electronic population via intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet states when compared to VCl 3 (ddpd). For two of the complexes, [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and VCl 3 (im-im-im), reverse intersystem crossing subsequently depopulated the singlet states on a 20 ps time scale making them non-promising candidates for near-infra emission despite their large ligand-field splitting. For the other two complexes, however, we found long-lived singlet population that remains constant even after 100 ps simulation time. For VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), this population of ca. 7% is of the same size as that for the reference VCl 3 (ddpd) complex (9%). For [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, in turn, the long-lived singlet population is almost doubled to 16%, i.e., making it a promising candidate for efficient 3d-metal based near-infrared emitters.While following our hypothesis resulted in a success in the screening, the detailed analysis of the relaxation mechanisms of VCl 3 (ddpd) and the four designed complexes revealed a complex picture. Despite nominally featuring electronic states of similar character, each complex displayed a unique reaction network in its photodynamics. This suggested that the success in the screening did not originate by following the assumption of our hypothesis, but rather resulted from some other, more individual electronic-structure features. In conclusion, the excited-state decay pathways of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes are complicated due to the large number of participating electronic states. Consequently, the effect of changing the ligand on their mechanisms are both difficult to predict and not obvious just from static electronic calculations. Instead, insights from more vanadium(III)', 'due to their Earth-abundance are designed to become sustainable replacements for currently used near-infrared emitter based on expensive noble metals and rare earth elements. We have previously studied the photodynamics of the emissive VCl 3 (ddpd) complex using SH and LVC potentials. When excited from its triplet ground-state, the complex undergoes intersystem crossing to the singlet states which are long-lived and emit in the near-infrared region at 1111 and 1219 nm, see Figure . Our simulations revealed the mechanism behind the population of the singlet states as well as of the competing nonradiative relaxation pathways back to the triple ground state. The character of the electronic states suggested that the relaxation mechanism can be modified to increase the population in the singlet states and thus lead to larger phosphorescence quantum yields by designing ligands that induce even larger ligand-field splitting in the complex. To do this, we have modified the ligand-structure in VCl 3 (ddpd) following rules established for other 3d-complexes. We first screened their excited-state energies using different electronic structure methods, and then performed SH/LVC dynamics simulations to test our hypothesis for the four most promising complexes. Our simulations show two complexes with similar or larger singlet populations that suggest increased phosphorescence yields.', 'ConclusionThe combination of trajectory surface hopping on potentials parametrized in the linear vibronic coupling model is an efficient approach to perform photodynamics simulations. For transition metal complexes, despite their typically large number of vibrational degrees of freedom and many close-lying electronic states, it becomes affordable to screen the nonadiabatic dynamics of many individual ones in order to test and establish design principles to improve their photophysical and photochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate this by screening the photophysics of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes derived from VCl 3 (ddpd). This complex, after excitation from the triplet ground state and following intersystem crossing to the singlet manifold, shows singlet-to-triplet phosphorescence in the nearinfrared region. Based on an analysis of the relaxation mechanism of VCl 3 (ddpd), we developed the hypothesis that by increasing the ligand-field strength in the complex could shift the electronic states to modify the mechanism in such a way as to lead to a higher phosphorescence yield. This was to be achieved by channeling more population from the triplet to the singlet states as well as reducing the amount of singlet-to-triplet reverse intersystem crossing that reduces the population available for phosphorescence.We then tested our hypothesis in two steps. First, we designed 18 complexes based on design principles established for other 3dmetal complexes with large ligand-field splitting. Thereby we found that strategies of including ligands that are strong σ -donors or both σ and π donors are particularly successful. Among the 18 candidates complexes, we identified four complexes with ligandfield splitting', 'requirements become de facto bottlenecks for any attempts at screening photodynamics, and they are more severe for transition-metal complexes which typically need more sophisticated and costly electronic structure methods compared to organic molecules.One possibility to evade this bottleneck is to construct analytical, parametrized models of the potential energy surfaces. Most prominently, large advances towards this goal have been realized using machine learning techniques. Applied to electronically excited states, on-the-fly computed machine-learning potentials have both enabled nanosecond-timescale nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and screening of large compounds classes of organic molecules. For excited-state properties of transition-metal complexes, machine-learning approaches so far are scarce and lacking behind. In this light, the combination of potentials parametrized using the vibronic coupling model and trajectory surface hopping (SH) for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations has become an affordable pathway to investigate photodynamics, in particular of transition-metal complexes. In vibronic', 'Design of the ComplexesOur strategy to find near-infrared emitting vanadium(III) complexes with larger photoluminescence yields, is to design complexes with larger ligand-field splitting than VCl 3 (ddpd). The problem of achieving larger ligand-field splitting in first-row transition metal complexes is a common one in current efforts to find replacements using Earth-abundant 3d metals for efficient heavymetal-based chromophores. 40,45-47 Thus, we can base our design on some of the principles that have already been established to achieve very large ligand-field splitting in first-row transitionmetal complexes. In particular, we have employed the five design principles depicted in Figure (ii) high coordination symmetry close to the ideal octahedral one to maximize the overlap/repulsion between metal and ligand orbitals , (iii) strong π-acceptor ligands to stabilize the t 2g orbitals , (iv) combining strong σ -and π-donating properties in cyclometalating ligands , and (v) using stronger σ -donors instead of the Cl -ligands following the spectrochemical series.Following the above principles, we initially designed 25 complexes.

To the best of our knowledge, this kind of reaction has never been described before and represents a new type of crossover system.

These are the closest examples of similar sulfinamide reactivity. Encouraged by the initial results, we set off to determine the scope of this reaction. First, the N-substituents were varied. Various tertiary sulfinamides with cyclic and acyclic aliphatic N-substituents underwent the crossover reaction with high yields, resulting in an almost equimolar mixture of products as determined by HPLC (Fig. ).

Leveraging mild acid catalysis, the reaction demonstrates high tolerance to structural variations, yielding equimolar products across diverse sulfinamide substrates.

This crossover chemotype provides a new tool for high-throughput experimentation in discovery chemistry.A crossover reaction is typically associated with biological systems where two DNA molecules can swap pieces of their sequences (Fig. ). This enzyme-catalyzed biological crossover is an essential part of sexual reproduction and one of the major drivers of the evolution of sexual organisms. In chemistry, certain functional group's reactions follow the same path of crossing over their substituents (Fig. ).For instance, alkene cross-metathesis or disulfide exchange are examples of such reactions that enable swapping substituents under metal and thiol catalysis, respectively. Several such reactions in chemistry have been heavily utilized in the field of dynamic combinatorial libraries (Fig. ). <ref"", 'of these experiments indicates that regardless of the starting substrates, the reactions lead to an equilibrium of almost equimolar amounts of products. This indicates that the thermodynamic stability of the given sulfinamides is similar, and the steric/electronic effects do not play a major role, at least for the substrates tested. It should be noted that the reaction also proceeds in other solvents than DMSO, such as toluene or acetonitrile. However, DMSO turned out to be the most general solvent in terms of the solubility of both substrates and products. Oftentimes, substrates were well soluble in each solvent, however, the resulting mixture of products after the crossover led to the crystallization of products that complicated further analysis. In terms of limitations, primary sulfinamides undergo the crossover reaction, however with a significant amount of side-products. Also, sulfinamides with electron-rich aromatic N-substituents led to unwanted side-products of the same mass, as indicated by HPLC-MS analysis. These observations are consistent with the reports on acid-catalyzed rearrangement of N-aromatic sulfinamides to sulfoxides. Also, we tested the crossover reaction conditions between sulfinamide and sulfonamide. As expected, no significant reaction was observed after a prolonged reaction time.

All', 'and the crossover reaction was performed with six sets of three different sulfinamides. All six reactions led to the formation of nine expected products with a very similar ratio of products and close to equimolar representation (Fig. ). HPLC traces of the crossover reactions indicated that regardless of the initial combination of substrates, a good yield of all the combinatorial products with only a minimal amount of side-products is achieved. These experiments corroborated that the sulfinamide crossover is suitable for generation a new type of dynamic combinatorial libraries. It should be pointed out that sulfinamides are generally stable compounds in neutral and basic aqueous environment. Therefore, the resulting libraries are compatible with biochemical binding assays. The limited stability in acidic aqueous buffers and possible biological oxidation can be a limiting factor in more complex biological experiments. We hypothesized that freezing the libraries by oxidation to sulfonamides would provide stable compounds of relevance in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, we subjected the mini-library of nine sulfinamides to mild oxidation with mCPBA.Delightfully, the oxidation proceeded smoothly, providing an expected set of nine sulfonamides with minimum side-products (see SI). Also, we confirmed the expected boost in stability of sulfonamides compared to sulfinamides under acidic aqueous conditions (see SI).The crossover reaction described offers a new principle that has transformative potential in the field of discovery chemistry. The simplicity and generality of the new crossover reaction make it suitable for applications spanning fields from supramolecular to medicinal chemistry.

This work focuses on the remaining component of the force field, namely the re-fitting of key torsional parameters that describe the backbone and sidechain dynamics of an amino acid. The methods and validation tests broadly follow the approaches employed in the development of OPLS-AA/M, the latest OPLS force field. Torsional parameters are fit by minimizing the differences between multiple QM and MM potential energy scans of dipeptide backbone and sidechain dihedral angles. Our overall goal is to test the extent to which bespoke non-bonded parameters may be combined with libraries of bonded parameters to produce a protein force field that is compatible with our QUBE small molecule force field for use in computer-aided drug design applications.The performance of the QUBE protein force field is tested through comparisons between experiment and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a set of twenty dipeptides, the glycine tripeptide and alanine pentapeptide, and a range of small folded proteins. This benchmark testset is similar to those used in the development of protein force fields such as AMBER ff15ipq, AMOEBA, CHARMM36 and OPLS-AA/M. As we shall show, the QUBE protein force field is competitive with standard transferable force fields for the dipeptide set and alanine', 'Fitting Dipeptide Torsional ParametersTorsional parameters were optimized by minimizing the error function shown in eq 5 using asteepest descent algorithm. MM potential energy surfaces were computed by scanning dihedral angles in 15 • increments using the BOSS software. The backbone torsional parameters for all dipeptides tested, excluding serine and threonine, were fit to the alanine and glycine scans previously described. The total error for the two scans was given by:Error Total = 0.928 × Error Ala + 0.072 × Error Gly (6)  with the prefactors corresponding to the relative frequency of each amino acid in the human proteome. Preliminary testing (Section S1.1) showed that a weighting function and regularization did not significantly improve the conformations sampled during the dipeptide MD simulations and so were not used (λ = 0, W = 0).The remaining dipeptides, threonine and serine (both of which contain aliphatic hydroxyl groups in their sidechain), were assigned identical backbone parameters that were fit to reproduce the QM scans of serine. For these scans, regularization and weighting were shown to be necessary to produce dipeptide dynamics which were in agreement with experiment.An investigation of how the simulation error changes with regularization is given in Section S1.2. The harmonic restraint parameter was set to λ = 0.05.The sidechain scans for all dipeptides followed the same fitting process as the alanine/glycine backbone with no weighting or regularization used. As atom-typing is not used for the non-bonded parameter assignment in the QUBE force field, each set of sidechain torsional parameters is also residue-specific. This differs from the approach used in OPLS-AA/M in which sidechain torsional parameters with the same set of atom types are generally assigned the same parameters.In a number of cases', 'the same set of atom types are generally assigned the same parameters.In a number of cases it was necessary to make manual changes to the fitting process.This was restricted to setting a number of torsion parameters to zero (that is, λ = ∞) and reducing the number of scans used in the fitting process. In particular, the aspartic acid ψ/φ distribution was improved by setting the χ 2 torsional parameters to zero. Additionally, using only the QM energy scan with the lowest minimum energy in the fitting process was shown to result in an improvement in the MD simulations of the dipeptides for the χ 1 torsional parameters of cysteine, methionine, serine and threonine. The need for manual input in the fitting process was also required for developing OPLS-AA/M and is likely due to the restrictive functional form of the torsional potential and the conformational dependence of the energy scans. The full set of manual changes involved is listed, along with the final torsional parameters, in Section S3.3.', 'Torsional Parameter FittingThe final backbone torsional parameters and associated errors in the recreation of the QM energy scans are given in Section S3.2 of the Supporting Information. For the alanine and glycine scans, the error for the QUBE force field evaluated using eq 5 is 1.25 kcal/mol compared to 0.93 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M, which is a reasonable level of agreement. For proline and serine, the errors remain comparable to OPLS-AA/M.For the sidechain torsional parameters (Section S3.3), the mean error in the recreation of the QM potential energy scans for the QUBE force field is 1.29 kcal/mol, compared to 1.12 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M. Particularly high errors occur for both the χ 1 and χ 2 glutamic acid scans, and the glutamine χ 2 scan. For glutamic acid, the error is also high for the OPLS-AA/M force field parameters, but the rotamer populations remained close to the experimental data, and this may be due to a problem with the functional form used in classical force fields. The OPLS-AA/M error in the potential energy scan for glutamine is roughly half that of the QUBE force field. However, as we will show, the accuracy of the glutamine dipeptide MD simulations is good, and so no further refinement was made to the sidechain torsional parameters in this work.Although a low error in the reproduction of the QM potential energy surface is clearly the desired result, this does not necessarily correspond to accurate non-bonded force field parameters. The degree to which torsional parameters can improve the fit between MM and QM scans depends not only on the accuracy of the non-bonded, and bond and angle, parameters, but also on the shape of the energy difference between the QM and MM scans.The functional form used in classical MM force fields is very restrictive. However, the energy difference between the QM and MM energy scans must be', 'Torsional Parameters(C-N-C α -C), φ (C-N-C α -C β ), ψ (N-C α -C-N) , ψ (C β -C α -C-N), χ 1 (N-C α -C β -X γ ), χ 1 (C-C α -C β -X γ ) and χ 2 (C α -C β -X γ -Y δ ). XTherefore, we make the assumption that the derived parameters for dipeptides are transferable to proteins, and in Section 4 we test the limitations of this assumption by validating the force field against experimental peptide and protein dynamical observables.The torsional terms in a force field are a function of the dihedral angles (φ) in a molecule.Here, we use the same functional form as the OPLS force field:V tors = k V k 1 2 (1 + cos(φ k )) + V k 2 2 (1 -cos(2φ k )) + V k 3 2 (1 + cos(3φ k )) + V k 4 2 (1 -cos(4φ k )) (4)where the sum runs over all dihedrals (k) in the molecule and V k 1-4 are parameters to be fit. We focus on reparameterizing the backbone (φ, φ , ψ and ψ ) and sidechain (χ 1 , χ 1 , χ 2 and χ 2 ) torsional parameters (Figure ). Re-fitting of the remaining torsional and improper parameters are beyond the scope of the current work, and these parameters are instead taken from the OPLS-AA/M force field. However, parallel efforts are being made to develop a toolkit for automated parameterization of small molecules using the QUBE force field, which will facilitate derivation of the remaining parameters in future. When fitting torsional parameters, the main objective is to minimize the difference between MM and QM gas phase dihedral energy scans. However, weighting schemes and regularization can also be used to change the form of the error function that is minimized.Regularization is a technique generally used to prevent overfitting to data.

As the spread of the 1869 literature was not that rapid at those times, and the production of new substances rose exponentially , scientists were hardly aware of the most recent results. For example, Mendeleev wrote in his 1869 extended publication about the system: ""So far, bismuth has not been combined with hydrogen as have the elements similar to it"" . However, BiH 3 had been synthesized in 1843 . For Mendeleev, elements similar to Bi were U, Sb, As, P and N (Table ), which by 1869 had known hydrides of similar compositions: SbH 3 , AsH 3 , PH 3 and NH 3 (UH 3 was reported in 1949 ).

Aiming at presenting mid 19th century chemical knowledge to chemistry students, Meyer and Mendeleev embarked on writing textbooks from which their periodic systems arose . These systems, as stated by Mendeleev , were based on similarity and order relationships among elements, which underlie the mathematical structure of every possible system . Meyer and Mendeleev addressed similarity and order using the available chemical compounds by the 1860s, which constitute the chemical space at that time. Here we explore the size and diversity of this space and its influence upon the periodic system.', 'than half of the formulae (4,876), about the same proportion of similarities is obtained; mainly among main group elements, having by far more formulae of few combinations than transition metals.Meyer\'s and Mendeleev\'s similarities for chemical elements are shown in Table  . Mendeleev explained that in his 1869 table ""in certain parts of the system the similarity between members of the horizontal rows will have to be considered, but in other parts, the similarity between members of the vertical columns"" . By contrasting Table with Figures and, we found that Meyer\'s and Mendeleev\'s similarities match to a large extent with the similarities arising from the chemical space, especially for main group elements. Their mismatches occur for transition metals, where deep knowledge of the space was necessary to detect the subtle differences among these elements.To conclude, our results show the enormous bias of the chemical space by 1869 towards organic compounds, which populated the exponentially growing space in the last 40 years and tilted the scale of compounds in their favour. Before evident relevance of organic compounds, the space had a more homogeneous mixture of inorganic and organic compounds .The size and diversity of the space shows that with knowledge of organogenic elements, chemists would have gauged a representative part of the space. In fact, random knowledge of about half of the space would have led to about half of the similarities resulting from the space, mainly for main group elements. This justifies the almost invariable resemblances among chemical elements reported by Meyer and', 'Similarities arising from the chemical spaceGranted the ordering of elements by atomic weight, we only need to determine the similarities among chemical elements arising from the available chemical space by 1869 to obtain the periodic system at that time . We addressed similarity using Meyer\'s and Mendeleev\'s approach based on compounds. Although we keep the spirit of our previous approaches , here we consider key features of chemical similarity that have been disregarded before. As Mendeleev stated: ""The elements, which are most chemically analogous, are characterised by the fact of their giving compounds of similar form RX n "" , an example of such common formula for similar elements is R 2 O, where R is an alkali metal. This similarity statement can be interpreted as the degree of replaceability of element x in the formulae of compounds of y and the converse, whenever x and y are similar. From compounds of the chemical space, we extracted their different formulae. To quantify the similarity of element x regarding element y, we took each formula containing x and replaced x by the symbol A. The resulting formula was arranged by lexicographic order. Likewise, y was replaced by A in its formulae, which were lexicographically ordered (Figure ). The similarity of x regarding y was quantified as the fraction of arranged formulae that x shares with y. This is an asymmetric relation, as shown in Figure , where Be is more similar to Mg (s(Be → Mg)) than the converse (s(Mg→Be)). This occurs as four of the six Be arranged formulae are shared with Mg, whereas four of the seven Mg formulae are shared with Be. In fact, by considering the actual space by 1869, the asymmetry strengthed as s(Be → Mg)=24/49=0.49, while s(Mg → Be)=24/296=0.081. Thus, in', ""and NH 3 (UH 3 was reported in 1949 ). Moreover, Mendeleev acknowledged little knowledge about In , but there were already reports of more than 20 of its compounds.The question that arises is how knowledge, or ignorance, of the chemical space may have affected the periodic system. We addressed the question by retrieving information from Reaxys from 1771 up to 1868 (included), which amounts to 26,502 single-step reactions and 11,484 substances, mainly reported in Gmelins Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie and gathered from leading 19th century journals, such as Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, Journal für praktische Chemie, Annalen der Physik, Annales de Chimie, Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Seances de l'Academie des Sciences, Jahresbericht über die Fortschritte der Chemie und Verwandter Theile Anderer Wissenschaften and Journal of the Chemical Society among others.

Meyer's 1870 paper does not include H, La, Ce, Th and U , whereas Mendeleev's first 1869 publication included them plus Er, Yt and Di . Er and Yt, along with In, were elements whose identity was questioned by Mendeleev and expressed as ?Er, ?Yt and ?In in his table. Yt was the symbol used until 1920 for Y and the first Y (or Yt) reaction is from 1872. Thus, neither Meyer nor Mendeleev had clear information about the element. Er was also problematic. By 1868 it was ignored that Er was actually a mixture of an element later (1878) coined Er and Yb, which were separated one year later into the current Er, Ho and Tm; and Sc and a Yb,"", ""This justifies the almost invariable resemblances among chemical elements reported by Meyer and Mendeleev and others and the difficulty in finding stable similarities for transition metals , characterised by few compounds, therefore requiring a more complete knowledge of the space.Meyer's and Mendeleev's idea of a book concentrating the most salient features of mid 19th century chemical knowledge, from which the periodic system arose, could have concentrated their content on oxoacid salts, halides, sulphides, simple carbon oxygenated compounds, ammonia derivatives and oxides, which are the carriers of most of the similarities among chemical elements.

The impinging single sheets and resulting mixed sheet were illuminated by a 365 nm UV light panel with dimensions of 8 cm x 12 cm. Since the UV source power was not constant over the entire mixed sheet, equation 21 was not used for calculating the fluorescence at any point in the mixed sheet. Only general predictions from the equation such as a proportionality between 𝐹𝐼 and the path length (at a specific point in the mixed sheet) were used for analysis of the results.Instead, the relative nature of fluorescence indicated that the fluorescence intensity of a mixed sheet produced from the impingement of acid and base could be compared to the fluorescence intensity of the impingement of buffers or constant pH reference solutions. The relationship between fluorescence intensity and hydroxide ion (or hydrogen ion) concentration was determined by self-impinging identical reference solutions of known pH (i.e impinging single sheets of the same solution at one another).

For the acid-base impingement, the fluorescence profiles were additionally affected by the pH, which varied along a radial line indicating the progress of the neutralization reaction.The background-adjusted, fluorescence intensity profiles for all photographs of the impinging solutions in the stack shown in Figure is illustrated in Figure . Since the velocity in the mixed sheet was constant, the time traveled by the liquid along the radial line shown in Figure , as measured from the impingement zone, was simply equal to the pixel distance from the impingement zone (𝑟) divided by the mixed sheet velocity (𝑣 𝑚 ).Figure illustrates that the collision of the liquids causes the fluorescence intensity to rapidly increase and peak in the impingement zone, especially for the acid-base mixture and for the neutral and basic mixtures (pH 7, pH 8, and pH 10). Once the liquid leaves the impingement zone, there is a rapid decay in fluorescence intensity. However, the figure shows that the slope of the decay for the acid-base impingement is steeper than the slope of decay for the constant pH solutions. In Figure , for example, after 1.8 ms, the acid-base mixed sheet fluoresced as if the average pH were 7. At about 10 ms, the acid-base mixture fluoresced as if the average pH were equal to 6.0. At any pixel along the radial line shown in Figure , fluorescence intensities (𝐹𝐼) for the constant pH solutions allow for a 𝐹𝐼 versus [𝑂𝐻 -] chart to be plotted. Figure plots 𝐹𝐼 versus [𝑂𝐻 -] at 𝑟 = 500 on Figure for the constant pH solutions only. As expected, this plot is typical of an acid-base titration', ""Calculation of the mixed sheet fluorescenceThe determination of the fluorescence of the diffusive slab thickness (2𝐿) and mixed sheet is based on the assumption that fluorescence is an additive property . Thus, the calculated fluorescence for the diffusive slab thickness is the sum of the fluorescence calculated for each slice into which 2𝐿 is divided. The hydroxide ion concentration of each slice is calculated from the simulation of Fick's Law and the fluorescence is then determined from the fluorescence vs [𝑂𝐻 -] equation (Eq. 23) that applies to the specific pixel distance (𝑟) along the radial line. However, as noted earlier, the calculated value from Eq. 23 needs to be adjusted to account for the different path lengths of 𝛥𝑦, 2𝐿 and 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 .The simulation moves forward at a time step (𝛥𝑡) that was typically about 1/10 th of the time between pixels (𝛥𝑡 𝑟 ). The time between pixels in the mixed sheet is the distance between each pixel (or pixel size) divided by the constant velocity in the mixed sheet. The fluorescence equation only changes with each advancement to the next pixel (𝛥𝑡 𝑟 ). Therefore, the calculation of the hydroxyl ion concentration profiles in 2𝐿 is accomplished about ten times as often as the fluorescence equation changes. To synchronize 𝛥𝑡 with 𝛥𝑡 𝑟 , a rounding up technique was used.For 𝛥𝑡 𝑟 = 10𝛥𝑡, the first five advancements of 𝛥𝑡 used the 4PL equation that applied to pixel 𝑟 0 . Advancements 6 through 15 used the 4PL equation which applied to pixel 𝑟 1 ; 16 through 25 used the 4PL equation for pixel 𝑟 2 , and so on. Although the 4PL equation is the same for approximately 10 consecutive increments of the simulation time, the concentration profiles changed for each increment in 𝛥𝑡 and therefore the fluorescence value for each slice also changed.Since the fluorescence intensity is a function of path length at a"", 'along the radial line at a distance 𝑟 from the impingement zone. Therefore, a comparison of experimental results and simulation results requires that the simulation calculate the fluorescence for the mixed sheet (MS) and not just the slab thickness along the radial line.

The initial reference is the fluorescence (𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 ) from a mixed sheet at a distance 𝑟 and at a constant [𝑂𝐻 -] equal to the [𝑂𝐻 -] of interest. This fluorescence is calculated from the fluorescence intensity vs [𝑂𝐻 -] equation (Eq. 23).

CONCLUDING REMARKSSurprisal analysis of experimental distributions in physics, chemistry and biology can often be characterized even by a single dominant constraint. A very recent example is the analysis of COVID19 patient gene expression samples to identify a single constraint, a gene module, that strongly aligns with disease severity. In the present work we develop an approach that allows to extract the dominant constraints for different scenarios of the coherent quantum dynamics on multiple electronic states. We show that such an approximate but compact treatment of the density provides good accuracy for both electronic and vibrational population and coherence dynamics.A density operator that is an exponential function of the constraints is a central result of the maximal entropy formalism. It follows that the surprisal, the logarithm of the density, is then a linear function of the operators of the constraints. The linearity allows a ready analysis of the importance of each constraint in the description of the density, in contrast to the density operator which is an exponential function of the not necessarily commuting constraints. In practice the expansion of the surprisal is analogous to the computation of the coefficients of the linear expansion of a function in an orthonormal basis set, with the key difference that here instead of the functions in Hilbert space we use operators as basis vectors in Liouville space.By direct propagation of the surprisal we obtain the matrix of the surprisal at different times of the dynamics. It is a general procedure and allows describing dynamics for any type of the potential and interstate coupling. We then evaluate the Lagrange multipliers -the coefficients of the chosen set of constraints, using the orthogonality relations established for this set of operators. We discuss both the cases when the algebra is', 'it can only cover a finite time interval. A coupling of the system to its environment can also be described by the Lie algebraic technique that we use but such an application of the surprisal as an exact numerical tool remain to be implemented in detail.We develop an approach where the time-evolution of a quantum system is provided through the surprisal of the density matrix, . The propagation of the surprisal in time is described by the same evolution operator as the propagation of the density matrix. We also seek to make a bridge to empirical surprisal analysis. In these practical applications approximate compact representations of the surprisal were usefully applied to characterize dominant behavior patterns in complex systems. The characterization of a system using the logarithm of its probability distribution was pioneered already by Gibbs and Boltzmann. The statistical notion of entropy was introduced by Boltzmann as a logarithmic measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied. Gibbs described the properties of the canonical ensemble showing that it is characterized by the minimum of \'-entropy\'. The quantum mechanical foundations of these thermodynamic ideas are given in detail in chapter V of Ref. 15 and are discussed critically by Already in the Boltzmann\'s ""method of the most probable distribution"" one can identify the main idea that accompanied surprisal along its historical path -the idea of asking only questions about properties of the system that are reproducible in many experimental replications. The connection to information theory can be made by special reference to the first coding theorem of Shannon. The quantum mechanical analog of the coding theorem is by ˆÎ lnr = -Schumacher. It', 'B. Expansion of the surprisal via a finite set of constraintsWe discuss three different motivations for representing the density as an exponential function of a sum of operators and determine a condition under which the three representations are equivalent and when they are dynamically exact. The simplest to state is an inference of the density matrix at time t by the maximum entropy formalism. We seek the density that is of maximal entropy given the constraint that the density is normalized and is consistent with the mean values of Hermitian observables indexed by k. It is convenient to include a k = 0 term as the condition of normalization, or .In the specific example of a thermal state, the mean energy of the system, , plays a role of the only constraint, besides normalization.

The Lagrange multipliers are time-dependent if the mean values assume different values for different times.We next consider two other derivations of a density matrix that also are of an exponential form like Eq. ( <ref', 'two other derivations of a density matrix that also are of an exponential form like Eq. ( ) but where the motivation is tightly connected to the dynamics. In a theoretical or computational discussion, one often initiates the dynamics from a pure state. But in reality, the initial state is often a mixture and then it makes sense to start from an initial density of maximal entropy subject to those constraints that govern the yet unperturbed state,. For such an initial state we now show that the exact time evolution of the density or of the surprisal is described with a finite number of time-dependent constraints with time independent Lagrange multipliers. The proof requires the unitarity of the time evolution operator and a series expansion of the exponential:(The time-dependent constraints are the terms in the curly brackets, and there are as many time-dependent constraints as the number of constraints in the initial state. In section III we discuss how to compute directly the surprisal:The method of computing the surprisal can also be applied should we wish to obtain explicit expressions for the individual time-dependent constraints.We next come to a simpler but more specialized result. It is valid for the special case when the dynamics of the constraints are closed under commutation relation with the Hamiltonian.In such a limiting situation the exact time evolution can be described with a finite number of time-independent constraints but with time dependent Lagrange multipliers with known equations of motion.

In particular we identify leading or 'dominant' constraints. This approximate treatment follows the spirit of the information theory approach -description of the density matrix using only a partial but essential knowledge about the system.To discuss systems with more than a few degrees of freedom a large basis is needed for numerical convergence. So exact propagation of the surprisal on a finite basis will be computationally demanding. However, the dynamics of the Lagrange multipliers of the dominant constraints may be sufficient for most purposes. This opens a different way of approximating the quantum dynamics in many-body systems, a subject for future research.In section II we show that if the initial state of a system is described as a state of maximal entropy, a finite set of time-dependent constraints is sufficient to reproduce the surprisal at all subsequent times. During a unitary time-evolution the rank of the density matrix is conserved so the number of the time-dependent constraints is the same as the number of constraints on the initial state. In section II we further describe the special circumstances where an algebraically delineated finite set of time-independent constraints is sufficient to describe the dynamics. The algebraic procedure to convert the dynamics of the surprisal to a compact evolution of the Lagrange multipliers is introduced.

In the former case, there is a cluster of data near d GDS = 0, consistent with the surface propensity of I -(aq), however the corresponding VIEs are spread over a range that is not dissimilar from the spread of the entire data set. This is consistent with the similarity between bulk and interfacial VIE distributions that was documented in Fig. . It is difficult to see any correlations at all in the n HB versus VIE data. While transient fluctuations in the hydrogen-bond network are no doubt the origin of the inhomogeneous broadening of the VIE distribution, it is not so simple as saying that fewer hydrogen bonds to the ion implies a larger or smaller VIE, especially with a metric that discretizes the ion's hydra- tion shell into an integer number of hydrogen bonds.In previous MD simulations of halide ions A -(aq) at the air/water interface, Jungwirth and Tobias reported that the larger halides exhibit distinctive differences in terms of how their ion-water hydrogen bonds are oriented with respect to the surface normal, when compared to the same ions in bulk water. In that work, orientation with respect to the surface normal vector r ⊥ was measured in terms of the angle it makes with r XO , examiningcos Θ AO⊥ = r AO • r ⊥ r AO • r ⊥ .We have analyzed our I -(aq) and SCN -(aq) simulations in the same way, examining the distribution of cos( ΘAO⊥ ), where ΘAO⊥ denotes the average value of Θ AO⊥ considering each of the n HB anion-oxygen vectors r AO around the ion.

Unlike the data in Table2and Fig.6, which are averages over all of the ion-water hydrogen bonds in a given snapshot (affording values denoted rHB and θHB), these two-dimensional histograms include all of the ion-water hydrogen bonds, without averaging. The partition between bulk and interfacial regions of the periodic slab is defined by the criterion GDS -3 Å.', '-, we take A = N.) Distributions of cos( ΘAO⊥ ) are plotted in Fig. , separately for the the bulk and interfacial portions of the periodic slab data, with the latter partitioned using different definitions of the interfacial region, as in Fig. . Results for I -(aq) are similar to what was reported in Ref. 11.For both I -(aq) and SCN -(aq), we find that r AO preferentially aligns towards the surface when the ion is in the interfacial region, whereas the distribution of angles is more isotropic when the ion resides in the interior of the slab. However, this alignment has seemingly no effect on the VIE. This is evident from Fig. , which presents a scatter plot of VIE versus cos( ΘAO⊥ ), analogous to the scatter plots in Fig. , and also from Fig. , which plots a joint probability distribution in VIE and cos Θ AO⊥ , stripping away the averaging over first-shell hydrogen bonds. Listed in Table are the average structural parame-ters for I -(aq), SCN -(aq), and two other ions that exhibit surface propensity (NO - 3 and ClO - 4 ), along with one that does not (NO - 2 ) as a point of comparison.

VSFG experiments demonstrate that both ions have significant effects on the O-H stretching band of water. Halides ions were considered extensively in the very earliest studies of interfacial ion partitioning, 1,7 but SCN -(aq) at the air/water interface has also been considered in numerous studies. The latter ion has also been considered in the context of Hofmeister ""salting-out"" effects on proteins. For I -(aq), our DFT/PEqS calculations afford a VIE of 8.07 ± 0.28 eV in bulk simulations where there is no interface, as compared to 8.14±0.31 eV using snapshots extracted from the periodic slab calculations. (Uncertainties represent one standard deviation and characterize inhomogeneous broadening.) Both values are consistent with the experimental VIE, 7.93 eV. In case of SCN -(aq), bulk and slab simulations afford VIEs of 8.28 ± 0.27 eV and 8.44±0.29 eV, respectively, as compared to an experimental VIE of 8.17 eV. For both ions, the difference in the average VIE in the bulk versus the slab simulation is less than the half-width of the VIE distribution obtained upon thermal sampling.That said, interfacial VIEs reported in Table represent averages over the entire periodic slab, and both I -(aq) and SCN -(aq) visit both the interfacial and the bulk-like interior regions of the slab. Supposing that the two regions were to afford very', 'average number of ion-water hydrogen bonds is remarkably similar in both environments. The value of n HB at the interface does decrease by about one full hydrogen bond for I -and NO - 3 , but is essentially unchanged for ClO - 4 and SCN -. Values of rHB and θHB are essentially identical in both environments, for each of these ions. In particular, the ion-water hydrogen bonds are just as close to linearity (θ HB = 0) at the air/water interface as they are in bulk water.Compelling similarities between ion-water structural parameters in the bulk and interfacial environments come into better focus when presented in the form of radar shown for both the bulk and interfacial regions of a periodic slab simulation (defined based on a GDS -3 Å partition), and also for an isotropic bulk simulation. Numerical data can be found in Table and similar plots for NO - 3 (aq) and ClO - 4 (aq) can be found in Fig. . plots; see Fig. for I -and SCN -, and Fig. for NO - 3 and ClO - 4 . Apart from differences in the total first-and second-shell coordination numbers, which are manifestations of the reduced water density at the interface, the solvation structure is remarkably similar and this imparts a corresponding similarity upon the VIEs obtained from bulk versus interfacial regions of the water slab. The radar plots also compare averages obtained from bulklike interior region of the slab to those obtained from the isotropic bulk simulations that have no air/water interface. This comparison demonstrate that our preferred partition of the slab (GDS -3 Å) affords a genuinely bulk-like region, where average structure parameters are indistinguishable from those computed in the isotropic simulations.Structural parameters rHB and θHB represent averages over all n HB ion-water hydrogen bonds in a given snapshot, but Fig. <ref type=""figure""']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Theoretical methods']",2742,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.965447957381288,-2.220446049250313e-16,"['how', 'compare']"
290,"NN potentials would have large uncertainty for configurations of these regions. Based on this fact, Behler and co-workers exploited the high flexibility of the NN to search the poorly sampled regions of the configuration space. Namely, if some points possess large energy deviations between two NN fits, they were added to the training set. Recently, Lin et al. proposed a trajectory-free active learning method, based on this idea, to iteratively add new data points for sampling. It has been demonstrated that an accurate PES can be developed with much fewer points than the trajectory-based methods.In this work, we also utilize the limited extrapolation capabilities of NN potential to select points from the DFT dataset. First, 1500 points were chosen from the DFT dataset and then calculated to obtain their electronic energies at the UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ level.

Within the current strategy, these regions can be easily patched up by low-level computations. After a set of tests, the two hidden layers of NN were chosen to be 20 and 80, respectively, for fitting PESL, ΔVHL-LL, and PESH, each with 5641 fitting parameters. To minimize the random errors, the correction PES and the final PESH were chosen as the average of four and two best fittings, respectively. The RMSEs for PESL, ΔVHL-LL, and PESH are 0.20, 0.13, and 0.17 kcal mol - 1 , respectively. The fitting errors of PESL are shown in Figure as a function of the DFT energy.(As seen, the fitting errors are evenly distributed in the energy up to 120 kcal mol -1 , and roughly 80% of the points have very low fitting errors that are less than 0.1 kcal mol -1 .

As can be seen, most absolute energy differences (85%) are less than 5 kcal mol -1 . A small portion of differences are larger than 10 kcal mol -1 . Most of these configurations are highly distorted and thus lead to large differences between UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ and M06-2X/AVTZ. However, these configurations are necessary to obtain convergence of the', 'the correction PES ΔVHL-LL , their UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ energies were directly employed in the final fitting. Further, the present approach is free of the additional evaluation cost of the correction PES in the dynamic calculations, as the correction PES is only used to predict the energy difference between low-and high-level computations.It\'s crucial to sample configurations efficiently from the DFT dataset, as the computational cost is directly determined by the sampling size. In the HC scheme, the grid approach was used to sample points from the low-level dataset. This method is efficient for the tri-atom F + H2 system, but is unfeasible for larger systems due to the exponential growth of the number of data points with the system size. Bowman and co-workers used root mean square (RMS) bond difference between two configurations as the criterion to select points near the equilibrium of stationary points and chose a random integer that indicated their position on a list of the remaining points to select points in other regions, which produced a subset that spans the same range of configurations as the original DFT dataset. A small number of configurations were needed to reproduce the key properties around the equilibrium of the stationary points or along the MEP. However, this sampling method is prohibitively expensive for the title reaction with a large configuration space and it\'s desirable to sample points efficiently to make the correction PES ΔVHL-LL converged with fewer high-level energies.It\'s well known that the NN-based potentials are represented by nonlinear ""non-physical"" functions and have limited extrapolation capabilities. Therefore, in principle, if some regions were not covered well, namely, lacking points, different NN potentials would have large uncertainty for configurations of these regions. Based on this fact,', ""of the NN potentials, we can efficiently select points from the lowlevel dataset. To test the effectiveness of this approach, we construct the first accurate fulldimensional ground triplet state PES for the HO2 + HO2 → H2O2 + O2 reaction. Finally, only about 14% (10700) of the DFT data points (75300) are used to accurately bring the DFT PES of this system to UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ level. This newly fitted PIP-NN based Δ-machine learning approach will be used to build PESs of larger systems in our future work. Note, other NN approaches can be also used to replace PIP-NN to train the correction PES.Based on the newly fitted PES, the QCT calculations are carried out to study the dynamics of the title reaction. We find a special mode-specificity dynamics, namely, exciting the spectator HO stretch mode of HOO' can significantly enhance the reactivity of the title reaction at low collision energy, which was first reported in our previous work of the OH + HO2 → H2O + O2 reaction. Unlike the conventional mode specificity, this special mechanism can be attributed to increased attraction potential caused by the excited OH. As pointed out earlier by us, such special mode specificity effect may be prevalent in combustion and atmospheric reactions. More interesting dynamics will be expected in various complicated reactions once their full-dimensional accurate PESs are developed, for instance, by the present efficient approach.PIP-NN based Δ-ML method. For the PES of the title system, the first step is to construct a low-level DFT PES at the selected UM06-2X/AVTZ level. Developing PESs of reactive systems has been detailed in our previous work, and thus is not repeated here. Overall, the PES was gradually improved until all relevant dynamical results were converged and key properties, including geometries,"", 'have shown that for the title reaction, CCSD(T) method may easily run into convergence issues or predict a wrong-state energy, particularly for regions of multireference nature, as found also in another important reaction in combustion and atmosphere, OH + HO2 → H2O + O2. The newly proposed Δ-machine learning approach is efficient to obtain high-level energies for a large number of points.Indeed, the newly proposed approach is, to some extent, similar to the composite approach proposed and developed by Pople and other pioneering theorists. The chemical accuracy can be efficiently reached at the computationally cost of combinations of these models. Briefly, the target high-level energy can be obtained by adding various corrections, which were crafted to determine efficiently,1 2 1 HL LL IL LL IL IL HL IL i E E E E E - - - = + \uf044 + \uf044 + + \uf044(2)with LL for low level, ILi for the intermediate level i, and HL for target high level. Given an appropriate low-level calculation, the problem then becomes how to determine accurate and efficient estimation for ΔEs. Consequently, one can determine the energies for a large number of configurations efficiently within the hierarchy scheme. Further, one can improve previous PESs by adding more and more corrections gradually, which is invaluable for the science community of developing PESs and related fields.However, how to efficiently sample points from the low-level dataset is a key issue, as the computational cost is directly determined by the sampling size. Therefore, we propose in this work an NN-based Δ-machine learning approach for developing full-dimensional accurate PES. Taking advantage of the uncertainty of the NN potentials, we can efficiently select points from the lowlevel dataset. To test', 'The potential energy surface (PES) plays a central role in chemistry. As the size of the reaction system increases, it would be more and more difficult to develop its globally accurate full-dimensional PES. One unavoidable difficulty is that it is too expensive to calculate electronic energies of ample configurations for complicated reactions. Δ-machine learning, or the hierarchical construction scheme is a highly cost-effective method as only a small number of highlevel ab initio energies are required to improve a potential energy surface (PES) fit to a large number of low-level points. Based on this idea, we propose a permutation-invariant-polynomial neural-network (PIP-NN)-based Δ-machine learning approach to construct full-dimensional accurate PESs of complicated reactions efficiently. Particularly, the high flexibility of the NN is exploited to efficiently sample points from the low-level dataset, which is very useful for the large 2 systems with large configuration space. The approach is applied to the HO2 + HO2 → H2O2 + O2 reaction, a key process in combustion and atmosphere. The full-dimensional triplet state PES is first constructed with a large number of density functional theory (DFT) points, which cover all dynamically relevant regions. Only 14% of the DFT dataset are used to successfully bring the DFT PES to the UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ quality. On this PES of high quality, quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations are performed to study the dynamics of the title reaction. A surprising modespecific dynamics is observed, in which exciting a spectator mode leads to significant enhancement of the reactivity at low collision energy. This special mechanism can be attributed to increased attraction potential caused by the excited spectator mode. Such mode specificity may be quite prevalent in free radical reactions involving HO2, which is common in combustion and atmosphere.']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Unclassified']",672,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9197293223490366,0.0,['what']

These results suggested that product inhibition is important as the rate of dissociation of the template:product strongly influences the success of the self-replication. Yet the overall stability of the intermediate complex also plays a significant role, which had until now been overlooked. In addition, simulations were conducted with 5 x kcat and 0.2 kcat to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the rate of ligation. When the kcat is 5 times faster than the value determined from our best fit of the data, the self-replication was much faster than what we observed. Conversely, the ligation rate was much slower when kcat was reduced by a factor of (0.2 x kcat), resulting in slow amplification of the templates (Figure ). These simulations are consistent with previous work that showed a strong dependence of replication on the magnitude of kcat of ligation. These simulations reveal two important take-home messages for developers of nonenzymatic self-replicating systems: they should focus on ways to stabilize the intermediate complex as well as ways to destabilize the product duplex and select rapid ligation strategies. Regarding the latter, very little product was observed within the first 7200 seconds (2 hours) of reaction when kcat was reduced to 0.1kcat (simulation not shown).Next, to provide some insight as to how the presence of the abasic affected the interactions with the enzyme, we determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat and Km for the ligation reaction in Cycle I for the system with and without the abasic group.

Yet incorporating random sequential steps into the model (ie.binding of first of either IIaP or IIb to DNA-I) and simulating the results using the same values of k+1/k-1 resulted in a very similar kinetic profile (Figure ). Additionally, we assumed the same forward and reverse rate constants (k+1 and k-1, respectively) for the formation of the Ia:IIaP and IbP:IIb that give rise to the background reaction. We also constrained the background reaction between the primer duplexes Ia:IIaP and IbP:IIb to form DNA-I:IIaP:IIb to have a rate constant value of 0 in our kinetic model based on the results from our ligation experiments (Figure ). From the global fit, the rate constant for the ligation steps from the kinetic model (kcat) for nicked duplexes that contain an abasic group was 0.3 ± 0.1 s -1 , which is of similar magnitude to the reported kcat for the ligation of DNA strands without an abasic group using T4 DNA ligase (0.57 ± 0.11 s -1 ). 50 ', ""revealed surprisingly that the enzyme compensates for the stability gaps between the intermediate complex and product duplex primarily by raising the stability of the nicked duplex, thereby helping to overcome product inhibition.

This difference in magnitude of 10 2 in the enzyme binding affinity can help explain how the KA, prod/KA, inter ratio in the absence of the enzyme shrank from 10 3 -10 4 to 10 2 in the presence of the enzyme. The KA from the kinetic model contains contributions from both the intrinsic binding affinity of the DNA and the binding affinity of the enzyme for the complexes, so both of these effective Kprod and Kinter values are expected to increase in the presence of the enzyme. The change in Kinter is consistent with a higher binding constant for the intermediate complex in the presence of enzyme. Although the effective Kprod (with enzyme) is slightly lower than the K of the product duplex from ITC, we believe that this <4-fold difference is not significant, and that the stability of the product duplex is essentially unaffected by the presence or absence of ligase. ).

Simulations were performed wherein the hybridization rate constants were systematically increased or decreased by factors of 10 from the values determined from the best fit. This resulted in increases or decreases in the intermediate or product duplex KA values by one order of magnitude (Figure ). For the intermediate complexes, Figure shows the change in the hybridization rate constant (k+1) while Figure describes the changes in the dissociation rate constant (k-1). When the stability of the intermediate complex was one order of magnitude higher by increasing k+1 by a factor of 10 the formation of DNA-I and DNA-II was much faster (short, dashed line, Figure ). However, when the stability of the intermediate complex was reduced by one order of magnitude (0.1 x k+1), self-replication was not observed (long dashed line, Figure ). Similar results were observed when the affinity constant was changed by varying the k-1 values (Figure ). In contrast, when the product duplex affinity was changed by increasing or decreasing product hybridization rate (k+2) by 10-fold, the self-replication of DNA-I and DNA-II were only slightly affected (Figure ). In contrast, when the k-2 value was changed, it resulted in a much bigger impact on the cross-catalysis. As k-2 was increased to 10 x k-2, the dissociation of both DNA-I and DNA-II was much faster while when k-2 was reduced to 0.1 x k-2, there was no self-replication observed (Figure <ref type=""figure""', ""ConclusionIn conclusion, it has been shown that the addition of an abasic group at the ligation site instead of thymidine decreases the product duplex affinity constants for a particular 18mer duplex from 10 12 M -1 to 10 8 M -1 and the intermediate complex from 10 4 -10 5 M -1 to 10 3 -10 4 M -1 at 30 °C, the optimal replication temperature for this sequence. However, in the presence of an enzyme, the stability gap between the abasic-containing product and intermediate complexes is reduced from 10 4 -10 5 to 10 2 . We attribute this surprising difference to the stronger affinity of the enzyme for the intermediate rather than product complexes. This finding explains how we observe very fast selfreplication with LIDA despite the expected product inhibition. Indeed, our kinetic model reveals how rapid self-replication can be achieved even when the affinity constants are higher for the product duplex and the intermediate complex; a fast enough kcat is required together with a high enough affinity constant for the intermediate complex. Altogether, both the abasic group at the ligation site (which preferentially destabilizes the product duplex) and T4 DNA ligase (which preferentially stabilizes the intermediate) play significant roles in achieving rapid isothermal DNA self-replication. Therefore, a successful oligonucleotide self-replication system should incorporate product destabilization and a catalyst that favors the intermediate complex to further overcome product inhibition. These results can guide efforts to generate autonomous self-replicating oligonucleotides that use chemical rather than enzymatic ligation.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.

858,"SIGNIFICANCENecroptosis is a well-characterized form of caspase-independent regulated cell death that is involved in numerous diseases. A hallmark of necroptosis is the membrane permeabilization and rupture that is mediated by mixed linage kinase like protein (MLKL). This membrane rupture is linked to the inflammatory properties of necroptosis and is critical for disease states involving this process. It is established that electrostatic interactions between phosphatidyl inositol phosphates and phosphorylated MLKL (pMLKL) oligomers facilitate the membrane recruitment of pMLKL. In efforts to understand how lipids might contribute to necroptosis, we previously showed that saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulate and that they are functionally involved in this process. Our results also indicated that protein fatty acylation by VLCFAs can be a mechanism by which VLCFAs contribute to this process. Here we define the scope of protein acylation by saturated VLCFAs during necroptosis. First we show that, although there is an overall decrease in acylation, some proteins, including MLKL and pMLKL, are exclusively acylated during necroptosis. Reducing the levels of VLCFAs decreases the membrane recruitment of MLKL and pMLKL and rescues from cell death, suggesting that acylation by VLCFAs contributes to membrane localization of pMLKL and subsequent membrane permeabilization. Acylation of MLKL and pMLKL occur downstream of phosphorylation and oligomerization and appear to be S-linked. Second, we show that disruption of clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway results in a strong rescue in cell viability during necroptosis, likely by removal of pMLKL from the plasma membrane. Altogether, we show for the first time that MLKL and pMLKL can be acylated during necroptosis. We also show that disruption of endocytosis presents a promising strategy to delay membrane permeabilization and cell death during necroptosis",Causal,How do VLCFAs contribute to the process of necroptosis?,"VLCFAs contribute to necroptosis by acylating proteins such as MLKL and pMLKL.

However, we believe that modifications by C16 FA and VLCFAs contribute to membrane permeabilization differently during necroptosis. We previously showed that VLCFAs interact with membranes and disrupt their integrity in model liposomes and molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the modest increases of VLCFAs during necroptosis, we proposed that the incorporation of VLCFAs into proteins can facilitate their recruitment to defined membrane domains and allow high local concentrations of these lipids at the membrane and perturb membrane integrity . Translocation of pMLKL oligomers to the plasma membrane is driven by electrostatic interactions between the oligomer interface and negatively charged phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)-rich membrane domains. Several PIP species are known to be actively involved in cell signaling cascades, both in endogenous processes as well as in mechanisms of action of viruses and other pathogens. Protein-lipid interactions can alter lipid patterns on the membrane via electrostatic interactions or amino acid insertion into the bilayer. In turn, lateral lipid sorting alters the local mechanical and structural properties of the membrane. Binding of pMLKL oligomers to defined regions of the plasma membrane and further rearrangement of the local lipid distribution at their binding site', 'DISCUSSIONS/CONCLUSIONSThere are multiple signaling pathways that can be activated in response to TNF-α activation. This activation, in the presence of low caspase-8 activity and low activity of the of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis antagonists, results in the activation of necroptotic signaling, activation of RIPK3, and phosphorylation of MLKL in necroptosomes. A recent study illustrated that downstream to its phosphorylation, MLKL translocates to the plasma membrane via Golgi-, actin-and microtubule-dependent trafficking, a new rate-limiting factor in necroptosis. Upon binding to the plasma membrane, pMLKL oligomers induce membrane permeabilization which does not appear to occur via the formation of regularly-structured membrane pores . Based on these observations and others , it is likely that other transformations that pMLKL might undergo contribute to membrane permeabilization or the mechanism that stabilizes pMLKL oligmers at the plasma membrane.We have previously studied the involvement of lipids in necroptosis and showed that saturated VLCFAs were upregulated via activated biosynthesis and mediate membrane permeabilization. Our results suggested that these VLCFAs might be incorporated into proteins during necroptosis and targeted to certain membrane regions as a result of specific protein-bilayer interactions, allowing high local concentrations of these VLCFAs on the plasma membrane. In this work, we investigate the role of VLCFAcylation during necroptosis and present two key findings.First, we show that pMLKL and MLKL are acylated by a representative saturated', 'necroptosis. Overall, our results provide novel findings on the role of protein acylation by VLCFAs during necroptosis and endocytic trafficking in maintaining pMLKL at the plasma membrane during this process.', 'the plasma membrane and further rearrangement of the local lipid distribution at their binding site allows high concentration of fatty acids that covalently modify pMLKL. Acylation of pMLKL oligomers would allow the local recruitment of VLCFAs to membrane regions that already possess different mechanical and structural properties, which facilitates their membrane disruption action.Second, we define the scope of protein VLCFAcylation during necroptosis using state-ofthe-art quantitative proteomics methods. Overall, we observe a decreased number of proteins are modified by a representative VLCFA during necroptosis. Pathway analysis conducted using proteins that show different levels of VLCFAcylation during necroptosis highlighted the enrichment of proteins belonging to the endocytic and lysosomal pathways. Previous studies have shown that pMLKL can associate with ESCRT proteins and flotillins which is suggested to result in the removal of pMLKL containing regions from the plasma membrane and their degradation. In parallel, flotillin association of pMLKL can result in its removal from the plasma membrane via exosomes. Based on these observations, it is clear that vesicular trafficking is key for maintenance of pMLKL and MLKL at the plasma membrane. We show that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulted in a strong rescue from cell death during necroptosis and decreased the levels of membrane bound pMLKL, whereas the whole cellular MLKL levels remained unchanged, suggesting that the inhibition of endocytosis pathway enhances the removal of pMLKL from the plasma membrane and preserves plasma membrane integrity. These results suggest for the first time that targeting endocytosis could be a way to delay membrane permeability during necroptosis.

635,"IntroductionMetal ions, including transition ones, play a fundamental role in living organisms. Present in about 30% of the known genome, their impacts on molecular and cellular processes are countless. Since biometallic complementarities sustain many mechanisms in living systems, they are essential for their adaptation to the environment and key to their health. Understanding how metallic moieties interact with biological systems is not just a healthrelated question. It is also a source of inspiration for the development of new synthetic routes, including environmentally friendly ones. As such, chemists have long intended to mimic biometallic synergies for industrial purposes. In the form of small amenable chemical systems (biomimetics) or complex de novo enzymes, a substantial part of chemical efforts focuses on reproducing or even extending Nature's bioinorganic repertoire.The specific problem of predicting where and how metallic moieties bind to proteins is of crucial importance in numerous areas of chemistry and its closest interfaces. After decades, researchers in bioinorganics still intensively work on decoding the exact weight of the different molecular variables that are involved in the construction of biometallic edifices (charges of the metal ions and their amino acid environment versus electric field of the entire protein, redox properties of the metal, etc.). In silico approaches offer an excellent option to get a better insight into metal-protein interactions and help in establishing predictive patterns. To date, though, only a limited ensemble of computational tools is available. Those methods are either based on sequence or structural analyses.

In a subsequent study, we preselected docking areas by filtering the distance from the metal to the β-carbon of the amino acids Asp, His, Glu and Cys, using a range from 2.5 to 5.0 Å. Both works showed that few geometric descriptors related to the backbone of the protein afford with convenient information to predict metalbinding sites rather than focusing only on the first coordination sphere donors (mainly side chains) that coordinate the metal.BioMetAll represents a major step forward in how to predict metal-binding sites in proteins. The approach stands on the geometric information extracted from a collection of about 171000 biological complexes to infer a combination of geometric rules that are used to evaluate the regions of a protein for metal binding. The program accurately reproduces the experimental metal-binding motifs on a benchmark of 53 structures. Furthermore, we present three specific case studies to illustrate its potential. BioMetAll is efficient to i) predict metal-binding sites with particular amino acid motifs even for non-canonical metal coordinating amino acids and backbone atoms; ii) determine transient metal-binding sites in structures that need conformational changes to reach the complete coordination sphere, which could be related to metal diffusion pathways; and even iii) predict potential mutations of an existing protein to generate convenient metal-binding sites. This new approach can make a significant contribution to future development in fields like metalloenzyme and metallodrug design.', 'of the protein side chain for the metal to bind including transient geometries that require conformational changes or modification of the coordination environment (vacant sites, presence of labile ligands etc…) for the metal to bind.In recent years, our group has actively worked in areas where it was essential to predict with confidence those amino acids that could coordinate metal compounds either for proteins or peptides. In those works, we frequently confront with new-to-Nature metal-binding sites, X-ray structures of proteins without a well-defined binding site or even putative binding sites of metallodrugs. Part of our efforts allowed us to develop a series of docking approaches that can well reproduce low energy poses of metal-protein complexes. However, such approaches are only viable if good guesses for metal-binding regions are accessible on the first hand. For this aspect, in a first statistical analysis about ten years ago, we observed that i) any amino acid with its ⍺-carbon located within a sphere up to 7-9 Å could potentially be considered as a metal ligand (obviously considering possible coordination by residues with long side chains like lysine or tyrosine) and ii) the center of mass of the coordinating residues generally does not stand far from the exact position of the metal ions observed in the', 'to predict mutations that could be necessary to generate new metal-binding sites in a protein for example for building new biocatalysts.BioMetAll, and its ground on backbone preorganization, appears as a very interesting option in fields related to biometallic interactions. It is fundamental to highlight that BioMetAll does not energetic terms. Posterior refinements might be necessary depending on the object of the study. At the moment, we put a large amount of effort to bridge BioMetAll to other methods like those allowing extensive conformational sampling such as Molecular Dynamics and protein-ligand dockings. We believe that this kind of combination would open new horizons for research in chemistry and its interface with biology.3737', 'BioMetAll: Identifying Metal-Binding Sites in Proteins from Backbone Preorganization With a large amount of research dedicated to decoding how metallic species bind to protein, in silico methods are interesting allies for experimental procedures. To date, computational predictors mostly work by identifying the best possible sequence or structural match of the target protein with metal binding templates. These approaches are fundamentally focused on the first coordination sphere of the metal. Here, we present the BioMetAll predictor that is based on a different postulate: the formation of a potential metal-binding site is related to the geometric organization of the protein backbone. We first report the set of convenient geometric descriptors of the backbone needed for the algorithm and their parametrization from a statistical analysis. Then, the successful benchmark of BioMetAll on a set of more than 50 metal-binding X-Ray structures is presented. Because BioMetAll allows structural predictions regardless of the exact geometry of the side chains, it appears extremely valuable for systems which structures (either experimental or theoretical) are not optimal for metal binding sites. We report here its application on three different challenging cases i) the modulation of metal-binding sites during conformational transition in human serum albumin, ii) the identification of possible routes of metal migration in hemocyanins, and iii) the prediction of mutations to generate convenient metal-binding sites for de novo biocatalysts.

Some examples are MetalDetector, that identifies potential transition metals binding sites involving Cys and His side chains as donors; MetalPredator, that predicts potential Fe-S motifs in proteins; or ZincFinder, which is aimed at predicting zinc-binding motives. On the other, structure-based predictors mostly focus on identifying specific structural metal-binding motifs derived from databases of existing proteinbound to metal structures that match the best with the atomic organization of the target protein. Some of these approaches are metal-specific, like TEMPS and FETURE, that are dedicated to identifying Zinc binding motifs.

However, the identification of those sites in systems that do not display an optimal sequence or which structure does not present the sufficient amount of preorganization can be challenging. Such situations are frequent in modern inorganic biochemistry. For example, de novo design of metalloenzymes frequently require mutations of the protein to generate a convenient coordination center.

ISC in the literatureWith an upper bound of the ISC rate constant of TIPS-Pn and the bimolecular SF rate constant in solution, we can compare our findings to other observations of ISC and SF in the literature. (4) and ( ) with bimolecular SF rate constants that have been adjusted for the presence of ISC (fit).used. Substituting this ISC rate into the SF model described by Eqs. ( ) and ( ) leads to 17% T 1 production for a singlet lifetime of 18 ns and 13% T 1 for a lifetime of 13 ns (Table ). This amount of triplet formation was absent in their experimental data, so this ISC rate is unfeasibly fast. Note that the T 1 lifetime used does affect the predicted T 1 yield on a microsecond time scale, so we have used the 6.7 µs reported by Walker et al., which is already much shorter than other estimates (Table ). The T 1 lifetime would have to be as short as 100 ns to begin to approach undetectable T 1 levels. If we instead use the upper limit of the ISC rate constant found here, a triplet yield of less than 4.3% at 10 µs is predicted, which is more consistent with their experimental observations. Our findings are also consistent with the observations of Schaberle et al. who observed negligible triplets in 0.001 mM solutions in toluene or 0.39 mM solutions of chloroform, respectively. At these concentrations, the upper bound of the ISC rate constant, 3.08 × 10 6 s -1 , predicts triplet yields of 6.2% or less at 0.001 mM and 7.2% or less at 0.39 mM. Their data may show even less triplet formation than this (it is difficult to say without knowing the detection limit), but these values are consistent as upper bounds regardless.A series of papers by Grieco et al. also refer to ISC', 'T 1 lifetime may be much longer in a lowoxygen environment, but 9 µs is still substantially longer than the timescales here, so this value had no effect on the fit. Finally, the initial S 1 concentration, [S 1 ](0), and the bimolecular singlet fission rate constant, k SF , were fit to the S 1 and T 1 kinetic data, respectively. The fitted concentrations are shown in Fig. (a), where the shaded gray region represents the range of possible kinetics that fit the triplet concentration. These rate constants are summarized in Table . ) and ( ) for TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn. The S 1 lifetimes, τ S 1 , were determined from the rate constant of a single exponential fit to the 0.05 mM GSB TA kinetics, minus the ISC and SF rate constants. The T 1 lifetimes, τ T 1 were taken from literature. The ISC rate constant, k ISC , was either fixed to zero or determined as in Sec.

The bimolecular SF rate constant was fit as (2.7±0.6)×10 9 M -1 s -1 . At the concentration here this value corresponds to a pseudo-first-order rate constant of (2.2 ± 0.5) × 10 7 s -1 , or time constant of 48±10 ns. The lower bound of the SF rate constant corresponds to the fit to the lower bound of the triplet concentration, which comes from the upper bound of the triplet basis spectrum. Correspondingly, the upper bound of the SF rate constant comes from the upper bound of the triplet basis', 'IV. CONCLUSIONSUsing transient absorption spectroscopy of 0.05 mM and 8 mM solutions of TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn in toluene, we have quantified an upper bound on the rate constant (lower bound on the time constant) of intersystem crossing (ISC) in these solutions as 3.08 × 10 6 s -1 (325 ns) and 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 (118 ns), respectively. Taking the ISC rate constants into account, we were also able to quantify the bimolecular singlet fission (SF) rate constants in these solutions as (2.6 ± 0.7) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 for TIPS-Pn, and (2.3 ± 0.9) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 for TIPS-Tn, where the range of values comes from the uncertainty in the ISC rate constant and in the T 1 basis spectra. We have pointed out some discrepancies in the literature, and shown that ISC can be overestimated by disregarding diffusion-limited SF in dilute solutions. Alternatively, SF can also be overestimated by not appropriately considering T 1 contributions from ISC. For systems in which SF is relatively slow, or is limited by diffusion through solution or exciton diffusion through a disordered material, the effect of ISC is particularly important. To make progress in the implementation of SF in photovoltaic devices (or in fact in other applications, such as quantum computing), it is important to accurately identify and quantify SF rate constants and yields, which would be impossible in many circumstances if ISC is not also considered.FIG. 1 .1FIG. 1.

There is minimal shape change over time for 0.05 mM, but significant change for 8 mM due to SF.', 'the upper bound of the SF rate constant comes from the upper bound of the triplet basis spectrum. The full range of fitted values is summarized in Table of the supplementary material. Dvořák et al. fit the SF rate constant for a range of TIPS-Pn concentrations in chloroform, and found the rate constant decreased linearly with concentration below 10 mM. The bimolecular rate constant from this linear trend was 4 × 10 9 M -1 s -1 . This value is somewhat larger than the (2.7 ± 0.6) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 from our analysis here, which we attribute partly to the different rates of diffusion in chloroform and toluene. Toluene has a higher viscosity than chloroform (0.56 mPas compared with 0.52 mPas), so diffusion is expected to be slower. We can determine a theoretical rate of diffusion in these solvents from the Stokes-Einstein relation ask diffuse = 8RT 3η, where η is the viscosity. For toluene the diffusion rate is 1.2×10 10 M -1 s -1 , and for chloroform it is 1.3×10 10 M -1 s -1 . This difference (10%) is smaller than the difference in SF rate constants of TIPS-Pn in the two solvents, but the Stokes-Einstein relation is a simplified representation of diffusion, and the trend is consistent. We note the two solvents also have different dielectric constants (2.38 for toluene compared to 4.81 for chloroform). It has been suggested that charge-transfer states may play a role in SF, which would be influenced by the dielectric constant, and may also be a contributing factor to SF. We also note that Dvořák et al. confirmed that there was negligible aggregate formation below 28 mM for solutions of TIPS-Pn in chloroform. Given the solubility of TIPS-Pn in toluene is similar to chloroform, we', 'even at 20 mM, where the contribution to triplet formation is 3.5%. Dvořák et al. quantified the rate of SF in solution for TIPS-Pn concentrations ranging from 5-60 mM, but did not account for ISC. It is possible that for the lowest concentrations used, a portion the SF observed was actually due ISC, and the SF rates may be overestimated.ISC is potentially much faster for TIPS-Tn than TIPS-Pn, which can partly be explained by the smaller difference in energies between S 1 and T 1 . ISC may make a significant contribution to T 1 formation at higher concentrations, or faster rates of SF, than for TIPS-Pn. There are few studied in the literature about ISC in TIPS-Tn. For the very high concentrations of TIPS-Tn solutions studied previously (300 mM), the rate of SF (or excimer formation) would be sufficiently fast to far outcompete ISC. also reported the TA of a 0.51 mM solution of TIPS-Tn in chloroform. They set an upper limit of 6% triplet formation over 3 µs, which they attributed entirely to ISC. Using the rate constants found here, we predict a triplet yield of 12-13% over the singlet lifetime, of which ∼20% is in fact due to SF. More significantly, the higher rate constant of ISC can lead to the overestimation of SF rate constants or yields. In the case of the 8 mM solution studied here, including ISC shifted the SF rate constant from (2.6 ± 0.6) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 to (2.0±0.6)×10 9 M -1 s -1 , and the SF triplet yield from 18-28% to 13-23%.

36,"and the main difference is in the O=C••Xe angle. This further confirms that the structure is likely near convergence with respect to basis set size.We have investigated two additional basis set effects: counterpoise correction for the basis set superposition error, and the effect of diffuse functions. The former has no significant effect on the structure, as the difference in the monomer separation obtained from MP2+δ(T) and CP-MP2+δ(T) is only 0.001 Å. On the other hand, the aug-MP2+δ(T) structure obtained with cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z basis sets augmented by diffuse functions (see in Fig. ) is remarkably close to the experimental r(2) m structure, with a disagreement in the monomer separation of only 15 mÅ. While this is most certainly a step in the direction, the increased computational cost compared to cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z calculations is immense: the augmentation of the basis set increases the number of basis functions by 20%, and the amount of memory required for the computation of the connected triples (ie. the (T) component) more than doubles. Notably, additive terms obtained from the differences of augmented and unaugmented 3-ζ calculations that are used in various extrapolation recipes do not perform well for non-covalent complexes. Therefore CCSD(T) computations with augmented 4-ζ basis sets might be unavoidable.Unfortunately, the currently available set of ""aug-cc-pwCVnZ""-quality basis sets is limited to the first two periods in the main group and first row transition metals, and appropriate density fitting basis sets are also unavailable.When the effect of correlating all core electrons is added to the MP2+δ(T) potential surface ( ), the minimum in the potential moves even further away from the r m structure is a case of obtaining a correct answer for the wrong reasons.",Explanatory,What is only 0.001 Å in the context of the effects on the structure?,The difference in the monomer separation,Easy,"['The former has no significant effect on the structure, as the difference in the monomer separation obtained from MP2+δ(T) and CP-MP2+δ(T) is only 0.001 Å.']","[[303, 1049]]","['density-fitted variant in the MP2+δ(T) recipe. The TZP-DKH and TZP basis sets are the 3-ζ quality basis sets from Campos and Jorge 34 designed for use with and without the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian. Finally, to estimate the effects of diffuse functions on the structure, the aug-cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z basis sets for O, C and S are paired with the cc-pwcV[TQ5]Z-PP basis set for Xe, augmented by diffuse functions from the aug-cc-pV[TQ5]Z-PP basis sets. The results of this calculation are denoted as aug-MP2+δ(T). All r 0 , r SE e , and r ([1,2]) m', 'in OCS, the remaining structural parameters (O=C=S angle, C=S bond length and the Xe-dependent parameters) remain within the uncertainty of the fits and the degree of fit decreases slightly. Both r m structures also show a bend in the OCS monomer of ∼1 • . From this data alone it is impossible to judge whether the distortion of the OCS monomer is an artefact of the fit.The most striking difference between the r m ), and theoretical (rMP2+δ(T) e) structure of Xe• • •OCS. m structures is shifted slightly towards the S atom.A comparison with the equilibrium structure obtained using MP2+δ(T) reveals that the chosen level of wavefunction theory predicts a significantly shorter monomer separation compared to the mass dependent as well as the semi-experimental structures (by 43 mÅ and 73 mÅ, respectively). The O=C••Xe angle from MP2+δ(T) is almost identical with the r SE e structure. The OCS monomer in the r SE e structure is only slightly distorted from the equilibrium values, with a 0.2 • inward bend. This leads us to two conclusions: i) the OCS monomer remains at near-equilibrium values, and the significant deviations of the OCS moiety from its equilibrium shape in both r m structures can be attributed to the fitting process, and ii) an effect unaccounted for in the MP2+δ(T) method leads to a larger monomer separation in the experimental results.As 7 isotopologues of the Ne• • •OCS complex have been measured by Xu and Gerry, 6 it is possible to apply the above fitting process to that set of rotational constants. The resulting rm structure is compared to the r SE e structure with B2PLYP-based corrections and the r MP2+δ(T) e structure in Fig. .The issues with the r SE e structure are obvious at the first glance: the C••Ne distance is longer by ∼140 mÅ compared to the other two structures, and the angle is also significantly different.', 'Chasing experimental accuracy with wavefunction theoryThe MP2+δ(T) recipe contains a Hartree-Fock component calculated from a [3,4,5]-ζ extrapolation.The correlation energy is calculated from two components: a second-order Møller-Plesset component calculated in an extrapolated [4,5]-ζ basis, and a higher-order correlation correction obtained from a difference in CCSD(T) and MP2 energies in an extrapolated [3,4]-ζ basis.The Hartree-Fock component is likely to be converged to the complete basis set limit. The convergence of the correlation energy is not so certain, and can be improved in three ways: i) by calculating correlation at a higher level of theory, ii) by using a larger basis set or adding diffuse and/or midpoint functions, or iii) by correlating all electrons in the calculation. Higher level correlation in dispersiondominated complexes of similar interaction energies was studied by Řezač and Hobza: the CCSDT(Q) correction to a CCSD(T) energy accounts for only 1-3% of the interaction energy. Due to the enormous computational cost of CCSDT(Q) calculations, we currently cannot investigate higher order effects on this system. Basis set incompleteness at the CCSD(T)/ [3,4]-ζ level is about ∼50 mÅ in the very weakly bound Ar• • •Ar complex, and decreases to ∼5 mÅ for a more strongly bound complex, such as NH 3 • •HF. The effect of increasing basis set size in the δ(T) component of the MP2+δ(T) recipe is shown in Fig. , in the left panel. Note that the O=C••S angle in the r (2) m structure ( ) is adjusted here by assuming the OCS monomer is linear. With increasing basis set size ( ), the intermonomer distance hardly changes, and the main difference is in the O=C••Xe angle. This further confirms that the structure is likely', '( 2 )2m and r SE e results. This could be an incompatibility of the cc-pwcV[TQ]Z-PP basis sets used for the frozen-core components with the all-electron TZP basis set used to calculate the δ AE FC (as AE-CCSD(T)/TZP -FC-CCSD(T)/TZP). An all-electron 4-ζ CCSD(T) geometry optimisation is currently prohibitively expensive. On the right panel of Fig. 7 we illustrate the effect relativistic corrections have on the potential energy surface, as well as on the minimum structures. By adding 4-th order corrections using the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian to the MP2+δ(T) potential, we obtain a global minimum that is within 10 mÅ of the r (2) m structure. The O=C••Xe angle is also essentially the same when a linear OCS is assumed in the r (2) m structure. However, it is worth noting that the relativistic effects are double counted in the right panel of Fig. 7: both scalar as well as spin-orbit effects are incorporated into the Xe effective core potentials, 25 the addition of the Douglas-Kroll-Hess correction treats the scalar relativistic effects a second time. These results confirm relativistic effects play an important role in the stabilisation of the Xe• • •OCS complex, but the agreement of the MP2+δ(T)+δ 4 rel results with the r', '. The calculated MP2+δ(T) binding energies D E are in a good agreement with the experimental values using the Lennard-Jones model for complexes up to Kr. This agreement breaks down with in heavier complexes likely due to relativistic effects. The minor disagreement in the interaction energies compared to previous CCSD(T) literature data can be explained by basis set incompleteness in the literature results. The deformation of the OCS monomer from its equilibrium structure upon complexation is predicted to be minimal, with the largest bend of 0.3 • predicted for Hg• • •OCS. The mass-dependent r (2) m structures of the Xe and Ne complexes differ significantly from the r SE e structures. The bond lengths and angles in the OCS monomer are distorted in the r ([1,2]) m fits, especially the position of the O-atom. However, with the OCS monomer constrained to its equilibrium geometry, the mass-dependent structures are likely the most accurate structures ever obtained for the two complexes. The 43 mÅ difference in the monomer separation in the MP2+δ(T) and r (2) m structures can be partially explained by the lack of diffuse functions in the cc-pwcVnZ basis sets: upon augmentation the difference drops to 15 mÅ. The closest agreement with the r (2) m structure could be obtained by adding the 4-th order relativistic correction (+δ 4 rel ) to the MP2+δ(T) results, highlighting the importance of relativistic effects. However, this procedure cannot be generally recommended, as the scalar relativistic effects are double-counted. The inclusion of diffuse functions into at least 4-ζ basis sets is a more systematic way of converging towards experimental structures.']","['Spectroscopy', 'Optical spectroscopy']",48,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9877201500817974,0.0,['what']

Haber-Bosch facilities are currently built in locations that have access to natural gas and are close to chemical industrial centers. The cost of ammonia production today is heavily influenced by the scale of production and the price of natural gas (Figure ). Smaller production scales result in higher production costs due to limited economies of scale, equipment costs, and labor costs that do not decrease proportionately with the scale. Ideally, Haber-Bosch facilities operate on production scales in the range of thousands of metric tons per day, enabling them to achieve production costs as low as 250 USD/t N H 3 when natural gas prices are low (∼ 2 USD/MMBtu). However, as production scales decrease (∼ 50 tpd), the production cost can increase by more than five times to 1,300 USD/t N H 3 . Moreover, even at large production scales, the production cost of ammonia is highly sensitive to natural gas prices. In early 2022, natural gas prices went from around 2 USD/MMBtu to over 40 Given the centralized nature of the Haber-Bosch process, there are fewer than a hundred production facilities worldwide. These facilities are predominantly located in rich countries that have access to inexpensive natural gas and advanced chemical infrastructure.

Here, we introduce both equilibrium and nonequilibrium versions of a state-specific solvation correction for vertical transition energies computed using RAS-SF wave functions, based on the framework of a polarizable continuum model (PCM). Ground-state polarization is described using the solvent's static dielectric constant and in the nonequilibrium solvation approach that polarization is modified upon vertical excitation using the solvent's optical dielectric constant. Benchmark calculations are reported for well-studied models of photo-induced charge transfer including naphthalene dimer, C2H4 • • • C2F4, pentacene dimer, and perylene diimide (PDI) dimer, several of which are important in organic photovoltaic applications. For the PDI dimer, we demonstrate that the charge-transfer character of the excited states is enhanced in the presence of a low-dielectric medium (static dielectric constant ε 0 = 3) as compared to a gas-phase calculation (ε 0 = 1). This stabilizes mechanistic traps for singlet fission and helps to explain experimental singlet fission rates. We also examine the effects of nonequilibrium solvation on charge-separated states in an intramolecular singlet fission chromophore, where we demonstrate that the energetic ordering of the states changes as a function of solvent polarity. The RAS-SF + PCM methodology that is reported here provides a framework to study charge-separated states in solution and in photovoltaic materials."", ""A recently-developed variant of RAS-SF allows analysis of charge-transfer (CT) states, which were previously inaccessible to the theory.

The position of CT states in the excitation manifold is often sensitive to polarization effects, even in low-dielectric environments such as organic photovoltaic materials. Therefore some treatment of the surrounding medium is likely necessary in order to make contact with experiments.In the present work, we augment the RAS-SF methodology to include solvent polarization based on dielectric continuum theory, within the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Specifically, we introduce both equilibrium (state-relaxed) and nonequilibrium versions of the RAS-SF + PCM formalism, in order to account for differential polarization upon electronic excitation of the solute.

This difference between the higher acoustic activity observed with the cathode relative to the anode, particularly at current densities above 200-300 mA cm -2 is more clearly observed by studying the cumulative energy of the acoustic hits (Figure (b)). Thus far, the focus has been on the number of hits recorded, which gives a good indication of the acoustic activity but does not include all information. By looking at the cumulative energy, this not only takes into account the total number of hits but other factors associated with each hit such as the duration and frequency of each hit.

Thus, the calculated fluorescence for the diffusive slab thickness is the sum of the fluorescence calculated for each slice into which 2𝐿 is divided. The hydroxide ion concentration of each slice is calculated from the simulation of Fick's Law and the fluorescence is then determined from the fluorescence vs [𝑂𝐻 -] equation (Eq. 23) that applies to the specific pixel distance (𝑟) along the radial line. However, as noted earlier, the calculated value from Eq. 23 needs to be adjusted to account for the different path lengths of 𝛥𝑦, 2𝐿 and 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 .The simulation moves forward at a time step (𝛥𝑡) that was typically about 1/10 th of the time between pixels (𝛥𝑡 𝑟 ). The time between pixels in the mixed sheet is the distance between each pixel (or pixel size) divided by the constant velocity in the mixed sheet. The fluorescence equation only changes with each advancement to the next pixel (𝛥𝑡 𝑟 ). Therefore, the calculation of the hydroxyl ion concentration profiles in 2𝐿 is accomplished about ten times as often as the fluorescence equation changes. To synchronize 𝛥𝑡 with 𝛥𝑡 𝑟 , a rounding up technique was used.For 𝛥𝑡 𝑟 = 10𝛥𝑡, the first five advancements of 𝛥𝑡 used the 4PL equation that applied to pixel 𝑟 0 . Advancements 6 through 15 used the 4PL equation which applied to pixel 𝑟 1 ; 16 through 25 used the 4PL equation for pixel 𝑟 2 , and so on. Although the 4PL equation is the same for approximately 10 consecutive increments of the simulation time, the concentration profiles changed for each increment in 𝛥𝑡 and therefore the fluorescence value for each slice also changed.Since the fluorescence intensity is a function of path length at a"", 'along the radial line at a distance 𝑟 from the impingement zone. Therefore, a comparison of experimental results and simulation results requires that the simulation calculate the fluorescence for the mixed sheet (MS) and not just the slab thickness along the radial line. The simulated mixed sheet fluorescence at pixel 𝑟 (𝐹𝐼 𝑀𝑆,𝑟 ) along the radial line was calculated as:𝐹𝐼 𝑀𝑆,𝑟 = 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 2𝐿 𝐹𝐼 2𝐿,𝑟(27)Whether calculating 𝐹𝐼 𝑗,𝑟 , 𝐹𝐼 2𝐿,𝑟 , or 𝐹𝐼 𝑀𝑆,𝑟 the values are determined by ratioing the path lengths or depths of the slice (𝛥𝑦), diffusive slab (2𝐿) or mixed sheet (𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 ). The initial reference is the fluorescence (𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 ) from a mixed sheet at a distance 𝑟 and at a constant [𝑂𝐻 -] equal to the [𝑂𝐻 -] of interest. This fluorescence is calculated from the fluorescence intensity vs [𝑂𝐻 -] equation (Eq. 23). This approach is consistent with the observation that fluorescence (and absorption) is proportional to the depth through which the light passes (Eq. 21).Substituting in for 𝐹𝐼 2𝐿,𝑟 yields the following:𝐹𝐼 𝑀𝑆,𝑟 = 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 2𝐿 𝛥𝑦 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 ∑ (𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 ) 200 𝑗=1 = 𝛥𝑦 2𝐿 ∑ (𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 ) 200 𝑗=1(28)Calculated values for 𝐹𝐼 𝑀𝑆,𝑟 and experimental values of the acid-base mixed sheet fluorescence as a function of time (or alternatively, pixel distance from the impingement zone) are then plotted and compared.', 'sheet.

Whereas the quantum mechanical picture (proton sharing) should dominate at low temperatures, our 50 K-and 300 K simulation results, along with the deuterated form simulation, strongly suggest that molecule-to-surface proton shuttling (classical mechanical picture) should be the prevailing mechanism at room conditions. These finding might help to shed further light on the behavior and reactive processes involving carboxylic species on TiO 2 surfaces. Moreover, this kind of strong HBs is crucial in several catalytic processes: for instance, short HBs with low barriers are considered essential in enhancing catalytic rates in enzymatic reactions (see, e.g. Refs. ). Strong HBs have been observed also at the surface of some inorganic materials and polymers upon interaction of surface (super)acid protons with adsorbed base molecules. The reactive surface.

The spectra of monodentate HCOOH feature the stretching modes signals involving the CH group at about 2900-3000 cm -1 , and the bands associated with the O-C-O group at 1680 cm -1 and 1290 cm -1 . But, interestingly, the calculated IR pattern does not have any signal at wavenumbers > 3500 cm -1 , typical of the OH stretching mode. To understand this result, we inspect the 300 K trajectories, where HCOOH basically keeps the monodentate adsorption geometry, with one carboxylic oxygen steadily bonded to a penta-coordinated surface Ti (Figure ).Nonetheless, the other carboxylic oxygen -initially protonated, forming an OH moiety hydrogen bonded to a surface oxygen atom -is, on average, only transiently protonated at 300 K, as the acid proton shuttles between the carboxylic oxygen (Figure ) and a surface oxygen (Figure ). The spectroscopic signature of this regime is a very broad and low-intensity band in the 2500-1800 cm -1 region (Fig. ). Such low-energy bands are peculiar of very strong hydrogen bonds X..H..Y in molecular systems characterized by short X-Y distances, and are reported to occur for proton sharing moieties in condensed phases as well. <ref type=""bibr""', 'Investigation of quantum effectsSo far we have discussed the thermal behavior of HCOOH on TiO 2 anatase in a purely classical mechanics frame, which highlighted a double well potential leading to a proton-shuttling mechanism. Actually it is well known that formic acid protons -and more in general proton transfer events -can be strongly influenced by quantum effects, in particular by zero point energies (zpe). To gather insight on such issue, we have optimized the structure of the activated complex at the PBE level (see SI for details).The harmonic frequency involving the ""shared"" proton resulted 1676 cm -1 (with an O s -O f distance of 2.395 Å), not surprisingly much lower than the wavenumbers obtained for the double well potential protonshuttling mechanism. By adding to the energy of the three optimized configurations the zpe, the barrier disappears, (see Figure ) indicating that the quantum approach predicts a shared-proton in a single-well at 0 K. Yet the energy differences still remain below the 1 kcal/mol, even upon inclusion of the zpe contribution. This result indicates that, in order to have a clear-cut answer to the question as to whether the molecule-to-surface proton transfer is governed by a single-well or a double-well potential, one should rest on electronic-structure calculations assuring at least 0.1 kcal/mol accuracy. Such a level of accuracy not only is beyond current DFT approximations, but, due to the size of the system, it is also not', 'Free energy profilesAs the molecule-surface proton-shuttling could be relevant for the overall reactivity of HCOOH on anatase, we calculated the free energy path for this process at 50 K and 300 K (Figure , including also data at 0 K, see below). In both cases we found two free energy minima, corresponding to the dissociated (Figure ) and nondissociated (Figure ) forms. In Figure , the same profiles are reported in units of kT as well. It emerges that at room temperature the shuttling barrier is of the order of kT, hence the shuttling process should be thermally accessible. Indeed, temperature does affect quantitatively the free energy profile: while at 50 K we obtain a free energy barrier of 0.84 kcal/mol, at 300 K the barrier is 1.17 kcal/mol. However, in terms of kT, the barrier amounts to 2.0 kT at 300K while it raises to 8.5 kT at 50 K: hence, overall the shuttling process would be favored upon increasing the temperature. Also, temperature copes to reduce the thermodynamic stability difference between the dissociated and undissociated forms (which is 6.4 kT at 50 K and 0.9 kT at 300 K).Starting from relevant configurations of the 50 K free energy profile, we calculated energy minima (at 0 K) by geometry optimizations at different levels of theory. At the PBE level we found modest energy differences between the two structures, with a preference for the undissociated HCOOH by 0.67 kcal/mol and a (0 K) barrier of 0.75 kcal/mol. We checked also for the effect of dispersion interactions by augmenting the PBE functional with the Grimme D2 correction , in this case the undissociated form is more stable by 0.48 kcal/mol and the shuttling barrier amounts', 'not only is beyond current DFT approximations, but, due to the size of the system, it is also not affordable via state-of-the-art wavefunction-based approaches.Nonetheless, although the single vs double-well issue still remains open, we gathered useful chemical insight on this system. A first remark is that the harmonic frequency associated to the optimized structure of the quantum mechanical minimum (1676 cm -1 ) falls in the region of strong hydrogen bonds -i.e., below the CH stretching modes and very close to the highest O-C-O mode of adsorbed HCOOH, as found for the ""classic"" proton shuttling at room-temperature (Figure ). Such a piece of information may help experimentalists in identifying shared or shuttling protons from the presence of low-wavenumber (and presumably very broad and weak) ν(OH) signals in vibrational spectra of adsorbed carboxylic acids. This model might explain also the reported STM acid proton ""invisibility"", as the carboxylate group conceals the proton from the tip. Secondly, earlier studies on nuclear quantum effects in molecular systems showed that, while quantum fluctuations and zero point motion dominate at very low temperature, the thermally activated (""classical"") behavior should prevail at room temperature. To explore this hypothesis, we simulated, at room temperature conditions, the adsorption of a species less sensitive than HCOOH to quantum delocalization effects : deuterated formic acid (DCOOD). Indeed, the 300 K simulation with deuterated formic acid revealed that even the acid deuteron shuttles between a TiO 2 surface oxygen (O s )and the carboxylic oxygen O f (See SI, Figure ).

While strictly speaking not equivalent, this is often approximated with the DFT orbital energy difference between HOMO and LUMO. We were able to obtain direct information about the electronic gap of the two molecules by UPS (Figure ) and NEXAFS (Figure ), which probe the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively.The peaks observed in the UV photoelectron (UP) spectra (Figure ) can be discussed in correspondence to Kohn-Sham orbital energies obtained by gas-phase DFT calculations.

We also performed periodic calculations of the molecular crystals to prove this point for our systems. The results of these calculations are shown in Figure of the supporting information (SI).Experimentally, the first electron removal energy, which we can associate with the highest occupied state of azupyrene, is situated at a binding energy of 2.10 eV, which is by 0.35 eV higher in energy for pyrene (2.45 eV).

This is apparent in the intense yellow color displayed by solutions of azupyrene, whereas solutions of pyrene are colorless (See insets in Figure ). In agreement with the yellow color of azupyrene, the UV/Vis spectrum (Figure ) shows an absorption peak for azupyrene at a photon energy of 2.6 eV, in the blue part of the visible range. Pyrene has its lowest energy peak at a much higher photon energy of 3.7 eV, well outside the visible range. The resulting optical excitation energies, determined from the rising edge of the peak, are 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding a difference of 1.09 eV. Our ab initio calculations within the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) approach (see vertical lines in Figure ) overestimate the absolute excitation energies for both molecules. However, the calculations yield a difference in transition energies of 1.10 eV between azupyrene and pyrene, in excellent agreement with the experiment. It should be noted that while the lowest energy excitation corresponds to the transition from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO→LUMO) in pyrene, this transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and the peak in the visible range has to be attributed to the transition into a higher lying unoccupied orbital (HOMO→LUMO+1). The calculated data for the UPS and NEXAFS spectra was rigidly shifted to match the experimental energy scale. The calculated NEXAFS transitions have already been published in context of method development.

The HOMO→LUMO dipole transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and therefore the LUMO energy does not control the optical band gap. (It should be noted that the HOMO→LUMO transition might still be responsible for a very weak signal at about 1.8 eV as shown in Figure in the SI, which is neglected for the following calculations.) For pyrene, the HOMO→LUMO transition is allowed and determines the optical band gap. If the difference between the optical band gap and the electronic band gap is to be calculated in a meaningful manner using electronic ""frozen orbital"" transition energies, the LUMO has to be excluded for azupyrene. Accordingly, the DFT-calculated electronic band gap of azupyrene increases from 2.96 eV to 3.62 eV. With this value the difference between the DFT-based ""frozen orbital"" electronic band gap and the (experimental) optical band gap is 1.08 eV (= 3.62 eV -2.54 eV) for azupyrene, while the same difference is only 0.20 eV (= 3.83 eV -3.63 eV) for pyrene. The large deviation between the electronic and optical band gap for azupyrene is a direct consequence of its nonalternant \uf070-electron system. This topological property of azupyrene leads to a localization of the molecular orbitals. When an electron is excited into a higher lying orbital, then its initial and final orbitals can be located in different parts of the molecule, thus decreasing electron-electron repulsion in the excited state and lowering the transition energy.

The first \uf070* resonance of pyrene has two maxima, which are caused by the C1s→LUMO and C1s→LUMO+1 excitations, as was ascertained by MO-projected NEXAFS simulations (see Figure in the SI and Ref. ). For azupyrene, the individual excitations in the first peak are not resolved, because the corresponding LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals are too close in energy. For both molecules, the MO-projected NEXAFS simulations show that the leading edge of the adsorption peak is determined by the C1s→LUMO excitation.The X-ray absorption edge of azupyrene appears at a lower photon energy by 0.37 eV than that of pyrene, as can be seen in Figure . Since the core-level energies differ only marginally, it can therefore be concluded that the LUMO of azupyrene is lower in energy. Theory also predicts the LUMO of azupyrene to be lower in energy, here the magnitude is 0.60 eV.Combination of the experimental differences of electron addition and removal energies from UPS and NEXAFS data indicate that the electronic band gap is 0.72 eV (= 0.37 eV + 0.35 eV) smaller for azupyrene than for pyrene. For comparison, the calculations yield a value of 0.87 eV for the difference in electronic band gap, which is in good agreement with the experimental finding. In addition, the calculations can provide the absolute electronic band gaps, which are not accessible by the experimental techniques at our disposal. The calculated absolute electronic band gaps are 2.96 eV and 3.83 eV for azupyrene and pyrene, respectively.

Furthermore, we discuss the results of NMR and IR spectroscopy together with an analysis according to the HOMA approach.The theoretical methods were always employed on the gas-phase molecules to have the same reference for experiments performed on thin films and on solutions of the molecules. The gas phase calculations additionally offer a more accessible interpretation using the molecular electronic states. However, we performed additional calculations for the molecular crystals with periodic boundary conditions to gauge the influence of intermolecular interactions, which are present in the experiments involving thin films, on the electronic properties.Our study reveals and illustrates the striking influence of the \uf070-electron system's topology on the electronic properties. The nonalternant molecule shows significantly lower electronic and optical band gaps and we found strong indications for lower electron-hole binding energies, which can facilitate electron-hole separation. Applying these results in the form of topological design to the development of new materials for organic electronic devices can open up a new pathway for tuning their properties in a systematic manner.

CONCLUSIONSWe have formulated, implemented, and tested a statespecific approach to solvation for RAS-SF wave functions. Both equilibrium (self-consistent and fully relaxed) and nonequilibrium (vertical excitation) versions are reported, the latter within a perturbative ""ptSS"" approximation introduced in earlier work. This new methodology opens the possibility to describe dielectric continuum effects on CT states within a cost-effective and easy-to-use wave function model for strong correlation, which can describe multi-exciton states and other types of excitations that are beyond the reach of (or poorly described by) single-excitation methods such as CIS and TD-DFT. Benchmark tests indicate good agreement with other methods for well-separated CT excitations (ion-pair states), in systems such as C 2 H 4 • • • C 2 F 4 and (naphthalene) 2 . The ptSS approach to vertical excitation energies agrees with literature results for stabilization of CT states versus LE states, in a model of a covalently-linked pentacene dimer that undergoes intramolecular singlet fission.Calculations on (PDI) 2 in two different geometries provide a rationale to understand the very different singlet fission rates that have previously been calculated for these systems. These calculations suggest that dielectric stabilization creates excitonic trap states in one geometry but not the other, by breaking symmetry and localizing charge. This observation has potentially important implications for the design of materials with good singlet fission rates, as the excitation spectra of model chromophores can now be easily tested as a function of solvent polarity. It also suggests that gas-phase calculations, even with highly correlated wave function models, may not offer a realistic description of singlet fission in solution, where polarization-induced charge', 'C. Perturbative state-specific solvationWe next describe a nonequilibrium approach to statespecific solvation that is appropriate for modeling vertical excitation energies. The nonequilibrium formalism recognizes that nuclear (vibrational and orientational) degrees of freedom within the (implicit) solvent do not respond quickly enough to remain in equilibrium with a vertical electronic transition, and indeed this is the sense in which the excitation is ""vertical"". There is also an electronic component to the solvent\'s polarization response, however, and it ought to remain in equilibrium with the solute. The total polarization in the ground state is thus partitioned into ""slow"" (nuclear) and ""fast"" (electronic) components,R0 = Rs 0 + Rf 0 .(11)Operationally this means that the ground-state polarization charge σ 0 (generated by R0 ) is partitioned as σ 0 = σ s 0 + σ f 0 , where 16σ s 0 = ε 0 -ε ∞ ε 0 -1 σ 0 (12a) σ f 0 = ε ∞ -1 ε 0 -1 σ 0 .(12b)The solvent\'s optical dielectric constant (ε ∞ ), which has been called the ""dielectric constant for induced polarization"", is used to describe electronic polarization.Considering the equilibrium expression for E k in Eq.

As noted elsewhere, the partition between inertial and noninertial solvent response need not be done in this way, and the total solvation correction is essentially the same in Pekar\'s alternative partition scheme, but is apportioned differently into zeroth-order and cor-rective terms. For the LE2 state, we also observe a reduction in the excitation energy as solvent polarity increases, but the effect is smaller as compared to the LCT1 state because LE2 does not involve significant charge separation.We next compare RAS-SF + ptSS-PCM results to the corresponding calculation at the CIS level, which will illustrate the ease of reaching target states with the RAS-SF procedure.

This information is contained within the Hessian matrix, some (or all) of which must be known to step towards a saddle point. Optimization to a first order saddle point requires stepping uphill on the potential energy surface in the direction of the reaction coordinate and downhill in all other directions. We define the reaction coordinate as the direction in which the curvature is smallest (most negative or least positive), which is by construction the leftmost eigenvector of the Hessian matrix. Therefore it is at least necessary to know this eigenvector to step towards a first order saddle point.For molecular saddle point optimization, it is common to evaluate the full Hessian matrix at least once at the beginning of optimization. Many electronic structure theory methods such as Hartree-Fock and DFT have efficient analytical Hessian implementations. Additionally, transformation of Cartesian Hessians into internal coordinates is straightforward. When using a level of theory for which efficient analytical second derivatives are not available, the Hessian matrix is usually evaluated in full using finite difference. For computationally expensive levels of theory or for very large molecules, the evaluation of the initial Hessian matrix may become more costly than all subsequent geometry optimization steps. Even when using levels of theory with efficient analytical second derivatives, evaluation of the Hessian matrix will eventually dominate the overall cost of optimization as system sizes grow larger due to the higher computational scaling of Hessian evaluations relative to gradient evaluations. For this reason, saddle point optimization methods which do not require full', 'gradient evaluations. For this reason, saddle point optimization methods which do not require full evaluation of the Hessian matrix may be useful for expensive levels of theory and for large systems.We have previously developed a saddle point optimization algorithm that efficiently identifies the leftmost eigenvector of the Hessian matrix using iterative diagonalization. Furthermore, this algorithm uses the information obtained by the iterative diagonalization procedure to construct an approximate Hessian that is exact in the subspace searched by the eigensolver. Our method can be compared to that of Sharada, Bell, and Head-Gordon, with the key difference being that all curvature information obtained by the eigensolver is incorporated into the approximate Hessian, not just the lowest curvature mode. This results in a much more accurate approximate Hessian matrix, and therefore a substantially more efficient optimization algorithm. However, as our method was originally designed only for optimization in a Cartesian coordinate basis, it was not suitable for optimization of molecular saddle point geometries. In this work, we extend our iterative diagonalization and approximate Hessian construction methods to optimization in a basis of redundant internal coordinates, potentially with added constraints. Our new method diagonalizes the Hessian and constructs the approximate Hessian directly in an internal coordinate basis. This is in contrast to the method of Sharada et al., which diagonalizes the Hessian and constructs the approximate Hessian in a Cartesian basis before transforming it into an internal coordinate basis.Our optimization algorithm enforces constraints using the SQP formalism, which is based on the method of Lagrange multipliers.

The goal of the iterative diagonalization procedure for saddle point optimization, outlined in algorithm 1, is to find the leftmost eigenvector of the Hessian of the potential energy H. For constrained optimization, the goal is instead to find the leftmost eigenvector of the Hessian of the Lagrangian H L , as this is the Hessian (or approximation thereof) that is used in the optimization procedure (see section 2.4). When performing an optimization in an internal coordinate basis, our algorithm iteratively diagonalizes the Hessian in the nonredundant internal coordinate basis q. One could alternately perform iterative diagonalization of the Hessian in the unconstrained nonredundant space q.

4,"on intermediate complexes based on the effects on the thermal dissociation (melting) temperatures (Table ). However, a rigorous thermodynamic analysis was not performed. To quantify the change in stability in terms of ΔH and ΔS, the DNA hybridization of the product and intermediate complexes was followed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which is widely used to measure the thermodynamic parameters of molecular interactions based on the isotherm obtained during titration with one of the complementary molecules or strands. Thermodynamic parameters were measured from the ITC analysis of various DNA complexes at approximately 5 °C lower than the complex's melting temperature to obtain the ΔH, ΔS and K that are associated with the formation (hybridization) of product duplexes and intermediate complexes (Table ). Thermodynamic parameters showed that the product duplex with thymidine exhibited much stronger binding affinities at 30 °C than that with the abasic group (1.98 x 10 12 M -1 vs 1.03 x 10 8 M -1 , respectively). This result was also supported by van 't Hoff plots based on the melting temperatures, which revealed the same degree of magnitude decrease in K (10 12 M -1 vs 10 8 M -1 , Table ). In contrast the binding affinities of the intermediate complexes with and without the abasic group were the same or of similar magnitude (Table ); for example, the K values of DNA-I:IIaP(T) and DNA-I:IIaP(D) were the same within error (4 ± 3 x 10 4 and 6 ± 3 x 10 4 , respectively).

These results confirmed that an abasic group in the DNA system lowered the stability of the product duplex considerably with a much lesser effect on the stabilities of the intermediate complexes. With respect to understanding the implications for turnover, the relevant comparison is the magnitude difference in K for the product versus the intermediate complexes for the system with and without the abasic group. The thermodynamic parameters revealed that the presence of the abasic group reduced the stability gaps between the association constants of the product duplex and intermediate complexes by 4-5 orders of magnitude (K of product and intermediate with abasic: 10 8 M -1 and 10 3 -10 4 M -1 , respectively, versus K of product and intermediate with complementary thymidine: 10 12 M -1 and 10 4 -10 5 M -1 , respectively). Yet the magnitude difference in association constants of the product and intermediate complexes for the system with the abasic was still substantial (3-5 orders of magnitude).To evaluate the same thermodynamic parameters under DNA self-replication conditions, we utilized a simplified kinetic model of our cross-catalytic system (reaction steps are shown in Table ). Using this model to fit our kinetic traces, we can determine the apparent hybridization K values exhibited during LIDA based on the ratio of the forward and reverse rate constants obtained from the fit. These apparent binding constants can then be compared with our previous thermodynamic analysis. To  Using the chemical reactions shown in Table , all four traces in Figure were fit simultaneously using KinTek Explorer to obtain the kinetic parameters of our self-replication system. To minimize the number of fit parameters, we assumed that the formation of the ternary complexes for both cycles occurred in two steps, each step with the same forward and reverse rate', 'Table 2.

The background reaction induced by pseudo-blunt end ligation of Ia:IIaP and IbP:IIb to form Ia:IbP:DNA-II yielded a bimolecular rate constant value of 1 M -1 s -1 , which was approximately an order of magnitude less than what we measured at 8 °C and 12 °C (2.7 ± 0.7 x 10 M -1 s -1 at 8 °C and 5 ± 2 x 10 M -1 s -1 at 12 °C). We attribute this difference in kbi from our ligation experiments at lower temperatures and the kinetic model of LIDA at 30 °C to our simplifying assumptions of the binding affinities of the fragment duplexes as well as the temperaturedependence of the enzyme binding to these fragment duplexes.The ratio of the rate constants k+1/k-1 from the kinetic fit yielded an association constant for the intermediate complexes DNA-I・IIap and DNA-II・IbP of 2.0 ± 0.3 x 10 5 M -1 . This affinity constant value is one to two orders of magnitude greater than the values from the ITC analysis for the intermediate complexes (10 3 -10 4 M -1 ). In contrast, the affinity constant determined for the product duplex from the kinetic model was 3 ± 1 x 10 7 M -1 , which is much closer to that determined from the ITC analysis (K = 1.03 ± 0.09 x 10 8 M -1 ). The change in affinity constants observed for the intermediate and product duplexes in the presence of the enzyme (from the kinetic model) and the corresponding values from ITC in the absence of the enzyme revealed surprisingly that the enzyme compensates for the stability gaps between the intermediate', '(0.07 s -1 ).We next explored the sensitivity of our model to the relative affinities of the intermediate and product duplex as well as to the individual binding constants associated with intermediate or product hybridization. Simulations were performed wherein the hybridization rate constants were systematically increased or decreased by factors of 10 from the values determined from the best fit. This resulted in increases or decreases in the intermediate or product duplex KA values by one order of magnitude (Figure ). For the intermediate complexes, Figure shows the change in the hybridization rate constant (k+1) while Figure describes the changes in the dissociation rate constant (k-1). When the stability of the intermediate complex was one order of magnitude higher by increasing k+1 by a factor of 10 the formation of DNA-I and DNA-II was much faster (short, dashed line, Figure ). However, when the stability of the intermediate complex was reduced by one order of magnitude (0.1 x k+1), self-replication was not observed (long dashed line, Figure ). Similar results were observed when the affinity constant was changed by varying the k-1 values (Figure ). In contrast, when the product duplex affinity was changed by increasing or decreasing product hybridization rate (k+2) by 10-fold, the self-replication of DNA-I and DNA-II were only slightly affected (Figure ). In contrast, when the k-2 value was changed, it resulted in a much bigger impact on the cross-catalysis. As k-2 was increased to 10 x k-2, the dissociation of both DNA-I and DNA-II was much faster while when k-2 was reduced to 0.1 x k-2, there was no self-replication observed (Figure <ref type=""figure""', ""ConclusionIn conclusion, it has been shown that the addition of an abasic group at the ligation site instead of thymidine decreases the product duplex affinity constants for a particular 18mer duplex from 10 12 M -1 to 10 8 M -1 and the intermediate complex from 10 4 -10 5 M -1 to 10 3 -10 4 M -1 at 30 °C, the optimal replication temperature for this sequence. However, in the presence of an enzyme, the stability gap between the abasic-containing product and intermediate complexes is reduced from 10 4 -10 5 to 10 2 . We attribute this surprising difference to the stronger affinity of the enzyme for the intermediate rather than product complexes. This finding explains how we observe very fast selfreplication with LIDA despite the expected product inhibition. Indeed, our kinetic model reveals how rapid self-replication can be achieved even when the affinity constants are higher for the product duplex and the intermediate complex; a fast enough kcat is required together with a high enough affinity constant for the intermediate complex. Altogether, both the abasic group at the ligation site (which preferentially destabilizes the product duplex) and T4 DNA ligase (which preferentially stabilizes the intermediate) play significant roles in achieving rapid isothermal DNA self-replication. Therefore, a successful oligonucleotide self-replication system should incorporate product destabilization and a catalyst that favors the intermediate complex to further overcome product inhibition. These results can guide efforts to generate autonomous self-replicating oligonucleotides that use chemical rather than enzymatic ligation.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.

The batch reactor was utilized as the experimental setup for conducting photocatalytic reactions, with UVA lamps serving as the source of illumination. The experimental setup included a magnetic stirrer and an ice-cooled condenser integrated into the reactor. A solution comprising of UiO-66-NDC (300 mg/L) and dye molecules (10, 15, 20 mg/L) in 100 mL of distilled water was formulated and subsequently introduced into the reactor. The suspension underwent a 30-minute stirring process under dark conditions to attain adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the dye molecules and UiO-66-NDC. Subsequently, the reactor was exposed to a UVA light source for a predetermined duration of 120 minutes, while being subjected to constant stirring. The process of dye molecule removal was observed through the utilization of UV-Vis absorption spectra measurements of the solutions at predetermined time intervals. Formula (1) was utilized to determine the percentage of dye removal.Color Removal % = [(C0 -Ct) / C0] x 100(1)The symbols C0 and Ct represent the initial and final concentration values of the dye, respectively.The rates of color removal were ultimately subjected to fitting with a pseudo-first order kinetic model, accompanied by their corresponding correlation coefficients (R 2 ).

Fig. illustrates the influence of catalyst dosage (UiO-66-NDC) on the photodegradation mechanism of dyes. The present study involved conducting empirical analyses of catalytic degradation at varying levels of catalyst quantities. The research employed the subsequent experimental conditions: The experimental parameters of the study comprised of a dye concentration of 15 mg/L, a pH level of 5.2, and a temperature of 25°C. The findings suggest that there is a favorable correlation between the amount of catalyst utilized and the degree of degradation, up to a certain threshold. However, exceeding this threshold level, a higher amount of catalyst results in a decrease in the efficiency of wastewater decolorization. The concentration of catalyst that yielded the best results was determined to be 300 mg/L. During the initial stages of the inquiry, it was observed that the rate of elimination exhibited a direct correlation with an increase in the concentration of the catalyst.After a reaction period of 90 minutes, the elimination rates remained consistent at approximately 70% for all catalyst concentrations, except for the RO16 and MO dyes at a concentration of 200 mg/L.

Several factors, including the molecular weight, dye structure, and unique characteristics of UiO-66-NDC, can impact the efficacy of dye removal. Optimal results were achieved with a catalyst concentration of 300 mg/L, as higher dosages led to reduced efficiency due to particle agglomeration and decreased light access to active sites.Higher initial dye concentrations also resulted in reduced removal rates due to increased competition for reactive radicals. The study highlighted the importance of understanding initial dye concentration for wastewater treatment. The study assessed UiO-66-NDC's reusability, showing a gradual decline in catalytic efficiency with each cycle due to active site depletion.Despite this, it demonstrated environmental sustainability and economic feasibility for water remediation, with some limitations in long-term reuse.

Since the surge in interest by US-based car manufacturers to develop hydrogen cars in the 1990's, hydrogen has ever since been promoted as a substitute for gasoline and diesel (and to a lesser extent, for liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, and liquefied natural gas, LNG). As is the case for industrial end-users looking for a substitute to fossil-fuel combustion, hydrogen could be used in an internal combustion engine (ICE), although the vehicle would probably need to be adjusted to fze the hydrogen consumption. The other main applications for extracting energy from hydrogen are proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, considered mainly due to their higher efficiency (~50%) with respect to ICEs (~30%); the operation of PEM fuel cells has already been extensively covered in the literature. There are several kinds of mobility applications including LDVs (light-duty vehicles i.e., passenger cars), MDVs (medium-duty vehicles e.g., vans, public transport buses), and HDVs (heavy-duty vehicles like long-haul trucks and coaches).Regarding LDVs, fuel cell vehicles have existed in the market for longer than a decade, with Japanese and Korean car manufacturers being the most prominent in the market. The main challenge with respect to LDVs is the availability of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs), although the current support for hydrogen-based mobility has accelerated the HRS market, from 330 stations available in 2017 to 540 in 2020.

These crucial actions are indispensable in addressing the climate change challenges. By embracing decarbonization strategies and adopting sustainable practices, we can alleviate the detrimental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and protect the well-being of the planet and future generations.Paris agreement in 2015 introduced the ""national low-carbon strategy"" and has emerged as a vital instrument. This ambitious roadmap not only serves as a guiding light but also forms the bedrock for our collective endeavor to foster a low-carbon economy. The strategy framework delineates a path that advocates for the adoption of energy-efficient and the utilization of renewable energy sources.Hydrogen (H2) is expected to play a significant and central role in our future society, particularly within the current efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy. The main reasons why H2 is becoming such an important commodity are:• H2 is a clean energy source, producing no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when used in fuel cells to produce electricity. This makes it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. • H2 is a versatile energy carrier that can be used in a variety of applications, from fuel cells for transportation to power/heat/electricity generation and industrial processes, e.g., fertilizers. • H2 can be used as an energy storage medium, allowing excess energy from intermittent renewable sources such as solar and wind to be stored efficiently and used when needed. • The development of a H2 infrastructure which encompasses production, storage, and transportation, would create new jobs and economic opportunities in the energy sector. • The use of H2 in transportation and other applications can support the efforts reducing GHG emissions, thereby mitigating the impact of climate change.As', 'ConclusionsIn order to attain the energy transition, value chain, techno-economic studies, and life cycle assessment are key tools to develop and implement synergistically evolving technologies, such as green hydrogen. Such technologies must be developed with productivity and stability as indicators. At the same time, development of hydrogen technologies should surpass their technical challenges to be able to provide reliable and competent prototype, ready and safe for the end-user. One of the major challenges is to lower the LCOH to 2$/kg to become competitive with fossil sources. Moreover, the performance of the present state-of-the-art green hydrogen production is below par behind the 10% efficiency requirements set by industry.

We decided to take advantage of the parallelization offered by 96-well plates to propose a Stern-Volmer plate design which involves increasing quencher concentration moving down a column, with a different quencher (or replicate) in each column (Figure ). Multichannel pipettors enabled the rapid dispensing of each component across the entire plate. To maintain a strict inert atmosphere around the samples, the entire sample preparation and measurement was performed under inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen filled glovebox in constant purge mode. This was made possible by the small footprint of the fluorescence plate reader, which can easily be introduced into a glovebox. To validate this design, we sought to test our approach by comparing Ksv values obtained with our workflow to values reported in the literature. We probed the quenching of (2,2'-Bipyridine)bis[2pyridinyl-N)phenyl-C]iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) by diethylbromomalonate, bromoacetonitrile and indole in dichloroethane (DCE) and observed similar trends in the quenching values, with diethylbromomalonate exhibiting a higher Ksv than bromoacetonitrile by a factor of 1.7 (in the original report, the factor is 2) and indole showing virtually no quenching (Figure ).  However, we measured higher quenching constants overall by a factor of ~2. This difference is likely because of our ability to consistently maintain the sample in an inert atmosphere throughout the entire measurement using this workflow.With this positive validation result in hand, we sought to showcase the magnitude of quenching data accessible through this high-throughput method. We decided to focus on generating Stern Volmer constants for a library of commonly used photocatalysts and quenchers in a rapid fashion.

On the contrary, photocatalysts such as Ru(phen)3Cl2 and Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2, one of the most important photocatalyst that launched the entire field of photoredox catalysis, exhibits fairly poor quenching with most substrates, which explains its decline in usage against more reactive Ir photocatalysts.In conclusion, we demonstrated the use of a highthroughput workflow for the measurements of Stern-Volmer quenching constants using commercially available fluorescence plate readers and 96-well plates. We validated the method by comparing the results to reported quenching values. Automatization of the liquid dispensing step allowed for the rapid preparation and analysis of the Stern-Volmer quenching for a collection of common photocatalysts and quenchers. We believe this workflow enables a consistent and rapid collection of quenching constants with readily available instrumentation, thereby finally bringing Stern-Volmer studies to the same level of high throughput capabilities as those for reaction discovery for photoredox catalysis. We believe this method, as well as the data generated is truly enabling for the community interested in mechanistic understanding of photoredox reactions.Experimental section: Chemicals and Materials: Unless stated otherwise, all the reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers (Acros, Merck Millipore Sigma, TCI America, Fisher Scientific, etc) and were of the highest analytical purity. UPLC grade solvents were used for all experiments. All operations we performed inside of a N2-filled glovebox. For the high throughput experiments, 96-well uv-star® microplates (part number 655809) were used. For the validation experiments, the microplate used was a 96-well quartz microplate (part', 'used. For the validation experiments, the microplate used was a 96-well quartz microplate (part number 730-009-44) due to solvent incompatibility. Emission measurements were performed with a Molecular Devices Spectramax M5 and the data was compiled on SoftMax Pro 6.5.1. Liquid handling was performed on a Tecan Freedom EVO 100 outfitted with an 8-channel liquid handler (LiHa) with Teflon-coated fixed tips.Microplate preparation: 20 mM stock solutions of individual quenchers and 10 \uf06dM stock solution of photocatalyst were prepared. The plate was designed such that one photocatalyst was dispensed across an entire plate and each column contained a different quencher. For example, 100 \uf06dL of photocatalyst solution was dispensed in all 96 wells. Then, in each in row, going from row A to H, 0, 10, 25, 40, 55, 70, 85 and 100 \uf06dL of quencher solution was added, with a different quencher in each column. Then, going from row A to H, 100, 90, 75, 60, 45, 30 ,15 ,0 \uf06dL of acetonitrile was added to make a total of 200 \uf06dL in each well. The microplate was sealed with a clear silicon mat and was placed in the microplate reader. The excitation wavelength was either taken from literature value for each photocatalyst or was determined experimentally from an absorption and fluorescence spectrum measured with the plate reader. The emission data was then exported to Excel and fit to the Stern-Volmer equation using least squares regression with y-intercept set to 1. The slope values (i.e. quenching constants) were filtered by magnitude and by R 2 value to constrain the data to observation of significant, linear quenching. Plots with noticeable but nonlinear quenching were tested for outliers (two standard deviations away from the line of best fit) and/or improved fit with the Lehrer equation.Figure 1 :1Figure 1: (A) General scheme for oxidative and reductive photocatalyst', 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b14"">[14] ; this can include questions such as establishing which reaction component is acting as the main quencher and the magnitude of quenching that occurs under catalytically relevant conditions. In some cases, quenching studies have resulted in revisions of the originally proposed mechanisms, while mechanistic understanding has led to designing improved photoefficiencies, faster reactions, and expanded scope. Emission quenching (also called Stern-Volmer) studies consist of measuring emission intensity fluctuations of the photocatalyst excited state in the presence of a quencher. In a typical Stern-Volmer study, a fluorometer is used to measure the emission intensity, and solutions of the photocatalyst with different concentrations of quenchers need to be prepared individually under a rigorously inert atmosphere to avoid the interference of oxygen quenching. Such constraints have limited the prevalence of Stern-Volmer studies compared to the extensive body of work on photoredox catalysis. A fully automated continuous flow platform has been developed to facilitate data collection and reduce manual labor, but remains low throughput and requires the construction of a homemade flow setup. In parallel, several high-throughput technologies such as LED-illuminated 96well plates as well as microfluidic and screening capabilities have been developed to allow for parallelized rapid discovery of new photoredox reactions. <ref', 'High Throughput Determination of Stern Volmer Quenching Constants for Common Photocatalysts and Quenchers Mechanistic information on reactions proceeding via photoredox catalysis has enabled rational optimizations of existing reactions and revealed new synthetic pathways. One essential step in any photoredox reaction is catalyst quenching via photoinduced electron transfer or energy transfer with either a substrate, additive, or co-catalyst. Identification of the correct quencher using Stern-Volmer studies is a necessary step mechanistic understanding; however, such studies are often cumbersome, low throughput and require specialized luminescence instruments. This report describes a high throughput method to rapidly acquire series of Stern-Volmer constants, employing readily available fluorescence plate readers and 96 well-plates.

To keep up with the exponentially increasing chemical space for photoredox transformations, new workflows that enable Stern-Volmer data collection at a higher throughput need to be developed.To that end, we have devised a protocol for the collection of Stern-Volmer quenching data using commercially available fluorescence plate readers and consumable 96-well plates. Plate readers are ubiquitous in biological studies and have been used in a variety of colorimetric and fluorometric assays, as they allow for rapid (<1 min) reading of an entire 96-well plate. In our quenching studies, the use of well-plates enables the collection of Stern-Volmer constants for one photocatalyst and up to 12 quenchers in less than a minute. We further expanded the throughput of this workflow by devising a protocol for a liquid handling robot to enable the automated dispensing of quenchers at increasing concentrations in a 96-well plate format. This allowed us to rapidly prepare multiple plates of 20 commonly used photocatalysts, and for each, measure the Stern-Volmer constants of 11 common quenchers.

The more rigid H4FBCDC linker does not even allow a small contraction of the network due to desorption stress and capillary forces before the coordination bond within the zinc paddlewheel breaks. For DUT-49(Zn) in comparison, the difference between the paddlewheel stability and the linker rigidity is exactly this much smaller a contraction can happen before the coordination bond breaks.This finding leads to the assumption that a linker with smaller rigidity than that of DUT-49 linker could lead to a network that shows a full contraction before amorphization while solvent evaporation.",Comparative,How does the stability of the zinc paddle wheel unit compare to that of the copper paddle wheel unit?,The stability of the zinc paddle wheel unit is lower than that of the copper paddle wheel unit.,Easy,['by the fine interplay of the lower stability of the zinc paddle wheel unit compared to the copper paddle wheel unit and the higher rigidity of the H4FBCDC linker (DUT-140) compared to the H4BBCDC linker (DUT-49).'],"[[0, 212]]","['CONCLUSIONIn brief, three new MOF materials DUT-140(M) (M = Cu, Co, Zn) were successfully synthesized. As predicted by mechanical considerations of the H4FBCDC ligand, the metal-organic framework DUT-140(Cu) shows intrinsic flexibility as well as negative gas adsorption property with an ΔnNGA = 5.45 mmol/g. The contraction of the opphase can be induced by adsorption of hydrocarbons like methane or butane as well as carbon dioxide. Adsorption experiments also confirm the assumption that the use of the H4FBCDC linker leads to a more rigid network since the adsorption of nitrogen does not trigger the phase transformation.UV/Vis investigations of DUT-140(Cu) showed a distinct change in the absorption spectrum which could be attributed to an excitation from the carbazole moiety to the fluorenone part by DFT calculations. Since this excitation is highly affected by the deformation of the linker, it can be concluded that the fluorescence spectrum also should change under the given conditions due to the structural transformation.The fluorescence properties of the fluorescent linker could be unveiled by an exchange of the metal node to a zinc paddlewheel. However, the stiffening of the metal-organic framework did not lead to the desired increased resistance to desolvation stress for DUT-140(Zn), indicating the metal node to be the main limiting factor, leading to amorphization during desolvation in such highly porous framework materials, even under mild supercritical conditions.In situ fluorescence studies provide clear evidence that a fluorescence change is caused by structural decomposition of the metal-organic framework and revealed the importance of the fine interplay of linker rigidity and metal node stability for the investigation of structural contraction by solvent desorption.Overall, fluorenone moieties are valuable functional building blocks for the detection of structural', 'Fluorescence in DUT-140(Cu)Photoluminescent properties of the H4FBCDClinker in solution and within the suspended metalorganic framework in the solid state were investigated at room temperature. According to the fluorescence spectra (Figure ), a 3 mM solution of H4FBCDC linker in NMP shows a yellow emission with maximum at 17,750 cm -1 (λExt. = 27,397 cm -1 ). However, no fluorescence of the solid linker powder can be observed. This fluorescence quenching in the solid state is most likely due to the efficient π-π-stacking of the linkers. In contrast, in the crystal of DUT-140 the MOPs are interconnected by the fluorenone containing backbones into a three-dimensional structure. As a result, the fluorenone moieties are isolated from other groups and therefore not involved in any weak interactions, which prevents fluorescence quenching as it is shown in figure of the supplementary information. However, d-d transitions in the d Cu 2+ ions still hinder a spectroscopic investigation of the linker in the network. As a result, no fluorescence can be detected after crystallization of the MOF, as this is suppressed due to the complex formation and quenching.Nevertheless, the UV/Vis spectra of the DUT-140(Cu) in the op and cp phases were recorded and compared with simulated UV/Vis spectra of the straight and bent ligand (Figure ). DUT-140(Cu) shows a strong absorption in the range of 15,000 cm -1 to 27,500 cm -1 . This absorption is divided by a small local minimum whereby the absorption band at higher wavenumbers can be attributed to the linkerabsorption and the absorption band at lower wavenumbers originates from the metal centers.The contraction of the DUT-140(Cu) from the op (blue line) to the cp (black line) phase causes a red shift of', ""stress for each linker is reached at approximately 0.014 compressive strain. The H4FBCDC ligand reaches the maximum yield stress at 1.30 nN, which is higher compared to the H4BBCDC that demonstrates an inelastic transition at 1.02 nN. Furthermore, the Young's modulus, reflected by the linear slope of the stress-strain curve, is also larger for H4FBCDC. The demonstrated strain resistance behavior shows that the intended linker is more rigid than the DUT-49 linker, which follows chemical intuition based on comparison of the chemical structures.These simulations also demonstrate the overall deflection for the H4BBCDC is larger than for H4FBCDC. The pore sizes of the related op-phases of corresponding MOFs do not differ significantly, as shown in the supplementary information section 3.3.7. The performance of an NGA material cannot be directly derived from the stress strain curve, however, the increased rigidity of H4FBCDC is expected to permit a overloading of the metastable state, increasing the NGA step. However, increased rigidity may also lead to a reduction of the ligand's deflection which in turn could lead to a hindered contraction. "", 'Experimental investigation of desolvated DUT-140(Cu)As the theoretical calculations of the mechanical properties of H4FBCDC predict the potential for NGA, the ligand was synthesized in a similar six step approach used for the synthesis of recently reported elongated versions of H4BBCDC. The carbazole was converted to dibutyl-9H-carbazole-dicarboxylate over four steps and the obtained dicarboxylate was used as starting material in an Ullman-coupling reaction with 2,7-dibromofluorenone. After the following hydrolysis and purification, the H4FBCDC ligand was obtained in 28% yield over six steps. All compounds have been analyzed by H-and C-NMR as well as by mass spectroscopy and IRspectroscopy as shown in supplementary information chapter 2.Combination of H4FBCDC with copper(II)nitrate in N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) yields the framework with a composition [Cu2(FBCDC)] (H2O)x(DMF)y, denoted as DUT-140(Cu).

The desorption branch shows no', ""In silico investigations of DUT-140The contraction/reopening mechanism responsible for NGA in DUT-49 is related to a deformation of the BBCDC linker, further denoted as ligand buckling. In previous work, a method was developed to allow an investigation of the mechanical properties of ligands, which directly reflect the switchability and the probability of NGA in frameworks isoreticular to DUT-49. This was achieved by calculating stress-strain curves for the single ligand using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Therefore, simulations were performed also for H4FBCDC ligand before synthetic efforts were made.The mechanical properties of the H4FBCDC were determined by simulated compression of the linker at the carbazole nitrogen's (orange arrows, Figure ) using the accurate tight-binding quantum chemical method, GFN2_xtb. From these calculations stress applied to the linker can be determined and the mechanical stability in addition to the response of network induced pressure can be explored as shown for H4BBCDC (blue) and H4FBCDC (orange) in Figure . Initially increasing the compressive strain to both linkers results in an elastic response up to a certain point, defining the maximal stress. After reaching this point, the linker itself starts to buckle (Figure ). This step in the stress strain curve is a common feature of all ligands, used for the synthesis of NGA materials. As derived from the graph in Figure the maximum stress for each linker is reached at approximately 0.014 compressive strain.

71,"Hydrogen in mobilityMobility has been the most discussed application of hydrogen in the past decades. Since the surge in interest by US-based car manufacturers to develop hydrogen cars in the 1990's, hydrogen has ever since been promoted as a substitute for gasoline and diesel (and to a lesser extent, for liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, and liquefied natural gas, LNG). As is the case for industrial end-users looking for a substitute to fossil-fuel combustion, hydrogen could be used in an internal combustion engine (ICE), although the vehicle would probably need to be adjusted to fze the hydrogen consumption. The other main applications for extracting energy from hydrogen are proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, considered mainly due to their higher efficiency (~50%) with respect to ICEs (~30%); the operation of PEM fuel cells has already been extensively covered in the literature. There are several kinds of mobility applications including LDVs (light-duty vehicles i.e., passenger cars), MDVs (medium-duty vehicles e.g., vans, public transport buses), and HDVs (heavy-duty vehicles like long-haul trucks and coaches).Regarding LDVs, fuel cell vehicles have existed in the market for longer than a decade, with Japanese and Korean car manufacturers being the most prominent in the market. The main challenge with respect to LDVs is the availability of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs), although the current support for hydrogen-based mobility has accelerated the HRS market, from 330 stations available in 2017 to 540 in 2020. Besides the infrastructure availability, the cost of the LDVs fuel cell and hydrogen as fuel are considered a challenge to be overcome by the development of both suitable transport and storage infrastructure.

Up to this day, the amount of hydrogen consumed outside of industrial facilities is significantly low (mainly used as a reagent in research laboratories, in some captive MDV fleets, and the few available HRS worldwide before 2010). In this context, the development of the (trans)national hydrogen transport networks anywhere has not been felt by stakeholders in the hydrogen sector.', 'Transport of hydrogen in the existing natural gas infrastructureThe most popular method of transporting hydrogen nowadays is via the use of tube trailers, which is merely a trailer that carries a bundle of tubes and supplies gases to a particular consumer. The main disadvantage of transporting hydrogen via tube trailers is the high cost of transported hydrogen: a single tube trailer can only carry approximately 400 kg of hydrogen, and the limitation lies in the weight of the steel tubes used as well as in the maximum allowable storage pressure in tube trailers (250 bar in the U.S.). One of the proposals that has recently gained significant attention in the hydrogen world is to repurpose the existing natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure. Transporting hydrogen in a network that has already been commissioned would bring significant advantages including 1) a short(er) time horizon for the development of a large-scale hydrogen transport infrastructure, 2) significantly lower capital expenditures (CAPEX) of the transport system for hydrogen, and 3) to bring freedom and certainty to stakeholders on both the consumption and production sides of hydrogen, so that they can develop projects where they deem it best suited to their interests.The retrofitting of the existing natural gas infrastructure to accommodate hydrogen comes with challenges of its own. As a first example, there could be competition with natural gas. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that natural gas will continue to play a role in the global energy mix, both in the lead up to 2050 and potentially beyond. This implies that hydrogen and natural gas could compete with one another for access to the transport infrastructure; in principle, this could be solved by physically blending hydrogen in the natural gas, albeit blending', 'Hydrogen shipping and hydrogen carriersHydrogen transportation is a crucial component in establishing a global hydrogen economy. While pipeline transport is practical for short distances, the transportation of hydrogen across oceans is necessary for long distances. The development of hydrogen shipping using various carriers, including compressed gas, liquefied hydrogen, and ammonia, presents an opportunity for countries to access clean energy sources that may not be available locally. However, several challenges need to be addressed, such as safety, cost-effectiveness, and competition with existing supply chains.This type of transportation is known as hydrogen shipping and can be accomplished using various hydrogen carriers (Table ).

In particular, three heavy industries, i.e. chemicals (production of primary chemicals i.e., ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, ammonia, and methanol), steel, and cement, account for nearly 60% of all energy consumption and about 72% of all the industrial CO2 emissions. Electrifying industry has been a viable option for years, but it has two challenges. Firstly, the cost of electricity per unit energy (MWh) is higher than fossil fuels, making it less appealing for businesses. Secondly, industrialized countries such as Germany, Poland, the US, and the Netherlands produce electricity with high carbon intensity (>300 g CO2/kWh) , making electrification ineffective in reducing industry's carbon footprint.In densely populated countries like the Netherlands, the electricity grid is near its maximum transport capacity, causing congestion problems. Large off-takers and electricity producers joining the network without a planned expansion worsen the situation. Hence, hydrogen is seen as a potential substitute for electrification. In industry, there are two primary methods for utilizing hydrogen. The first is to generate heat, primarily high-temperature heat. The second is to use it as a chemical reagent in processes such as the Haber-Bosch process for obtaining ammonia.If heat is the main input needed by a particular industry, then in principle hydrogen can directly substitute fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal.

For example, while an average LDV might drive ~20.000 km per year, a long-haul truck drives at least three times more (~60.000 km/year) and the overall number of driven with an HDV before decommissioning is significantly higher than for an LDV. The increased lifetime and operating hours of an HDV mean that the current generation of PEM fuel cells (that were perfected for LDVs as it was the primary driver for their development) cannot follow the more stringent requirements for HDVs (and some MDVs as well).

LCD is currently the most ubiquitous display due to its good image quality, reasonable price, and energy efficiency. However, scientists' insatiable appetite for game-changing technologies has led to the discovery and commercialization of LCD's only competitor -OLED technology.

Others have shown that various electrically driven or photochemically induced degradation products can attenuate the luminance and overall performance of the OLED devices by progressively decreasing electroluminescence quantum efficiency during the device operation. Chemical isomerization of certain OLED emitters is another unfavorable phenomenon found to occur during synthesis, vapor-deposition, and postmanufacture operation that may influence the lifetime of the device.

With high morphological and thermal stability, these compounds can enhance device performance by increasing lifetime and reliability; hence, they are of interest as OLED materials.

To that end, researchers are turning to organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) as the display materials due to higher energy saving and richer color compared to liquid crystal displays (LCDs). However, one major setback of the OLED technology is that the devices are very sensitive to the impurities present in the OLED materials, impacting device lifetime, stability, and overall performance. The isolation of large quantities of the main OLED components from the synthetic impurities is challenging using the traditional purification process (i.e., train sublimation), which has poor reproducibility, and high capital and operating cost. Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) could lend itself as an alternative technique for the profiling of impurities and their purification.

The HPLC separation of OLED compounds, especially in the case of structural homologs/analogs and geometric/optical isomers of OLEDs, often entails compromised resolution due to the lack of selectivity (tend to co-elute). Chromatographic method development for such structurally similar compounds and isomers is laborious and timeconsuming. Moreover, impurities or degradation products are often structurally very similar to the analytes; as a result, they elute on the front or tail of the main analyte peak or potentially remain hidden under the target chromatographic peak. In such a scenario, it becomes practically difficult for the analysts to detect and remove impurities from the main peak, especially in the preparative scale when the higher mass load becomes critical. In addition to the chromatographic resolution, HPLC analysis of OLEDs, in most cases, involves normal phase chromatography that utilizes 100% organic solvents as the mobile phase due to the low solubility of the most OLED compounds in the aqueous-based solvents. Utilization of such a high volume of organic solvent is hazardous from the environmental perspective and costly.Sivasubramaniam, et al. utilized three columns in series and used 100% acetonitrile as the mobile phase to separate a standard mixture of only four OLED compounds in about 50 minutes -this is an example of HPLC separation of OLEDs with a considerable waste of time and resources. Therefore, the utilization of preparative HPLC for the purification of OLEDs becomes a poor choice due to the requirement of excessive energy and high dry-down time to deal with such a high volume of organic solvent.

422,"Results and DiscussionA. Comparison to Experiment. By tuning the photon energy and thereby the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons, 63 liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to measure the concentration profile (versus depth) of ions at the air/water interface. In other measurements, the concentration dependence of the photoelectron yield of aqueous aniline was found to correlate with the surface concentration inferred from surface tension measurements. If the ionwater hydrogen bonds are different at the interface as compared to those in bulk water, then the VIE might provide a probe of these structural changes. Indeed, comparison of the valence photoelectron spectra of the liquid and vapor phases of water suggests that spectral shifts engendered by hydrogen bonding are different depending on the orbital that is ionized, and the convergence tests VIEs for aqueous anions computed from bulk (isotropic) and interfacial (slab) simulations, in comparison to experimental VIEs from Ref. 86.

Experimental errors are reported to be 0.1-0.3 eV for I -(aq) and smaller for the other ions. For calculations in bulk water, continuum boundary conditions can be implemented either by means of a PCM, which uses a sharp dielectric boundary located at the solvent-accessible surface, or else using a smooth dielectric interface centered around that surface, as in the PEqS approach. The variation between VIEs predicted by either approach is < 0.4 eV in all cases (Table ), which offers some indication of the uncertainty associated with construction of the dielectric boundary. Only the PEqS method is extensible to the air/water interface, and a key result of the present work is that difference between bulk and interfacial VIEs are < 0.1 eV, on average.

Here, we compute aqueous-phase VIEs for a set of inorganic anions, some of which partition preferentially at the air/water interface, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. The results are in excellent agreement with experiment, regardless of whether the simulation data are restricted to ions at the air/water interface or to those in bulk liquid water. Although the computed VIEs are sensitive to ion-water hydrogen bonding, we find that the short-range solvation structure is sufficiently similar in the bulk and interfacial environments that it proves impossible to discriminate between the two on the basis of the VIE, a conclusion that has important implications for the interpretation of liquid-phase photoelectron spectroscopy. More generally, analysis of the simulation data suggests that partitioning of soft anions at the air/water interface is largely a second (or third) solvation shell effect, arising from disruption of water-water hydrogen bonds and not from significant changes in first-shell anion-water hydrogen bonding.', 'solute may or may not be different than what it is bulk aqueous solution. Whereas liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy may be surface-sensitive, our results strongly suggest that the observable that it measures is not surface-sensitive.This work also reports a new computational protocol for aqueous VIEs. The existing conventional wisdom is that a prohibitively large number of explicit water molecules is needed to obtain converged VIEs in aqueous solution, but with an appropriate choice of continuum boundary conditions we find that convergence is achieved with two solvation shells. VIEs reported here are within 0.2-0.3 eV of experimental values, even for polyvalent anions. This is comparable to the accuracy of the best existing periodic DFT calculations of the same quantities, but without the complexities posed by the periodic treatment when the number of electrons changes. The protocol reported here is also readily extensible to wave function-based quantum chemistry.Rapid convergence of the VIE in our cluster-continuum protocol suggests that this quantity is mostly sensitive to short-range solvation structure, with the continuum boundary conditions making a large but non-specific contribution at longer range. Similarities in bulk and interfacial VIEs result from similarities in the short-range hydration environment. Our', ' and ultraviolet spectroscopy of small aqueous solutes have been demonstrated, there has been no systematic investigation of whether VIEs themselves are sensitive to the presence of the air/water interface; the only detailed studies concern the rather unique case of the hydrated electron. It is known that the VIE of liquid water is largely unaffected by dissolved ions, shifting by < 0.2 eV over an 8 M concentration range, and the VIE of I -(aq) is similarly unaffected by concentration. It is not yet known whether VIEs of aqueous ions are sensitive to the air/water interface or not.That issue is examined here by computing bulk and interfacial VIEs for 16 common inorganic ions for which experimental data (from liquid microjets) are available, using a combination of MD simulations and electronic structure calculations. Long-range polarization makes a significant contribution to VIEs in water, and we incorporate this effect via dielectric continuum boundary', 'in bulk and interfacial VIEs result from similarities in the short-range hydration environment. Our results are therefore consistent with the presumed surface-sensitivity of liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy, but also reveal that these values can likely be taken seriously as VIEs for bulk aqueous solutes. The latter are important parameters for the solution-phase theory of electron transfer. Observed similarities in the solvation structure of bulk versus interfacial anions sets up another interesting conundrum, namely, how to reconcile these observations with shifts in the O-H stretching band of water are detected (using surface-selective vibrational spectroscopy) when soft ions are present at the air/water interface. Our results suggest that this is likely a second-shell (or possibly third-shell) solvation effect, resulting from subtle changes in the network of waterwater hydrogen bonds that are induced by the presence of the ion, rather than resulting directly from changes in ion-water hydrogen bonds at the interface.

These valuable and reactive intermediates have been used in the synthesis of a diverse array of natural products and bioactive compounds.

First, a panel of nucleophiles was evaluated in 1,4additions to the in situ-generated o-QMs (Fig. , 18 and 19). Both linear and branched alcohols were competent nucleophiles, affording the desired products (73-75) in good yields. A secondary amine nucleophile was also well tolerated (77); however, reactions with several primary amines resulted in an undesired condensation reaction with the pendant aldehyde to form imines. Thiol nucleophiles reacted smoothly to provide the desired conjugate addition products (20 and 76) in excellent yields. The comparatively high yield of thioether adducts relative to alkyl ether adducts is likely due to the increased nucleophilicity of sulfur as well as stability of the sulfur adducts compared to the alcohol precursor. The feasibility of benzylic C-C bond formation was probed through inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reactions. The reactivity of biocatalyst-generated benzyl alcohol 17 with various dienophiles was evaluated through a one-pot reaction sequence. Following generation of 17 by CitB, the reaction mixture was heated to 45 °C in the presence of ethyl vinyl ether. Gratifyingly, chroman products 78 and 79 were produced in 64% and 27% yield, respectively. Reactions with electron-rich dienophiles (78-83) proceeded smoothly to deliver mixtures of two isomeric products derived from the two possible o-QM intermediates (18 and 19). Reactions employing electron-rich dienophiles typically afforded 4:1 mixtures of isomeric products, favoring the product derived from reaction with the C1 o-QM (19). Reactions with styrenes 84-89 were also carried out. Due to the electron-deficient character of these dienophiles, these reactions required a higher temperature, 65 °C, to undergo a productive reaction.

This was accomplished by establishing scalable biocatalytic reaction methods to provide an inexpensive and highly accessible platform for benzylic hydroxylation. Using this platform, we have leveraged NHI dioxygenasecatalyzed hydroxylation for further diversification of phenolic scaffolds. Chemoenzymatic formation of o-QM intermediates was followed by reactions with small-molecule and peptide nucleophiles as well as electron-rich dienophiles, leading to the synthesis of the fungal natural product (-)-xyloketal D. Thus, direct access to a diverse set of compounds though this simple chemoenzymatic cascade is possible. We anticipate that our method for biocatalyst-initiated o-QM generation can be broadly applied to other chemoenzymatic systems capable of performing benzylic C-H hydroxylation and will enable transformations complementary to small molecule catalysts and reagents.

Therefore, a one-pot method for the chemo-and site-selective generation and diversification of o-QMs would address key challenges in exploiting these useful synthetic intermediates in synthesis.Inspired by the efficiency of Nature's approach for the generation of o-QMs, we sought to exploit enzymatic mechanisms for o-QM creation. In these systems, the o-QM is proposed to arise from ortho-cresol precursors (see 7, 9, Fig. ) through hydroxylation of the benzylic position, followed by loss of water to directly form an o-QM under mild intracellular conditions. These intermediates are subsequently functionalized with bioavailable dienophiles or nucleophiles, generating the associated natural products, such as peniphenone D (11). We anticipated that a biocatalytic approach to oxidative o-QM generation could afford numerous advantages in the development of a selective and sustainable method (Fig. ).

However, this approach is generally restricted to electron-rich compounds and does not provide control over the site-selectivity of the benzylic oxidation.

123,"State-of-the-Art Ammonia Production: Capacity, Cost, LocationThe current Haber-Bosch process produces ammonia in a centralized manner. Haber-Bosch facilities are currently built in locations that have access to natural gas and are close to chemical industrial centers. The cost of ammonia production today is heavily influenced by the scale of production and the price of natural gas (Figure ). Smaller production scales result in higher production costs due to limited economies of scale, equipment costs, and labor costs that do not decrease proportionately with the scale. Ideally, Haber-Bosch facilities operate on production scales in the range of thousands of metric tons per day, enabling them to achieve production costs as low as 250 USD/t N H 3 when natural gas prices are low (∼ 2 USD/MMBtu). However, as production scales decrease (∼ 50 tpd), the production cost can increase by more than five times to 1,300 USD/t N H 3 . Moreover, even at large production scales, the production cost of ammonia is highly sensitive to natural gas prices.

However, approximately 175 million metric tons of ammonia are produced yearly in fewer than 100 locations around the world. This results in transportation distances of thousands of kilometers in some instances. A consequence of centralized fertilizer manufacturing is that transportation costs can contribute more than 30% of the total fertilizer cost in certain regions. The cost of ammonia-based urea can range from as low as 250 USD/t in the United States to as high as 1,060 USD/t in Mozambique. This cost divergence often contributes to the underuse of synthetic ammonia-based fertilizers in many regions with growing populations, raising concerns for equitable development.

Moreover, as shown in our earlier work, we have also observed a background-triggered process where exponential amplification occurred without the presence of an initial template (DNA-I) (open circles, Figure ). This process is attributed to a pseudo-blunt end ligation of the four fragments in the absence of any DNA-I templates. This ligation is not a true blunt end ligation, performed facilely by T4 DNA ligase, as the duplex that results from hybridization of Ia and IIaP has a 5'-phosphate abasic nucleotide, which should not interact with the 5'-phosphate deoxyadenosine single-base overhang from the IbP:Iib fragment duplex, hence our use of the term pseudo-blunt end. We have observed that T4 DNA ligase triggers this background process in all of the sequences that we have successfully amplified by LIDA suggesting that the enzyme is also effective at ligating either at or across from abasic single-nucleotide overhangs. First, we focused on identifying the kinetics of this background ligation reaction to allow us to more accurately incorporate the background triggered process into our kinetic model. The efficient ligation of 5'-phosphate abasic strands by T4 DNA ligase in templated ligations has long been known, but to the best of our knowledge, the ligation behavior of a 5'-single"", ""product inhibition by reducing the stability difference between the intermediate complex and the product duplex. This dual role of the enzyme in facilitating rapid ligation and overcoming product inhibition suggests that prebiotic replication might have required interactions with surfaces or aqueous complexes that bound the intermediate complex more strongly than the product duplex, thereby facilitating turnover. LIDA involves two coupled cycles initiated by the introduction of a target template (DNA-I) in the presence of an excess of four fragments, two of which (Ia and IbP) constitute the target sequence after their ligation. In the first step, the DNA-I hybridizes with one of two complementary fragments; the hybridization of the 5'-phosphate abasic containing fragment IIaP to the DNA-I is shown in the scheme in Figure . Next, the other fragment IIb hybridizes forming a ternary complex. The T4 DNA ligase present in the solution can ligate the ternary complex to generate the product duplex. Upon spontaneous dissociation of this product duplex, the newly synthesized DNA-II is liberated, which can template the formation of DNA-I through similar steps (Cycle II, Figure ). Using standard conditions, the amount of fluorescent DNA-I formed from the ligation of the Ia and IbP fragments was monitored as a function of time using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) according to our previously reported method. The resulting kinetic profiles represent DNA-I formation versus time for a reaction initiated with 14 nM DNA-I (solid circles, 0.01 equivalents with respect to Ia) and a reaction with no initial DNA-I (open circles, Figure ). Such sigmoidal kinetic profiles are indicative of cross-catalysis: the initial exponential growth of the product followed by a reduction"", ""ConclusionIn conclusion, it has been shown that the addition of an abasic group at the ligation site instead of thymidine decreases the product duplex affinity constants for a particular 18mer duplex from 10 12 M -1 to 10 8 M -1 and the intermediate complex from 10 4 -10 5 M -1 to 10 3 -10 4 M -1 at 30 °C, the optimal replication temperature for this sequence. However, in the presence of an enzyme, the stability gap between the abasic-containing product and intermediate complexes is reduced from 10 4 -10 5 to 10 2 . We attribute this surprising difference to the stronger affinity of the enzyme for the intermediate rather than product complexes. This finding explains how we observe very fast selfreplication with LIDA despite the expected product inhibition. Indeed, our kinetic model reveals how rapid self-replication can be achieved even when the affinity constants are higher for the product duplex and the intermediate complex; a fast enough kcat is required together with a high enough affinity constant for the intermediate complex. Altogether, both the abasic group at the ligation site (which preferentially destabilizes the product duplex) and T4 DNA ligase (which preferentially stabilizes the intermediate) play significant roles in achieving rapid isothermal DNA self-replication. Therefore, a successful oligonucleotide self-replication system should incorporate product destabilization and a catalyst that favors the intermediate complex to further overcome product inhibition. These results can guide efforts to generate autonomous self-replicating oligonucleotides that use chemical rather than enzymatic ligation.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.

These results suggested that product inhibition is important as the rate of dissociation of the template:product strongly influences the success of the self-replication. Yet the overall stability of the intermediate complex also plays a significant role, which had until now been overlooked. In addition, simulations were conducted with 5 x kcat and 0.2 kcat to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the rate of ligation. When the kcat is 5 times faster than the value determined from our best fit of the data, the self-replication was much faster than what we observed. Conversely, the ligation rate was much slower when kcat was reduced by a factor of (0.2 x kcat), resulting in slow amplification of the templates (Figure ). These simulations are consistent with previous work that showed a strong dependence of replication on the magnitude of kcat of ligation. These simulations reveal two important take-home messages for developers of nonenzymatic self-replicating systems: they should focus on ways to stabilize the intermediate complex as well as ways to destabilize the product duplex and select rapid ligation strategies. Regarding the latter, very little product was observed within the first 7200 seconds (2 hours) of reaction when kcat was reduced to 0.1kcat (simulation not shown).Next, to provide some insight as to how the presence of the abasic affected the interactions with the enzyme, we determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat and Km for the ligation reaction in Cycle I for the system with and without the abasic group.

This resulted in formation of the catalyst in the form of a dry powder. Characterization was carried out using diffuse reflectance measurements where a strong plasmon absorption band was observed at 520 nm (see SI-1), confirming the presence of Au nanoparticles in size range of 10 to 20 nm. In a typical experiment, a loosely packed bed of catalyst was placed in the reaction chamber and purged with dry nitrogen for a few hours and subsequently, the reaction chamber was evacuated. Following this, H 2 and D 2 gases (both 99.99% pure) were filled in equal amounts with a total pressure of 1 bar. Reaction was carried out in a closed system (with intermittent sampling), either by heating the catalyst bed using a heater under dark conditions (thermal)or under light illumination of the catalyst bed (light-induced).A schematic diagram of our experimental setup is shown in figure (left panel). It consists of a custom-made stainless steel reaction chamber equipped with several gas inlets mbar (sampling off). For monitoring progress of the reaction, a small part of gas mixture (less than 1 %) from the reaction chamber was sent into sampling chamber via the solenoid valve.

In our experiments we observed that light absorption leads to heating of the catalyst bed, and hence a thinner sample was preferred to reduce the thermal contribution which could potentially obscure our results.

As observed in case of thermally-driven reaction, the quantityf 2 HD f H 2 f D 2increases steadily with time and eventually reaches steady state yielding the equilibrium constant under these conditions. Since control experiments (in absence of Au nanoparticeles) already establish that reaction is mainly driven by the presence of Au nanoparticles, we interpret the temperature corresponding to the value of K eq at a given light intensity to be a measure of energy available to the reactants at the active site. We denote this quantity as an effective temperature (T eff ) of the reaction site.A closer look at these curves (figure ) shows that as laser intensity is increased, resulting value of K eq and hence T eff obtained increases systematically (see table ). Progress of initial part of the reaction, analogous to thermally-driven case, is depicted in figure . Quite clearly, as laser intensity (and hence T eff ) increases, rate of formation of HD and corresponding rate constants increase. Using rate constants obtained at different T eff , we estimate the activation energy in this case to be 0.21 ± 0.02 eV (figure ). Most significant point emerging from these observations is that, activation energy obtained in the case of', 'Identifying signatures of thermal and non-thermal reaction pathways in plasmon induced H 2 + D 2 exchange reaction In this work we demonstrate a strategy for identifying experimental signatures of thermal and non-thermal effects in plasmon mediated heterogeneous catalytic chemistry, a topic widely debated and discussed in the literature. Our method is based on monitoring the progress of plasmon-induced (or thermally-driven) reaction, carried out in a closed system, all the way to equilibrium. Initial part of evolution of the reaction provides information about kinetics, whereas at later times the equilibrium concentrations provide information about effective temperature at the reaction sites.Combining these two pieces of information we estimate the activation energies. Using this strategy on H 2 (g) + D 2 (g) ----2 HD(g) isotope exchange reaction, catalyzed by Au nanoparticles under thermally-driven and light-induced conditions, we estimate the activation energies to be 0.75 ± 0.02 eV and 0.21 ± 0.02 eV, respectively.

Here, the blue curve depicts K eq evaluated using statistical thermodynamics over a range of temperatures (see SI-2 for details) and the points show values available in literature. From the variation in rate constants observed with temperature, activation energies were evaluated for both light and thermally-driven reactions. A comparison of these allows us to deduce signatures of different pathways in both these cases.In order to test the possibility of any spurious signal HD signal originating from catalytic activity of the metallic walls of the reaction chamber, control experiments were carried out with only the silica powder (Au nanoparticles absent). In case of thermally-driven reaction, HD fraction observed in absence of Au nanoparticles was smaller than 5% of the total HD produced (SI-3). For light-induced reaction, this quantity was several orders of magnitude smaller (SI-3). These observations establish that HD production in our system is mainly catalyzed by the presence of Au nanoparticles and contribution of any other part of the reaction chamber (such as stainless steel surface etc.) is relatively much smaller.Consequently, we have ignored this small fraction of HD in further analysis of our results.', '60-100 sec. These settings ensured that there is a steady state build up of gas pressure in the sampling chamber (typically, 1 -5 × 10 -6 mbar) which is detected by the mass spectrometer.For thermal experiments, a stainless steel cup shaped holder for the catalyst bed with a cartridge type heater attached at the bottom (outside the reaction chamber) was used. A home-built temperature controller was used to control the catalyst bed temperature within 1 K of the set temperature over the entire course of measurements. Temperature was monitored using a K-type thermocouple tip (0.3 mm diameter) immersed in the catalyst bed. Thickness of the catalyst bed was 5 mm for thermal experiments and temperature difference over this thickness was measured to be less than 3 K. Reactant gases, H 2 and D 2 were allowed to mix for 20 to 30 min in the reaction chamber before heating was started. Sampling of gas mixture was started after a steady temperature was attained on catalytic sample. For the light driven reaction, second harmonic of pulsed Nd +3 :YAG laser (Spectra Physics, Ascend, pulse width:200ns, repetition rate: 1 kHz, wavelength: 532 nm) was used at different intensities. A collimated laser beam with 8 mm cross sectional diameter was made incident on the catalyst (1 mm thick bed) sample to excite the Au nanoparticles.For both thermal and light-induced reactions, sampling performed at initial stages of the reaction was used to determine the change in fraction of HD, using which initial rate and rate constants were calculated.

It means the evaluation of kinetics is not necessary to rely on the TST in our newly provided dynamic computational strategy, which provides a benchmark to evaluate the validity of TST. As shown in Figure and Table , there is significant deviation for the calculated kinetics in TST, indicating the limitation of TST for reaction kinetics, or at least for the on-surface diffusion processes. Our calculations showed the deviation for TST is particularly significant at high temperature. Such as, the APD for diffusion barrier is as high to 30.4%, and the rate constant k is even overestimated by an APD value of 184% at 900 K. The deviation of TST is shown to reduce along with the drop of temperature. It has been proved again that TST is improper for the kinetics of low barrier process, further revealing the necessity for using dynamic computational strategy in direct evaluation of the more accurate catalytic kinetics in quantitative. It is also suggested that the non-Arrhenius behavior of an elementary process, which should be universal in dynamics, can only be accessed by the direct computation of k from the average diffusion time of MD trajectories.Our proposed dynamic computational strategy also provides a chance to evaluate the reliability of the common static computational strategy. As shown in Figure and Table , there is significant deviation for static computational strategy in quantitative, in which the APD for the calculated thermodynamics and kinetics are within the range of 30% to 37% and 157% to 266%, respectively, revealing the limitation of ideal statistical models. We are pleased to find that there is consistent variation tendency for the temperature-dependent thermodynamics between static and dynamic computational strategies, indicating the applicability of static computational strategy in', '3 ns long MD simulations at each of seven temperatures, that is 300 ∼ 900 K.We obtained the smooth 2-D PMF surfaces for CO adsorbate on Ru(0001) surface at 300 ∼ 900 K (see Figure and S5), displaying the intuitive pictures of temperature-dependent thermodynamics. However, the thermodynamic contribution of adsorbate in-plane motion is missed when the phase space is projected to a 2-D PMF surface. We thus proposed here using a properly defined region other than a single local minimum (or saddle) point to include the contribution of adsorbate in-plane motion. Our results unexpectedly showed that the relative free energy between top and hcp sites increases rather than reduces as the temperature raising, being contrary to the intuition (see Figure ). The PMF surfaces in Figure and S5 obviously suggest that the free energy curve in top site is flatter than that in hcp site, in agreement with our previous results that the frequency of the two in-plane modes is lower in the top site, and further suggests the top site has less steric interactions. Therefore, the in-plane motion is easier in the top site, which makes the adsorption and movement of CO molecule on top site is more facilitated by entropic effect, resulting in the observed counterintuitive temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties.In the common computational treatment in theoretical catalysis, the reaction kinetics are mostly obtained from the combination of calculated free energy barrier and TST. Our proposed efficient dynamic computational strategy can not only provide the free energy barrier by a proper statistical protocol, but also calculate the diffusion rate constant (k) directly from the average diffusion time of MD trajectories. It means the evaluation of kinetics is not necessary to rely on the TST in our newly', ""Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Thermodynamics CalculationThe Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out in the canonical ensemble from 300 to 900 K, with the Nosé-Hoover thermostat for temperature controlling. The velocity-verlet algorithm was employed to update the velocities and coordinates with a time step of 0.5 fs. The energy and force were obtained directly from the NN PES. The 2-D PMF surfaces were generated from the MD trajectories using the two in-plane coordinates of the carbon atom as the reaction coordinates. It is worth noting that the thermodynamic contribution of the two in-plane modes of adsorbate is missed in a 2-D PMF surface scheme.Therefore, relative free energy for the adsorbate on a specified on-surface site was evaluated by considering the occupation probability of adsorbate not only on a local minimum point but also within a region near degeneracy in free energy (setting as 1 kcal/mol in this work) around the local minimum point. Similarly, the free energy barrier for adsorbate diffusion was evaluated by considering the occupation probability of adsorbate on a 2-D area of the PMF with the close free energy (within 1 kcal/mol above the transition state, illustrated as Figure in the supporting material). The rate constant of barrier corssing k is evaluated by TST ask = k B T h exp [ - ∆ ̸ = r G ø m RT ] ,(3)where ∆ ̸ = r G ø m is the free energy barrier.

The PMF surfaces clearly show significant barriers separating different binding sites. The diffusion of CO adsorbate should quite likely follow a typical jumping-amongminima behavior, making an elementary process in surface catalysis. The diffusion kinetics could be obtained based on the calculated free energy barrier in conjunction with TST, likely the most common approach in theoretical catalysis. Moreover, we would like to mention another approach to calculate the diffusion kinetics based on the dynamic protocol proposed here, that is, calculating the diffusion rate constant (k) directly from the average diffusion time of MD trajectories jumping from one adsorption site to another.

Such experimental binding energies are generally valid under two assumptions: i) the center-of-mass axis of the monomers is approximately parallel with the a axis of inertia, and ii) the centrifugal distortion is mainly due to a single vibrational mode along the center-of-mass axis. While the latter is true for all of the studied complexes, the former approximation is only valid from Ar••OCS down the group.The agreement between the experimental estimates and the calculated D E data is remarkably good for the rare gas complexes (within ""chemical accuracy"" of 0.4 kJ/mol), given how naïve such a fit to a Lennard-Jones model is. The Hg• • •OCS complex is again an outlier: the experimental binding energy is significantly weaker than the calculated value. Relativistic effects are likely to play a significant role in both Hg and Xe complexes.

The binding energies obtained using the supermolecular approach (ie. from E complex -E monomers ) should be identical to the Lennard-Jones model when B2PLYP-derived data is used in both. The large discrepancy between the r B2PLYP e results and all other results is due to the significant underprediction of the centrifugal', 'Binding and interaction energiesThe overall binding energy of a complex (D E ) can be defined as the experimentally observable change in the energy upon binding of the monomers. Ignoring basis set and size consistency errors, it can be thought of as the difference of the zero-point corrected energy of the complex from the sum of the zero-point corrected energies of the relaxed monomers. Alternatively, it can be thought of as a sum of the interaction energy (E int ), the deformation energy (∆E D ) and the change in the zero-point energy (∆E ZPE ). The interaction energy is widely used as a benchmark quantity for computational methods, as calculating E int requires no geometry optimisation, but just a handful of single-point energy calculations.As a first look on the trends in the interaction energies in this set, we have applied the SAPT decomposition to the B2PLYP-based r SE e geometries. The contribution of the SAPT components of the interaction energy is shown in Fig. . The interaction with the rare gases is completely dispersion dominated, with electrostatic contribution increasing slightly down the group. The sole exception is the non-rare gas Hg••OCS complex, where the interaction contains a significant induction contribution.

The convergence of the correlation energy is not so certain, and can be improved in three ways: i) by calculating correlation at a higher level of theory, ii) by using a larger basis set or adding diffuse and/or midpoint functions, or iii) by correlating all electrons in the calculation. Higher level correlation in dispersiondominated complexes of similar interaction energies was studied by Řezač and Hobza: the CCSDT(Q) correction to a CCSD(T) energy accounts for only 1-3% of the interaction energy. Due to the enormous computational cost of CCSDT(Q) calculations, we currently cannot investigate higher order effects on this system. Basis set incompleteness at the CCSD(T)/ [3,4]-ζ level is about ∼50 mÅ in the very weakly bound Ar• • •Ar complex, and decreases to ∼5 mÅ for a more strongly bound complex, such as NH 3 • •HF. The effect of increasing basis set size in the δ(T) component of the MP2+δ(T) recipe is shown in Fig. , in the left panel. Note that the O=C••S angle in the r (2) m structure ( ) is adjusted here by assuming the OCS monomer is linear. With increasing basis set size ( ), the intermonomer distance hardly changes, and the main difference is in the O=C••Xe angle. This further confirms that the structure is likely', '. The calculated MP2+δ(T) binding energies D E are in a good agreement with the experimental values using the Lennard-Jones model for complexes up to Kr. This agreement breaks down with in heavier complexes likely due to relativistic effects. The minor disagreement in the interaction energies compared to previous CCSD(T) literature data can be explained by basis set incompleteness in the literature results. The deformation of the OCS monomer from its equilibrium structure upon complexation is predicted to be minimal, with the largest bend of 0.3 • predicted for Hg• • •OCS. The mass-dependent r (2) m structures of the Xe and Ne complexes differ significantly from the r SE e structures. The bond lengths and angles in the OCS monomer are distorted in the r ([1,2]) m fits, especially the position of the O-atom. However, with the OCS monomer constrained to its equilibrium geometry, the mass-dependent structures are likely the most accurate structures ever obtained for the two complexes. The 43 mÅ difference in the monomer separation in the MP2+δ(T) and r (2) m structures can be partially explained by the lack of diffuse functions in the cc-pwcVnZ basis sets: upon augmentation the difference drops to 15 mÅ. The closest agreement with the r (2) m structure could be obtained by adding the 4-th order relativistic correction (+δ 4 rel ) to the MP2+δ(T) results, highlighting the importance of relativistic effects. However, this procedure cannot be generally recommended, as the scalar relativistic effects are double-counted.

We chose Figshare as its service provider to deliver a modern interface and ability to both host and interactively display data natively within the browser. Our authors and readers have made good use of these features by uploading crystal structures, computational files, videos, and more that can be processed and manipulated without the need for specialized software. ChemRxiv accepts all data types from authors-removing the limitations imposed by PDF and Word-providing a richer, more valuable reading experience for users. Since launch, we have added a number of new features, including a ""Follow"" feature, which allows readers to create notifications and RSS feeds based on precise search criteria, and an interactive citation-formatting tool. Our automated scans for plagiarism, viruses and malware, and improvements to the curation tools allow triage before posting to be quick, in fewer than two business days, and often in less than one day! Several new features will be available with the next release, including an interactive search widget to the ""Funding"" field. All of this, plus positive user feedback and the establishment of our global three-society governance, means that we are moving ChemRxiv from the beta stage to a full-service resource.Migrating ChemRxiv from beta does not mean that improvements and new features are complete. There are plenty of exciting new projects underway-including a feature that helps authors eliminate duplicative steps at manuscript submission time, called ChemRxiv ""Direct Journal Transfer"". One of the most highly valued features of ChemRxiv is the simplicity of submission. Authors drag and drop files into the browser, complete one screen of information, then click ""Submit"". To extend this simplicity, ChemRxiv is developing a tool to allow authors to send their', '""Submit"". To extend this simplicity, ChemRxiv is developing a tool to allow authors to send their preprint to a journal submission system in two clicks. Authors can smoothly transition from preprint posting, to submitted-and ultimately published-article without having to re-enter their information into a second interface. ChemRxiv intends to make this feature available in the next few months and will launch with support for journals owned by the American Chemical Society, Royal Society of Chemistry, and the German Chemical Society, with journals from other publishers to join on a rolling basis thereafter. This feature will be free and available to authors worldwide.In just a few clicks, your preprint will be able to go from preprint to submitted article using Direct Journal Transfer!

865,"1.7 V must be applied to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the bottleneck of water splitting. Even the most efficient OER electrocatalysts to date show significant overpotentials (up to 0.4 V), which leads to a significant amount of energy being spent on producing oxygen, a product with low market value. As a result, the deployment of the green hydrogen production market is hindered: green hydrogen currently accounts for only 4% of the overall production worldwide, equivalent to 3.8 Mt in 2021. Interestingly, this is in line with the amount of electricity produced worldwide using solar PV, accounting for 3.6% (179 TWh in 2021). Therefore, boosting the largescale production of green hydrogen requires the parallel optimization and scale-up of both solar PV and electrolyzers. Value-added oxidation reactions are an attractive pathway to further reduce green hydrogen production costs by reducing energy consumption and adding market value.

The current disparity between the electrolyzers manufacturing capacity and the ambitious set targets can also be regarded as a potential windfall, given that the European interest in hydrogen could provide for a more certain panorama for private capital to invest in electrolyzer manufacture.

Copyright 2022, SciOpen.light, thereby making it a revolutionary technology due to its simplicity. In fact, photocatalytic water splitting is considered the ""holy grail"" reaction in physical chemistry, as it can directly generate H2 from water. This is a significant advantage, as it enables the production of a solar fuel without the need for external electricity, resulting in lower operating expenses (OPEX) costs.Photocatalysis by definition is a heterogeneous type of catalysis, requiring photons with adequate energy (see Figure ) to activate the solid semiconductor/catalyst and split', 'H2 requires less theoretical electricity consumption, as previously reported and as schematized in Figure . Noteworthy, the theoretical operating voltage for a device performing biomass electrolysis could be as low as 0.5 V. From a PC/PEC point of view, this voltage could be achieved with the photovoltage generated by single junction photoabsorbers, as reported in Figure . This is a net advantage over water electrolysis, since the higher operating voltages required to split water necessitates multi-absorber tandems connected in series to yield additive photovoltages. Furthermore, biomass oxidation offers the opportunity to produce value-added chemicals, representing a highly efficient power-to-X (X = fuel and chemicals) conversion. These combined aspects have the potential to produce green hydrogen at relatively low cost, adding further value by the generation of diverse chemical commodities. ', 'Green hydrogenGreen hydrogen is produced by using water and sunlight (or renewable-driven electricity). There are mainly three types of solar-driven water electrolysis processes: photocatalytic (PC) water splitting, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, and photovoltaics (PV) combined with electrolysis. Among the above three approaches, PV-driven water splitting already reaches relatively high TRLs (TRL 7), with recently demonstrated solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies up to about 20%. Higher efficiencies are foreseen in the near future using tandem solar cells based on improved hybrid organicinorganic perovskite light absorbers. Recently, the certified solar to electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) tandems of lead halide perovskite with silicon has reached 32.5 %, a value previously achieved only by expensive III/V semiconductors. Figure reports the AM0 and AM1.5 solar spectra, together with the portion of the spectrum accessible by a double junction, tandem perovskite/Si cell (see Figure caption for details). The integration of the AM1.5 spectrum up to the NIR cutoff (1107 nm) set by the Si bottom absorber returns an accessible photon flux of about 2.46 × 10 21 s -1 •m -2 . Given an PCE of 30%, the photon flux effectively converted into electricity (~7.38 × 10 20 s -1 •m -2 ) generates a current density of almost 120 A•m -2 , provided by the PV module to the electrolyzer (for this estimation, the PCE was considered equal to 30% for both absorbers in the tandem device). Hence, there is the need to develop electrocatalysts able to provide current densities of about 20 mA cm -2 with minimal overvoltage losses, i.e. less than 0.3 V for', 'current densities of about 20 mA cm -2 with minimal overvoltage losses, i.e. less than 0.3 V for extended periods of time (months or years), using cheap and earthabundant elements.

In this example, the hybrid organic/inorganic perovskite is the wide-bandgap top absorber, with a bandgap of 1.68 eV (cutoff at ~ 740 nm).

One of the major challenges is to lower the LCOH to 2$/kg to become competitive with fossil sources.

Genetic algorithms are a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics in biological systems . They proceed via an iterative process involving a population of candidate solutions that undergo recombination and mutation to create new offspring solutions. A selection process based on the fitness of each solution, or model, is used to determine which solutions survive into the next generation. Just as evolutionary pressures are the primary driver for shaping the evolution of organisms, the metric used to determine each candidate model\'s ability to survive selection and go on to participate in breeding the next generation of models is of central importance to shaping the evolution of candidate models in a genetic algorithm. Since the goal is to discover network Hamiltonian models that can maximally and reliably simulate the self-assembly of amyloid fibril network structures, we define a metric for amyloid fibril production called fibril fraction , which is defined simply as the number of nodes in the system that make up part of a region of perfect amyloid fibril divided by the total number of nodes in the simulation (e.g. in Figure ).

The most obvious difference between the four spectra is the lower intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra of the cell on the soft PA gel attached to the custom substrate. Because this feature is absent in the spectra of the stiff PA gel on a custom substrate, it is not likely due to either the custom substrate itself or to differences in the reagents used to attach the photopolymerized and thermally polymerized gels to the custom substrate and commercial substrate, respectively. Instead, we attribute the low intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra acquired from the soft PA gel on the custom substrate to a low degree of polymerization within this gel. This interpretation is supported by our observation that the intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 increases with the UV exposure time (Figure .b), and prior reports that assign the spectral peaks at 830-850 cm -1 to polyacrylamide .Comparison of the average spectra acquired from cells on each combination of PA gel stiffness and substrate (Figure .b) reveals the spectra acquired from both the custom substrate and the commercially available (Thorlabs) substrate are roughly comparable. However, the average spectra from CHO cells on the custom substrate have higher standard deviation.Because photopolymerization produces gels with a larger range of stiffness than thermal polymerization, this higher variance is due to the use of photopolymerization to create the PA gels on the custom substrates and thermal polymerization to create the PA gels on the substrates purchased from Thorlabs.

However, these Thorlabs substrates were relatively expensive, and the difficulty of removing the cellular material and PA gel residue without damaging the silicate coating prevented their reuse. Furthermore, their dimensions of the commercially available substrates (6 mm tall and 12.7 mm diameter) were poorly suited for cell analysis because their height made media spillage inevitable during handling. These challenges inspired us to fabricate an inexpensive custom Raman-compatible substrate with dimensions that are better suited for constructing the envisioned biomaterial screening platform.Here, we use standard fabrication techniques to produce a custom Raman-compatible substrate that supports microarray construction and the acquisition of Raman spectra with sufficient quality to allow accurate identification cell phenotype with our PLS-DA and Raman spectroscopy approach. We show that these substrates are compatible with the chemistries that are commonly employed for microarray construction to covalently attach soft and stiff fibronectinfunctionalized PA gels that mimic properties of the HSC niche to their surfaces .

Nonetheless, these results demonstrate the spectra acquired from living cells on fibronectin-functionalized PA gels that were covalently attached to the custom Raman-compatible substrates had sufficient intensities to discern subtle spectral differences between closely related cells. Having demonstrated that low identification errors can be obtained using laboratory cell lines cultured on custom Raman-compatible substrates functionalized with a fibronectin-coated PA gel, we next assessed whether the phenotypes of freshly isolated LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs seeded on these substrates could be accurately identified.

Although proteins must also experience polarization effects in both the charges and Lennard-Jones parameters, protein force field parameters have always, to date, been assigned from a transferable library. This leads to an inconsistency in the parametrization strategy used for protein force fields and bespoke small molecule force fields. This is potentially problematic when studying properties that depend on the electrostatic potentials of proteins, such as their interactions with small molecules, and there is no clear way around this using traditional force field fitting methods.To improve the consistency between charge and Lennard-Jones parameters, and also reduce the reliance on fitting to experimental data, one could either directly fit non-bonded MM parameters to reproduce quantum mechanical (QM) energies and forces, or derive the non-bonded parameters of the force field directly from QM.

This is in contrast to the performance of RESP charges, which have been shown to be significantly more conformation-dependent for an ensemble of polypeptide structures. Additional simulations demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of deriving bespoke parameters for a protein-ligand complex. The computed relative binding free energy of indole and benzofuran to the lysozyme protein using the environment-specific force fields (-0.4 kcal/mol) was in excellent agreement with experiment (-0.6 kcal/mol), and was substantially more accurate than standard force fields (-2.4 kcal/mol). However, the force field was in need of further development as the bespoke non-bonded terms were used in combination with standard OPLS-AA bonded parameters.The use of these parameters potentially limits the accuracy of the force field due to interdependency between the bonded terms, particularly the torsional parameters, and the non-bonded components of the force field. This issue is the subject of the current paper.In standard transferable force fields, the torsional component is typically parameterized using QM dihedral energy scans, with the difference between analogous MM and QM energy scans minimized by fitting the torsional parameters. Reparameterization of the torsional terms has been shown to be a crucial step in improving the accuracy of force fields and this has recently been demonstrated for AMBER ff15ipq, CHARMM36 and OPLS-AA/M.

As in Section 2.1, the ONETEP linear-scaling DFT software is used to compute the ground state electron density of the five proteins, and assign the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters from the partitioned atomic electron densities. Consistent with the QUBE small molecule approach, every atom in the protein is assigned bespoke non-bonded parameters derived from the quantum mechanical electron density. To model polarization effects in the condensed phase, the electron density is computed first in vacuum, then using an implicit solvent model with a dielectric constant of 80. The iPol approach used in AMBER ff15ipq is then employed, with all non-bonded parameters set halfway between their vacuum and condensed phase values. The purpose of this approach, as well as overcoming issues associated with closing of the electronic band gap in large system sizes, is to account for electrostatics and induction in the condensed phase in an effective manner using a fixed point charge force field. Typical computational requirements for a QM calculation on a small protein (≈ 1000 atoms) are approximately 2000 cpuhrs. In order to provide a consistent and computationally efficient approach to assigning the non-bonded parameters, we recommend minimizing the experimental structure using a standard transferable force field in explicit water prior to the DFT calculation. In this study, we used the OPLS-AA/M force field for the initial minimization. Following non-bonded parameter assignment, bond, angle and torsion parameters were assigned as described in Section 2 based', 'which would be problematic if the charges show strong conformation dependence. However, Manz and Sholl have demonstrated that DDEC charges are transferable between different conformations of a molecule (as measured by their ability to recreate the QM electrostatic potential), and they conclude that the charges are suitable for the construction of flexible force fields. Furthermore, it should be noted that atoms-in-molecule electron density partitioning lends itself naturally to the derivation of both off-site charges to model electron anisotropy (such as lone pairs and σ-holes) and atomic polarizabilities, though we have not yet investigated a fully polarizable force field.In keeping with our goal of deriving force field parameters directly from QM, rather than fitting to experiment, we have supplemented the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameters with harmonic bond and angle parameters derived directly from the QM Hessian matrix. There are a number of methods available for deriving bonded parameters from the QM Hessian matrix, but our recent adaptation of the Seminario method (which we name the modified Seminario method) is conceptually quite straightforward whilst yielding parameters that reproduce QM vibrational frequencies with a mean unsigned error of 49 cm -1 , below that of OPLS (59 cm -1 ). Collectively, we have named these methods the QUantum mechanical BEspoke (QUBE) force field. This name reflects the fact that force field parameters are derived by the user specifically for the small molecule under study, directly from QM calculations. We have released a software toolkit (QUBEKit) that facilitates the derivation of small organic molecule force field parameters, and also', 'to be suitable for use in flexible force field design in multiple works, because they are able to reproduce the underlying QM electrostatic dependence while exhibiting low conformation-dependence. The charges are specific to the system under study and, by performing the QM calculation in the presence of an implicit solvent model, polarization of the charges in the condensed phase can be included in the model. The dispersion and exchange-repulsion interactions are described using a Lennard-Jones potential with a form:E LJ = i<j A ij r 12 ij - B ij r 6 ij .(1)The dispersion coefficient, B ij , is calculated from the partitioned electron density by using the Tkatchenko-Scheffler relationship to rescale the free atom dispersion coefficient by the computed volume of the atom in the molecule. The standard combination rule,B ij = B i B j, can then be used to determine heteroatomic dispersion coefficients. The A ij parameter, which describes the short-range repulsion between overlapping electron clouds, cannot be readily calculated directly from the electron density. Instead it is computed by requiring that the minimum in the interatomic Lennard-Jones potential coincides with the estimated van der Waals radius of the atom in the molecule. This non-bonded parameter derivation scheme requires just one fitting parameter per element (corresponding to the van der Waals radius of the free atom in vacuum).', 'that facilitates the derivation of small organic molecule force field parameters, and also allows the user to derive the positions of off-site charges to model anisotropic electron density and to fit dihedral parameters to QM torsion scans. QUBE force fields have been derived for 109 small organic molecules, and yield mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm 3 , 0.79 kcal/mol and 1.17 kcal/mol in computed liquid density, heat of vaporization and free energy of hydration. These results are competitive with standard transferable force fields, which have been extensively fit to properties such as these.To achieve our goal of employing the QUBE force field in computer-aided drug design applications, we require a compatible protein force field. Since the non-bonded parametrization strategy employed in QUBE is very different to that used in the standard biomolecular force fields (e.g. AMBER, OPLS, CHARMM), there is no reason to believe that they are compatible. However, by implementing the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameter derivation methods in the ONETEP linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) software, we have shown that it is feasible to derive these charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for entire proteins. In this way, the number of fitting parameters is substantially reduced, and we have a consistent parametrization approach that can be applied to both small and large molecules, including entire biomolecular assemblies. Since, in this approach, all non-bonded parameters are derived from a single QM calculation, both the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters naturally include the native state polarization effects of the environment.

As such, the airexposed configurations of the interfacial ion are not solvated very differently as compared to the same ion in bulk water. Other studies have also pointed to asymmetric solvation environments around anions (more so than cations), even in bulk water. Our results suggest that the solvation environments of various soft anions are asymmetric both in bulk water and at the air/water interface, leading to VIEs that are essentially indistinguishable.the VIEs of these species in water, is mostly performed at photon energies where the attenuation length of the outgoing photoelectron is 1-10 nm, suggesting that the experiments are more sensitive to solutes at the interface. However, there has been little prior investigation of whether the VIEs themselves are sensitive to interfacial solvation, which is an especially relevant question for soft anions that are known to partition preferentially at the air/water interface. Our calculations suggest that differences between bulk and interfacial VIEs are inconsequential, which we attribute to similarities in first-shell hydration structure in both environments. These striking similarities serve as a reminder that although the structure of the air/water interface may be modified by the presence of dissolved ions, the hydration shell around a given solute may or may not be different than what it is bulk aqueous solution. Whereas liquid microjet', 'is hardly affected by the presence of the interface, even for surface-active ions such as I -, SCN -, NO - 3 , and ClO - 4 .

This hypothesis is readily dismissed upon examination of the MD trajectories, which reveal that both I -and SCN -at the air/water interface spend a significant amount of time in ""air-exposed"" configurations; see Fig. . Other studies have also concluded that interfacial iodide ions reside primarily in the topmost layer of the solvent, and that the presence of various Hofmeister ions disrupts the water network only in the first solvation shell. The role of ion-induced water-water correlations in explaining ionic strength effects on water\'s surface tension has been specifically highlighted. An explanation for the structural similarities that is consistent with the air-exposed solvation motifs that we observe is that hydration of soft anions involves strong hydrogen bonds on only one side of the ion, even in bulk water, with a hydrophobic pocket emerging on the opposite side. This idea has been put forward previously with regard to I -(aq), 141 IO - 3 (aq), <ref', 'of surface-active ions. VSFG experiments demonstrate that both ions have significant effects on the O-H stretching band of water. Halides ions were considered extensively in the very earliest studies of interfacial ion partitioning, 1,7 but SCN -(aq) at the air/water interface has also been considered in numerous studies. The latter ion has also been considered in the context of Hofmeister ""salting-out"" effects on proteins. For I -(aq), our DFT/PEqS calculations afford a VIE of 8.07 ± 0.28 eV in bulk simulations where there is no interface, as compared to 8.14±0.31 eV using snapshots extracted from the periodic slab calculations. (Uncertainties represent one standard deviation and characterize inhomogeneous broadening.) Both values are consistent with the experimental VIE, 7.93 eV. In case of SCN -(aq), bulk and slab simulations afford VIEs of 8.28 ± 0.27 eV and 8.44±0.29 eV, respectively, as compared to an experimental VIE of 8.17 eV. For both ions, the difference in the average VIE in the bulk versus the slab simulation is less than the half-width of the VIE distribution obtained upon thermal sampling.That said, interfacial VIEs reported in Table represent averages over the entire periodic slab, and both I -(aq) and SCN -(aq) visit both the interfacial and the bulk-like interior regions of the slab.

Our results are therefore consistent with the presumed surface-sensitivity of liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy, but also reveal that these values can likely be taken seriously as VIEs for bulk aqueous solutes.

Observed similarities in the solvation structure of bulk versus interfacial anions sets up another interesting conundrum, namely, how to reconcile these observations with shifts in the O-H stretching band of water are detected (using surface-selective vibrational spectroscopy) when soft ions are present at the air/water interface. Our results suggest that this is likely a second-shell (or possibly third-shell) solvation effect, resulting from subtle changes in the network of waterwater hydrogen bonds that are induced by the presence of the ion, rather than resulting directly from changes in ion-water hydrogen bonds at the interface.

The \uf073C3C4→\uf070*NO/CO interaction originates from the \uf073C3C4 orbital being parallel to the\uf020\uf070 orbital of the substituent. Likewise, \uf073C3C4→\uf073*NO/CO interaction arises from \uf073C3C4 orbital being antiperiplanar to the \uf073 orbital of the substituent. While \uf073C3C4→\uf070*NO/CO interaction is typical of allyl anion like resonance interaction, \uf073C3C4→\uf073*NO/CO interaction is akin to antiperiplanar interaction. The intensity of interaction will depend on the resonance accepting ability of the substituent in \uf073C3C4→\uf070*NO/CO interaction and \uf073-electron accepting ability in \uf073C3C4→\uf073*NO/CO interaction; the greater the ability, the more the interaction.In the instance where the group is located on a carbon-carbon \uf070-bond as in CH2=CHX (X = NO2, NO and CHO), \uf070CC→\uf070*NO/CO interaction will constitute a meaningful estimate of the resonance acceptor ability. The larger the interaction, the larger will be the resonance acceptor ability of the group. Further, the larger the \uf070CC→\uf070*NO/CO interaction, the lower will be the LUMO of the conjugated system. Thus, an estimate of the LUMO energy can provide an estimate of the resonance acceptor ability, in inverse relationship.The antiperiplanar interaction of a \uf073 bond with \uf073*CN in the NO2 and NO species and \uf073*CC(=O) in the CHO species in a geometrically well-defined arrangement, such as in substituted cyclohexane, provides a reasonably good measure of the \uf073-electron attracting ability of the substituent.

Particularly exciting is the potential use of quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Electronic structure calculations provide fundamental information about matter and are essential for research in chemistry, physics, and material science. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of finding the exact solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation scales factorially with the system size, limiting predictive power of quantum chemistry. This unfavorable scaling arises because of the quantum entanglement of electronic degrees of freedom in many-body wavefunctions. Because the wavefunction is a quantum object, one may expect that it could be encoded on a quantum device more effectively than on classical devices 1 , however, the exact details of effective quantum algorithms for solving the electronic Schrödinger equation remain elusive.The main task of an electronic structure calculation is finding the eigenvalues of given molecular Hamiltonian (i.e., electronic energies). One practical quantum algorithm for molecular simulations is called the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm . QPE-a quantum algorithm for evaluating eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator Ĥ-was expected to lead to an exponential speed-up of quantum simulation relative to classical algorithms. However, a disturbing feature of QPE is the large number of quantum operations that are needed to achieve the target precision: O(p -1 ) successive operations of e i Ĥt are needed for precision p.

To execute this operation, each of e i Ĥt is decomposed into millions or billions of quantum gates, which exceeds the capability of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices . Consequently, although QPE is an important milestone in quantum computing for quantum simulations, it is not practical for realistic applications . To address this limitation, a more NISQ-friendly algorithm with low circuit depths, called a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), was proposed . The VQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on variational principle. The algorithm entails preparing a parameterized quantum state on the quantum device and measuring the expectation value of the Hamiltonian on the trial state. The classical optimization procedure iteratively adjusts the parameters of the trial state to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. By leveraging classical optimization techniques with quantum measurements, VQE requires significantly smaller quantum resources compared to QPE. The VQE algorithm has been successfully deployed in ground-state simulations of small molecules on NISQ devices and is exploited in many algorithms for quantum computing for molecular simulations.The progress in the development of quantum algorithms with shallow circuit depths has enabled successful simulations of molecular ground-state energies. Many applications (e.g., spectroscopy, photochemistry), require going', 'ground-state energies. Many applications (e.g., spectroscopy, photochemistry), require going beyond ground-state calculations and computing excited states. The development of quantum algorithms for molecular excited states is more challenging compared to the ground-state algorithms. The existing quantum algorithms for excited states often require a large number of qubits and gate operations, which precludes their application to larger systems. This is because the excited states often have more complex wavefunctions (open-shell, multi-configurational) even when the corresponding ground states are well behaved. Furthermore, in contrast to the ground state (which is unique in the sense that it is the lowest-energy state), there are many excited states, so the quantum algorithms should be capable of targeting a specific state (or states)e.g., the lowest energy states or states in a particular energy range, states of a particular symmetry/spin, states of a particular character, etc.The success of the VQE algorithm for ground-state calculations has inspired extensions to excited states, leading to variational quantum deflation (VQD) , subspace-search VQE (SSVQE) , and other algorithms . The underlying framework of all VQE-based methods is variational principle. The VQE-based methods for excited states employ supplementary constraints, so that the resulting algorithms look for a minimum-energy state orthogonal to the previously computed states. For example, the central element of VQD is the penalty terms in the cost function (which is subject to minimization). The penalty terms quantify the overlap between the previously obtained solutions and the current target state. The minimization', 'on a quantum device and then solves the eigenvalue problem of Eq.

The number of matrix elements to measure on quantum computers and the dimension of the matrix to diagonalize on classical computers depend on the level of correlation treatment and the one-electron basis set. By restricting the excitation levels to singles and doubles, the quantum computer is required to measure about N ∼ n occ × n vir + n 2 occ × n 2 vir matrix elements and the classical computer is required to diagonalize N × N matrix, which scales as O(N 3 ). Although the dimension of the matrix M can considerably be reduced by utilizing the sparsity and symmetries of the Hamiltonian, the scaling quickly reaches the intractable regime as the system size increases.Eqs. ( ) and (22), which are the working equation of qEOM with the self-consistent manifold operator, are the same as in the standard EOM-CC method except for the form of the effective Hamiltonian. In the standard EOM-CC calculation, we iteratively determine only a few eigenvalues using the Davidson algorithm instead of explicit diagonalization of the entire matrix M . Here, we present the implementation of this idea within the qEOM method (we focus on the standard Davidson algorithm for low-lying states, but it can be extended to compute interior states or states of a particular character ).In order to compute J excited states, qEOM-UCC/Davidson starts with generating a set of appropriate L orthonormal guess vectors, {|b i ⟩} L≥J i=1 . Then, we measure the matrix elements of H in the given guess vector space and build the subspace Hamiltonian using a quantum', 'overlap between the previously obtained solutions and the current target state. The minimization of the VQD cost function ensures the mutual orthogonality of the computed eigenstates. Thus, the algorithm entails sequential calculations of the states. Importantly, these approaches do not guarantee resolving the full energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian, especially for near-degenerate states. Essential feature of the VQE-based approaches is the need to design the ansatz that effectively differentiates each eigenstate of the Hamiltonian from other states.In the classical quantum chemistry, the evaluation of excited states is also challenging . Among popular wavefunction-based approaches is the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) ansatz . In the complete many-body limit (i.e., when up to N -electron excitations are included), EOM-CC becomes identical to full configuration interaction (FCI)-the exact solution in the given one-electron basis set. In the case of the truncated many-electron basis, EOM-CC is superior to CI due to the incorporation of correlation through a similarity transformation, which also makes the method size intensive. Quantum adaptations of the EOM ansatz (qEOM) have been implemented and tested . In contrast to the standard EOM-CC, the reference wavefunction of its quantum counterpart comes from the groundstate VQE calculation with the UCC (unitary coupled-cluster) ansatz . UCC framework is Hermitian, provides an', 'C. Solving qEOM-UCCSD on quantum computers using a Davidson-like procedureSimilar to the classical electronic-structure calculations, the quantum version of EOM (qEOM) protocol computes ground state before solving the EOM problem by using variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with the choice of an appropriate ansatz, such as unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) and Hardware-efficient ansatz . As discussed in the previous section, we use the UCC ansatz with singles and doubles (qEOM-UCCSD)T = T1 + T2 = ia θ a i a † a a i + 1 4 ijab θ ab ij a † a a i a † b a j ,(23)where {θ} represents the set of variational parameters (same as the cluster amplitudes {t} in classical simulations).

However, the energy difference between 1 and 2 was not significant enough to ensure exclusive formation of the latter, thus reinforcing the results illustrated in Scheme 4. DFT calculations revealed that ""ring-walking"" of 1 en route to 2 might occur via 1,2-hydride shift via an energetically-favorable transition state TS1 (26.9 kcal•mol -1 ) in which C-H bond-cleavage is enabled by formation of a Ni-H bond. Interestingly, the shifting hydrogen atom is shared by the two Ni centers at unsymmetrical distances of 1.5 and 1.9 Å and by the C2 carbon atom (1.6 Å). An otherwise similar TS2 was located by starting with 2 as precursor instead with an activation barrier of 22.9 kcal•mol -1 . Putting these results into perspective, the 1,2-hydride shift might not occur directly from carbon to carbon, but rather in a two-step process via the intermediacy of Int-1 possessing a µ-hydride bridge between the two Ni centers. Unfortunately, all our attempts at either isolating Int-1 or detect the formation of the highly shielded bridging µ-hydride by NMR spectroscopy were unsuccessful, suggesting that these species might not be particularly stable in solution. This notion gains credence by the kinetically instability found for Int-1, possessing a higher energy when compared to both 1 and 2 (>17.0 kcal•mol -1 ), thus precluding its isolation or detection by conventional analytical techniques. The results compiled in Schemes 4 and 5 suggest that a nickel translocation throughout the arene backbone might hold promise to establish a new rationale for enabling C-C bond formations of aryl pivalates at remote C(sp 2 )-H sites.

The arene fragment interacts with the Ni-Ni core via both a s-bond and a h 2 -interaction, with a bridging pivalate between the two Ni centers. Given that NBO analysis of I showed a symmetrical distribution of charge at the Ni-Ni core, we wondered whether a dynamic motion between the Ni-Ni core might enable a formal translocation of the Ni center at a proximal C(sp 2 ) site by forming a new s-bond and a h 2 -interaction with the arene backbone. If successful, such a process might constitute a formal metal translocation over the arene backbone, thus setting the basis for establishing a new rationale for enabling Ni-catalyzed C(sp 2 )-H functionalization of C-O electrophiles via ""ring-walking"" in the absence of directing groups or metalation events. Prompted by our interest in Ni-catalyzed C-H functionalization, we report herein the successful realization of this goal. Experimental and DFT studies demonstrate the viability for enabling a ""ring-walking"" prior to C-C bond formation, with a mechanism likely arising from an abnormal 1,2-hydride shift. Our study began by preparing a representative set of Ni-Ni complexes by exposure of aryl pivalates to Ni(cod)2/PCy3 at 50 ºC or [Ni(PCy3)2]2N2 at rt in toluene (Scheme 3). The choice of 1-8 was not arbitrary; 1 and 2 were designed to study the dynamics on p-extended systems -substrates particularly suited for Ni-catalyzed C-O functionalization <ref type=""bibr""', 'formations of aryl pivalates at remote C(sp 2 )-H sites. Thus, we turned our attention to study the reactivity of Ni-Ni species with an appropriate nucleophilic counterpart (Scheme 7). As anticipated, 1-phenylnaphthalene 9 (61%) was exclusively obtained upon exposure of 1 to PhMgBr at rt after 1 h. Under the limits of detection, not even traces of 2-phenylnaphthalene 10 were detected in the crude mixtures. Interestingly, however, statistical mixtures of 9:10 were found by addition of PhMgBr after exposure of 1 to 50 ºC for 6 h, thus confirming that ""ringwalking"" might constitute a new vehicle for enabling bond formation at distal C(sp 2 )-H bonds of aryl pivalates. An otherwise similar scenario was observed when conducting the Kumada-Corriu reaction of 3 and 5 (Scheme 7). While these results require stoichiometric amounts of Ni, our data should be assessed against the challenge that is addressed. Indeed, our protocol represents the first time that distal C(sp 2 )-H functionalizations can be enabled by ""ring-walking"" aided by Ni complexes, thus paving the way for designing future Ni-catalyzed endeavors triggered by a dynamic translocation of the metal center throughout the arene backbone. a ipso-Functionalization: 1, 3 or 5 (0.01-0.03 mmol), PhMgBr (1 equiv) in C6D6 (0.06 M), rt, 1 h.

GC yields using n-decane as an internal standard (10, 11a-c) or F NMR yields using (trifluoromethyl)benzene as internal standard.In summary, we have shown that Ni-Ni species can be utilized as a manifold for promoting a formal ""ring-walking"" events in aryl pivalates, thus establishing a new rationale for enabling C-C bond formation at distal', 'equilibrium at 1:1.7 ratio of 1:2 that could not be improved regardless of the temperature utilized due to the inherent instability of these complexes in solution. Notably, an otherwise identical 1:2 ratio was found by exposure of 2 after 6 h at 50 ºC. Intriguingly, an equimolar ratio of 3:4 was found when monitoring the isomerization of 3 at 50 ºC over 6 h, thus arguing against the positive impact that fluorine atoms might have in ringwalking for stabilizing adjacent s C(sp 2 )-metal bonds. While isomerization of analytically-pure 5 at 50 ºC revealed rapid formation of 5:6:7 in a 1:4.7:1.4 ratio after 4 h, it is worth mentioning that nickel translocation could also be enabled at room temperature leading to an otherwise identical ratio of 5:6:7 from either pure 5 after 6 days or from 6:7 mixtures (86:14) after 24 h (Scheme 5). Similarly, a deleterious effect was observed in the presence of external bases such as CsOPiv or Cs2CO3, 14 thus arguing against the intervention of concerted metalationdeprotonation pathways. Taken together, these observations reinforce the importance that the Ni-Ni dinuclear core might have in the targeted ""ring-walking"" event. Next, we decided to gather indirect evidence about the mechanism of the ring-walking by studying the behavior of 1-d2 (Scheme 6). As expected, 76% deuterium incorporation was observed at C1 in 2-d2. Notably, no ""ringwalking"" was observed with 8, hence reinforcing the notion that metal translocation might only be accomplished via 1,2-hydride shift. In addition, a primary kinetic isotope effect was observed when comparing the rates of 1 & 1-d2 (kH / kD = 2.2), suggesting that C(sp 2 )-H cleavage might be involved in the rate-determining step. Aiming at understanding the ""ring-walking"" of 1 and 2 at the molecular level, we turned our attention to DFT calculations [Gaussian 16, M06/def2-tzvpp//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) + SDD for Ni with toluene as solvent', 'systems -substrates particularly suited for Ni-catalyzed C-O functionalization -whereas 3-7 would provide an opportunity to extend the ""ring-walking"" event to non-pextended arenes. Moreover, 3 and 4 would allow to rationalize whether the nickel translocation might be affected by proximal fluorine atoms on electronic grounds 15 whereas the study of 5-7 could offer an opportunity to rationalize the extension at which ""ring-walking"" might occur at remote C(sp 2 )-H sites. The preparation of 3-7 is particularly noteworthy, representing the first examples of isolation of dinuclear oxidative addition species from non-p-extended aryl pivalates. While these complexes could unambiguously be characterized by NMR spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography of 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 univocally confirmed the interaction of the arene with the Ni-Ni core by both a s-bond and a h 2 -interaction. In line with these observations, 1-8 show a representative dp of 22.5-27.5 ppm with a Ni-Ni bond ranging from 2.3855(4)-2.433(3) Å. The dinuclear structure is completed by a bridging pivalate ligand having identical Ni-O bond distances. With a series of well-defined Ni-Ni complexes in hand, we turned our attention to study the viability for triggering a ""ring-walking"" throughout the arene backbone. We anticipated that the motion required for enabling a nickel translocation might be facilitated by a subtle temperature control or stereoelectronic effects. To this end, we monitored the stability of 1 at 50 ºC by 31 P{ 1 H}NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 4). A ratio of 1:2 (1:1.2 ratio) was observed after 6 h, thus confirming the viability for nickel translocation over a p-extended backbone.

The structural ensemble obtained from this step is later used as the reference to calculate S conf (0) (see Eq. 15).

In general, this partitioning allows systematic improvements of the scheme because the different contributions can in principle be calculated at any level of theory.If no low-lying conformers (relative energy <1-2 kcal/mol at ambient temperature) are found in the first step, the entropy run is not necessary and the plain S msRRHO value can be taken.

Copyright 2022, SciOpen.light, thereby making it a revolutionary technology due to its simplicity. In fact, photocatalytic water splitting is considered the ""holy grail"" reaction in physical chemistry, as it can directly generate H2 from water. This is a significant advantage, as it enables the production of a solar fuel without the need for external electricity, resulting in lower operating expenses (OPEX) costs.Photocatalysis by definition is a heterogeneous type of catalysis, requiring photons with adequate energy (see Figure ) to activate the solid semiconductor/catalyst and split', 'production of hydrogen could eliminate the need to use purified water, which can be expensive and energy-intensive to produce. Moreover, in the current scenario of water scarcity worldwide, purified water is a critical commodity: about one-in-four people (~2 billions) do not currently have access to clean, potable water. Unfortunately, this situation might worsen in the near future, due to the global warming and related climate change. Therefore, direct seawater splitting has the potential to be less reliant on centralized production facilities, making it a cheap, sustainable, and readily available option for de-centralized green hydrogen production. Cheap and Earth-abundant oxide-based semiconducting light absorbers could be pivotal for this technology: the main advantage of direct PC/PEC seawater splitting is that it does not require external sources of electricity to sustain the electrolysis, as schematically reported in Figure for a single junction device.Instead, the process is powered directly by sunlight, which is free, abundant (1.0 kW•m -2 at AM1.5), and renewable. In addition, due to the high concentration of NaCl in seawater (~0.5 mol•L -1 ) , this process could provide chlorine gas as a side (anodic) product, a commodity used to disinfect water, for the sanitation of sewage and industrial waste, and for production of derived chemicals and polymers. This side production could add a significant contribution to the value chain of hydrogen.The aforementioned green hydrogen production methods face the common challenge of high energy costs required to split water. According to thermodynamics, the energy input required for this reaction is equivalent to an applied voltage of 1.23 V. However, in practice, a voltage of more than 1.7 V must be applied to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),', 'H2 requires less theoretical electricity consumption, as previously reported and as schematized in Figure . Noteworthy, the theoretical operating voltage for a device performing biomass electrolysis could be as low as 0.5 V. From a PC/PEC point of view, this voltage could be achieved with the photovoltage generated by single junction photoabsorbers, as reported in Figure . This is a net advantage over water electrolysis, since the higher operating voltages required to split water necessitates multi-absorber tandems connected in series to yield additive photovoltages. Furthermore, biomass oxidation offers the opportunity to produce value-added chemicals, representing a highly efficient power-to-X (X = fuel and chemicals) conversion. These combined aspects have the potential to produce green hydrogen at relatively low cost, adding further value by the generation of diverse chemical commodities. ', '1.7 V must be applied to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the bottleneck of water splitting. Even the most efficient OER electrocatalysts to date show significant overpotentials (up to 0.4 V), which leads to a significant amount of energy being spent on producing oxygen, a product with low market value. As a result, the deployment of the green hydrogen production market is hindered: green hydrogen currently accounts for only 4% of the overall production worldwide, equivalent to 3.8 Mt in 2021. Interestingly, this is in line with the amount of electricity produced worldwide using solar PV, accounting for 3.6% (179 TWh in 2021). Therefore, boosting the largescale production of green hydrogen requires the parallel optimization and scale-up of both solar PV and electrolyzers. Value-added oxidation reactions are an attractive pathway to further reduce green hydrogen production costs by reducing energy consumption and adding market value. Biomass electrolysis offers a potential solution to replace the sluggish OER at the anodic side of (photo)electrolyzers with the more favorable organic molecule oxidation, which could lead to a more efficient production process. The hydrogen produced in this way is still considered ""green"" since biomass is recognized as a CO2-neutral, abundant, and renewable substitute for fossil fuels. Additionally, the rich proton content in most biomass building blocks makes it an effective H2 carrier. Compared to water electrolysis, the electrolysis of biomass feedstock to generate H2 requires less theoretical electricity consumption, as previously reported <ref type=""bibr""', 'current densities of about 20 mA cm -2 with minimal overvoltage losses, i.e. less than 0.3 V for extended periods of time (months or years), using cheap and earthabundant elements.

It is higher from the electronic gap by one quantum of vibration and corresponds to the period of 4 fs. Consistent with this selectivity, the Lagrange multipliers for the pair are again negligible. The vibrational selectivity is rather likely a reflection of the linearity in the nuclear dispacement of the coupling between the two electronic states. Indeed, the mean values for the population and coherence for this even smaller set of constraints is as accurate as the minimal set representation, see Fig. S7 in section S3.3 of the SM.

The operators diagonal in electronic state index have real-valued Lagrange multipliers. The superscripts on the Lagrange multipliers designate the two electronic states and the subscript is an index of the operator, see table I and S3.1 of the SM. In contrast to the closed algebra case, the Lagrange multiplier of the number operator is changing in time, and in opposite way for the ground and excited electronic states (black and green line, respectively). The off-diagonal in electronic state index number operator has a much smaller Lagrange multiplier that beats with the frequency of the energy gap between the two electronic states. As the two potentials are the same the gap does not depend on the nuclear coordinate, therefore there is only a constant beating frequency. These Lagrange multipliers are the same for the two initial states considered.! { } † † 2 † , ,The Lagrange multipliers are conjugate to the observables. This means that in principle they can be used to describe the state of the system in a manner complementary to that of the expectation values of the observables.

When the algebra is not closed we determine the time dependence of the Lagrange multipliers from the general result, Eq. ( ). Different approximations to the surprisal are then obtained depending on which operators are kept in the expansion . We show results for the smallest possible closed set of operators where already one obtains physically realistic results, the next larger algebra where the results are accurate to graph plotting accuracy and an even larger algebra where the convergence is rather acceptable.We examine the accuracy of the presented approach on the effects of the coherence between the vibrational and electronic states for two qualitatively different initial pure states:Î(t) = λ p (t) Bp p ∑ p l Bp Î(t) = λ p (t) Bp p ∑(a) a coherent superposition of a very few vibrational states with the main population in the state, and (b) a coherent superposition of a larger number of excited vibrational states centered about .

This represents the case when the algebra is not closed.Even so we can identify a few dominant constraints.

437,"Another novelty of our approach is the extrapolation of S conf to the ensemble completeness as discussed in section 3.1. The corresponding procedure requires systematically and smoothly improving CE quality in each iteration. In practice, the required number of iterations is very molecule specific but convergence is typically achieved within 5-15 iterations (see Fig. for some examples). The entropy difference between the last iteration and the extrapolated value is often relatively small but very significant for very flexible systems with huge ensembles. For example the CE of n-octadecane contains over half a million conformers within 6 kcal mol -1 at the last iteration. In a more typical case the entropy gain due to the extrapolation is smaller than one entropy unit (1 cal mol -1 K -1 ). Apixaban and Tamiflu depicted in Fig. are such examples, but nonetheless exhibit different convergence behavior. For small molecules the extrapolation is mostly not necessary because the entire ensemble will be found during the initial sampling procedure. From another viewpoint, the extrapolation scheme might rather be seen as a technical supplement for reduction of stochastical noise between the iterations and consquently, an improved prediction the final S conf value. Note, that 3 cal mol -1 K -1""entropy units"" refer to the usual 1 kcal mol -1 chemical accuracy at room temperature.Thus, with an accuracy for S better than about 1-2 cal mol -1 K -1 , the electronic energies of the molecules from DFT or wave function theory (WFT) become the accuracy bottleneck in typical thermochemical calculations.",Explanatory,What is often relatively small but very significant for very flexible systems with huge ensembles?,The entropy difference between the last iteration and the extrapolated value,Easy,['The entropy difference between the last iteration and the extrapolated value is often relatively small but very significant for very flexible systems with huge ensembles.'],"[[390, 560]]","['Extrapolation to ensemble completenessFor very flexible systems (e.g. long alkanes), the number of accessible conformers Ω is roughly proportional to Ω ≈ 3 R , where R is the number of freely rotatable bonds (commonly associated with the number of sp 3 -sp 3 carbon single bonds). In principle, all conformers, i.e., the complete ensemble and the respective energies are required for the calculation of S conf but even for only moderately sized systems this number is prohibitively huge.Practically, the obtained ensemble quality depends mostly on the run time t of the (biased) molecular dynamics (MD) in CREST. Basically, it is the number of optimized snap-shot structures gathered over all runs and will converge to a complete CE with the length of the conformational search. On the other hand, the conformational entropy also exhibits predictable behavior with regard to increasing ensemble completeness. If the lowest energy conformer is known, adding higher-lying conformers to the ensemble can only increase the entropy. If many of the low-energy structures are already found, the entropy increase for additional states is smooth and it seems possible to extrapolate to completeness without explicit knowledge of all conformers. The pre-requisite for this is the generation of enough intermediate points, i.e., consecutive conformational ensembles with systematically improved quality. A smooth and continuous convergence of the entropy to its maximum value can only be observed if conformers are added consistently from all regions of the PES (see Sec. 4.2 for examples).In the implementation of the algorithm, information from incomplete CEs of consecutive iterations is used for an extrapolation of the entropy according toS conf (x) -S conf (0) = p 1 (1 -exp (p 2 x p 3 )) , (15<formula', 'entropy S conf,est is determined. If no change (within a 2 % threshold) in S conf,est and the total number of unique conformers is observed, the final conformational entropy is calculated. Otherwise, a new iteration of 36 sMTDs is conducted using input structures and static bias structures determined from the updated ensemble. Furthermore, with each iteration the number of static bias structures is increased. This procedure is repeated until convergence is reached both with regards to S conf,est and the number of unique conformers in the ensemble. For the final calculation of S', 'cal mol -1 K -1 , respectively. Though decane (32 atoms) is smaller than the drug molecule tamiflu (50 atoms), their conformational entropy values are rather similar. The simple explanation for this is the higher flexiblity of decane, which is typically indicated by a larger relative contribution of S conf to the absolute entropy for similar sized structures. In general S conf will be close to zero for the most rigid molecules or molecules with only a few distinct conformers, but adds a significant portion (ten or more percent) to the absolute entropy for highly flexible molecules.The last contributrion to S conf is the population average S msRRHO . This term may provide insight about the variation of S msRRHO within the ensemble. It will be small if all contributing conformers have a similar ro-vibrational entropy as the reference structure (e.g. for decane with 0.7 cal mol -1 K -1 ), or yields a large contribution in the opposite case (tamiflu, 2.3 cal mol -1 K -1 ). For the latter, computed msRRHO entropies can vary by several entropy units for different conformations rather independently of the chosen τ or ν scal values. An example is provided in Fig. , where S msRRHO was calculated for 299 (random) conformers of tamiflu at two different theoretical levels (GFN-FF and B97-3c). Here, entropies at the GFN-FF level are overestimated by 4 cal mol -1 K -1 on average compared to the more accurate B97-3c level. Both methods show a similar spread of the S msRRHO values, which range approximately 6 cal mol -1 K -1 from lowest to highest value thus reassureing the use of S msRRHO . Hence, the validity of an approximate S msRRHO obtained at SQM or FF level depends on the performance for relative msRRHO entropies and may be used if a shifted (cf. Eq. 11) population average similar to the higher reference DFT level is expected. Another novelty of our approach is the extrapolation of S conf to the ensemble completeness as', 'General considerationsThe absolute entropy is a complicated property which includes various terms of different magnitude that can be qualitatively interpreted. As an example the suggested parti-tioning of the absolute entropy for two molecules is shown in Tab. 1. The largest portion have the same order of magnitude (about 30-40 cal mol -1 K -1 in Tab. 1) for all chemical systems of about this size (mass). In contrast, vibrational contributions quickly exceed several hundred cal mol -1 K -1 for molecules >100 atoms. In the important drug-size regime, the vibrational entropy is clearly the largest contribution and hence its accuracy depends also on how good anharmonicities are described. As defined in Sec. 2, the effect of anharmonicities can be estimated from the difference between the entropy calculated by the new msRRHO and standard RRHO scheme (i.e., without modifying τ and frequency scaling). Looking at the two example molecules, decane shows only a relatively small RRHO-msRRHO difference of 0.9 cal mol -1 K -1 while tamiflu exhibits a much higher anharmonic contribution of 4.4 cal mol -1 K -1 . This is in line with chemical intuition, as one would expect many more anharmonic ro-vibrational modes for a complicated drug molecule like tamiflu than for a rather simple linear structure composed of only CH and CC bonds. In any case, the anharmonicity is non-negligible and must be accounted for by either τ and ν scal or some more elaborate, explicit scheme. With increasing flexibility of the molecule the configurational contribution increases drastically and in fact, S conf can be taken as a molecular flexibility measure (see Sec. 4.4).For decane and tamiflu the conformational entropy S conf accounts for 12.5 and 13.7 cal mol -1 K -1 , respectively. Though decane (32 atoms) is smaller than the drug molecule tamiflu', 'entropy, e.g., based only on the number of conformers N conf according to S conf ≈ R ln (N conf ). This approximation is used in some studies and is appealing due to its simplicity. However, while this formulation may be used for very simple molecules, it breaks down for more complex PES. Further discussion of this point is given in the Supporting Information.The sum in Eq. 8 is taken over all significantly populated, distinguishable structures representing a so-called generalized Boltzmann distribution. The problem of this procedure (also termed Gibbs-Shannon entropy based procedure) is that not only an almost complete conformer ensemble has to be found but additionally, it should be ""pure"", i.e., free of socalled rotamers. In this case for molecules with non-degenerate electronic ground states, all g i are unity. Rotamers are structures indistinguishable by any nuclear spin-independent quantum mechanical observable. They arise from rotation around covalent chemical bonds (or other inversion-type processes) that interchange nuclei belonging to the same group of nuclides, as for example the interchange of protons at a methyl group by rotation.In this work, we propose and implement for the first time an automatic algorithm that generates a theoretically proper ensemble of unique conformer structures required for the accurate computation of S conf . For the conformer search problem, we employ our recently described CREST program (abbreviated from Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool), which is based on metadynamics simulations employing on-the-fly computed quantum mechanical tight-binding PES.

Since the major percentage of the SFC mobile phase consists of CO2 in the sub-or-super-critical state, the high diffusivity and low viscosity of such mobile phase enable SFC to be operated under higher optimum linear velocity than HPLC, making the chromatography very fast.Moreover, unlike HPLC, the density of the super/sub-critical mobile phase can be easily manipulated by changing its pressure and temperature, which consequently dictates its solvating power (i.e., a mobile phase with high density implies better solvating capacity). For example, when the backpressure of an SFC system is increased and the thermostat temperature is decreased, the density of the mobile phase increases, and so does the dissolution ability or the solvating power of the mobile phase. Such phenomenon of the mobile phase provides flexibility to the SFC users to further adjust various chromatographic parameters such as selectivity and retention of the solutes.

However, one major setback of the OLED technology is that the devices are very sensitive to the impurities present in the OLED materials, impacting device lifetime, stability, and overall performance. The isolation of large quantities of the main OLED components from the synthetic impurities is challenging using the traditional purification process (i.e., train sublimation), which has poor reproducibility, and high capital and operating cost. Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) could lend itself as an alternative technique for the profiling of impurities and their purification.

However, since this state behaves spectroscopically the same as free triplets, for simplicity we refer to it as the T 1 state.The TA spectra of dilute and concentrated TIPS-Tn exhibit differences that are similar to those in TIPS-Pn. Figure (a) shows that for the 0.05 mM sample there is a GSB at 537 nm, a SE signal at 584 nm, and ESA over the full visible range, with the most prominent peak at 477 nm.These signals are consistent with those of TIPS-Tn S 1 excitons measured previously. As with TIPS-Pn,', 'IV. CONCLUSIONSUsing transient absorption spectroscopy of 0.05 mM and 8 mM solutions of TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn in toluene, we have quantified an upper bound on the rate constant (lower bound on the time constant) of intersystem crossing (ISC) in these solutions as 3.08 × 10 6 s -1 (325 ns) and 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 (118 ns), respectively. Taking the ISC rate constants into account, we were also able to quantify the bimolecular singlet fission (SF) rate constants in these solutions as (2.6 ± 0.7) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 for TIPS-Pn, and (2.3 ± 0.9) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 for TIPS-Tn, where the range of values comes from the uncertainty in the ISC rate constant and in the T 1 basis spectra. We have pointed out some discrepancies in the literature, and shown that ISC can be overestimated by disregarding diffusion-limited SF in dilute solutions. Alternatively, SF can also be overestimated by not appropriately considering T 1 contributions from ISC. For systems in which SF is relatively slow, or is limited by diffusion through solution or exciton diffusion through a disordered material, the effect of ISC is particularly important. To make progress in the implementation of SF in photovoltaic devices (or in fact in other applications, such as quantum computing), it is important to accurately identify and quantify SF rate constants and yields, which would be impossible in many circumstances if ISC is not also considered.FIG. 1 .1FIG. 1.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODSTIPS-Pn (Ossila) and TIPS-Tn (Lumtec) were used as received. 8 mM and 0.05 mM solutions of each were prepared in anhydrous toluene (Sigma-Aldrich) in a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere. The O 2 content was kept below 0.5 ppm. Steady-state absorbance spectra were recorded on a Cary Varian 1E UV-visible spectrophotometer (supplementary material Sec. 2). The pathlength used for spectroscopic measurements was 0.03 mm for the 8 mM samples and 2 mm for the 0.05 mM samples. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted on a home-built instrument, using the 1030 nm output of a pulsed laser operating at a 5 kHz repetition rate (Light Conversion, Pharos). A portion of the output was doubled to 515 nm and introduced to a home-made optical parametric amplifier to obtain 810 nm, which was doubled to a 405 nm pump beam. The probe was a white light continuum obtained by focusing a portion of the 1030 nm output onto a 1 cm pathlength cuvette of D 2 O. The white light continuum was then focused onto the sample with a 0.2 mm spot size, and detected with a spectrograph (Oriel, 77400) and camera (Andor, Zyla 5.5 sCMOS). Experiments were performed with the pump polarization rotated to the magic angle (54.7 • ) relative to the probe. Data were taken at pump powers of 3.8 mW (0.76 µJ) and 2 mW (0.4 µJ), for which no power dependence was observed. Photo-degradation was observed to be less than 10% after each experiment. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION', 'excitons measured previously. As with TIPS-Pn, the averaged and normalized 0.05 mM TA data show minimal shape change over 8 ns (Fig. )), indicating that this spectrum predominantly contains singlet excitons, with minimal SF, ISC, or excimer formation. The decay of the spectrum fits well to a single exponential with a 12.7 ± 0.2 ns time constant (Sec. S5.1 of the supplementary material). This time constant is reasonably consistent with the 13.2 ns singlet lifetime of TIPS-Tn in anhydrous toluene previously reported by and the 11.6 ns lifetime in chloroform reported by In contrast, the 8 mM TIPS-Tn TA spectrum shows some shape change over time (Fig. ).The difference is less prominent than for TIPS-Pn, but there is a clear emergence of a peak at ∼510 nm, concurrent with decreases in the amplitudes of S 1 features (relative to the GSB). We assign this peak to the absorbance of TIPS-Tn triplet excitons, consistent with the visible T 1 absorbance of other tetracene derivatives. Again, since no significant triplet formation was observed in the dilute TIPS-Tn solution, this triplet formation in the more concentrated solution must be due to SF.', 'FIG. 2 .2FIG. 2.

The temperature in the inset of Fig. (a) increases over time, showing that the QM/MM artificial heating due to transition forces is much worse than that of MM/MM comparing with Fig. .

The black box nature of the machine-learning potential makes it difficult to estimate the accuracy in cases beyond its training set.

Direct experimental measurements of the DD generation have been difficult due to the small spatial and temporal scales, and much effort has been devoted to simulation studies. A large number of atoms are needed for simulating the DD generation, since its collision cascades may span several nanometers. The number of atoms exceeds the ability of highly accurate ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) methods such as the density functional theory (DFT).

This data confirmed the presumed structures in all cases: in each of the four structures the hypercoordinate silicon core adopts an octahedral structure with the two silyloxy ligands observed in a trans (diaxial) arrangement (Figure ). The asymmetric unit in 1i contains two molecules, each in a different conformational pose (1i′ and 1i′′).Of the four compounds we examined (seen in Table ), all deviated from planarity. Compound 1g is the most planar molecule with two meso carbon atoms located trans to each other displaced above and below the plane by ±0.011 Å. This is the most planar porphyrin silane crystal structure reported to date. The meso carbons in 1h and in both poses of 1i were each out of plane, though only slightly (≤0.152 Å), and porphyrins maintained overall symmetry around the central silicon. Unique amongst the studied set, compound 1f displayed the least planar structure and was surprisingly devoid of symmetry around the central silicon atom. In general, we were gratified to see that modification of the easily incorporated axial silyloxy substituents can control the degree to which the porphyrin deviates from planarity in the crystal structure. This demonstrates that axial substitution is a powerful tool for control of solid-state porphyrin conformation.In terms of electronics, the iterative replacement of methyl for phenyl groups on the silyloxy cap (1f to 1g to 1i) should increase the electron density on the silane allowing for lengthening of the O1-Si2/O2-Si3 bond (Figure ); the excess electron density on the oxygen could translate to a shorter Si1-O distances and allow the Si-N bonds to lengthen to accommodate the preferred return to planarity of the ring.

No such effect is observed. From a steric perspective, the Si1-O-Si bond angle of the least planar porphyrin (1f) is the most acute so one might think the steric interaction is influencing ring structure, however i) this is also the smallest of the studied substituents and arranged in the sterically least impacting way in the solid state (with the phenyl pointing away from the porphyrin) and ii) there is no general correlation between that bond angle and planarity in the studied compounds.There does appear to be a correlation between axial silyloxy substituent size and Si1-O-Si angle, tending towards linear as the cap size increases in this set. The SOPS bearing the largest substituent (OSi t BuPh2, 1h) displays a remarkably wide bond angle of 168°. The Si1-O bond length also varies based on the silyl cap, though no clear trend is observed. While shorter Si1-O bond distances would be expected in the more planar SOPS, there is a complex interplay amongst these derivatives with respect to the steric and electronic demands of the silyloxy cap substituents. From this perspective the Me2Ph derivative (1f) is unique amongst PorSils that have been examined by X-ray crystallography: it has an Si-X bond distance similar to that of a tetracoordinate silane, yet the porphyrin in the crystal structure is still highly ruffled. The other derivatives seem to fit into the construct derived from previous studies of porphyrin silanes (as discussed above).One last interesting note is that while the silyloxy substituents in 1g, 1h, and 1i are arranged in an anti configuration with respect to the Si-O(-Si1-)O-Si bond, the highly ruffled 1f has a Si-O(-Si1-)O-Si dihedral angle of 86.72°.

While the proton resonance for HB appears at approximately 8.1-8.2 ppm (Figure ) in the spectra of 2 and alkyl capped derivatives 1a-e, it is shifted upfield to 7.4-8.0 ppm for 1f-i. We attribute this effect to through-space interactions between HB and the aromatic ring(s) of the capping groups in 1f-i; such interactions are also observed in the solid state (see Supporting Information, Figures ). All NMR spectra acquired at ambient temperature were well-resolved; this evidence of rapid conformational sampling suggests that these intramolecular contacts do not restrict bond rotation. There is, however, a distinct broadening of the aromatic peaks of the silyloxy cap in 1f at low temperatures, indicating anisotropy due to slow conformational sampling. We were unable to reach a temperature low enough to sufficiently slow the rate of interconversion such that two distinct species could be detected (see Supporting Information, Figure ).Impact of Axial Substitution on Porphyrin Planarity. Por-Sils have previously been observed to have distortion in the planarity of the ring system in the solid state, which is due to the small size of silicon relative to the porphyrin cavity size. In these instances, the porphyrin core slightly contracts to allow for sufficient orbital overlap between the pyrrole nitrogen atoms and the electron-deficient silicon atom. These non-planar porphyrins can adopt a variety of conformations, including ruffled and', ' can adopt a variety of conformations, including ruffled and waved, which each have characteristic patterns of displacement. Of the 10 previously reported porphyrin silane crystal structures, four were close to planar (∆r < 0.15 Å: TPP-Si(OH)2 TPP-Si(CH2TMS)2, TPP-Si(CHCH2)2, and TPP-Si(CCPh)2 ) and six were clearly non-planar (∆r>>0.15 Å: [TPP-Si(THF)2] 2+ •2Cl -, 29 TPP-SiOTf2, TPP-SiMePh, TPP-SiPh2, tetrakis(p-tolyl)porphyrin-SiF2, and tetrakis(p-trifluoromethylphenyl)porphyrin-SiF2 31 ).From this set it seems as though planarity can be achieved if both i) the axial substituents are sufficiently small so as to not abut the porphyrin and ii) the axial ligand is capable of π-backbonding to provide the silicon with extra electron density and allow Si-N bonds to lengthen to planarity. For example, while a fluorine atom is certainly small, it does not effectively provide electron density to the silicon via unshared electrons. On the other hand, the phenyl substituents can more readily π-backbond to the silicon, however the ortho hydrogens have a deleterious steric interaction with the macrocyclic ring, preventing porphyrin planarization. This theory is also supported by the observed Si-N and Si-X (X = first atom of axial substituent) bond lengths: planar PorSils feature longer Si-N bonds compared to non-planar structures and the Si-X bond lengths are similar to those in tetracoordinate silanes as opposed to the elongated bonds expected in a hexacoordinate silane.

The HOMO→LUMO dipole transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and therefore the LUMO energy does not control the optical band gap. (It should be noted that the HOMO→LUMO transition might still be responsible for a very weak signal at about 1.8 eV as shown in Figure in the SI, which is neglected for the following calculations.) For pyrene, the HOMO→LUMO transition is allowed and determines the optical band gap. If the difference between the optical band gap and the electronic band gap is to be calculated in a meaningful manner using electronic ""frozen orbital"" transition energies, the LUMO has to be excluded for azupyrene. Accordingly, the DFT-calculated electronic band gap of azupyrene increases from 2.96 eV to 3.62 eV. With this value the difference between the DFT-based ""frozen orbital"" electronic band gap and the (experimental) optical band gap is 1.08 eV (= 3.62 eV -2.54 eV) for azupyrene, while the same difference is only 0.20 eV (= 3.83 eV -3.63 eV) for pyrene. The large deviation between the electronic and optical band gap for azupyrene is a direct consequence of its nonalternant -electron system. This topological property of azupyrene leads to a localization of the molecular orbitals.

The flexibility in the desired properties has previously been achieved by variation of substituents at the periphery of the pyrene backbone. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the central \uf070-electron system on the relevant properties such as the band gap or the fluorescence behavior has not yet been addressed. In this work, pyrene is compared with its structural isomer azupyrene, which has a \uf070-electron system with nonalternant topology. Using photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and other methods, it is shown that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of pyrene. The difference of the optical band gaps is even larger with 1.09 eV, as determined by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. The nonalternant nature of azupyrene is also associated with a more localized charge distribution, as can be seen in 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance shifts, as well as the C1s core-level shifts. Further insight is provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the molecular properties and ab initio coupled cluster calculations of the optical transitions. The concept of aromaticity is used to interpret DFT-based structures and for the theoretical assignment of the vibrational modes of the infrared spectra, where major topology-related differences are apparent.', 'Analysis of the Valence Electronic StructureAzupyrene with its nonalternant \uf070-electron system has a much smaller optical gap than its alternant isomer pyrene. This is apparent in the intense yellow color displayed by solutions of azupyrene, whereas solutions of pyrene are colorless (See insets in Figure ). In agreement with the yellow color of azupyrene, the UV/Vis spectrum (Figure ) shows an absorption peak for azupyrene at a photon energy of 2.6 eV, in the blue part of the visible range. Pyrene has its lowest energy peak at a much higher photon energy of 3.7 eV, well outside the visible range. The resulting optical excitation energies, determined from the rising edge of the peak, are 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding a difference of 1.09 eV. Our ab initio calculations within the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) approach (see vertical lines in Figure ) overestimate the absolute excitation energies for both molecules. However, the calculations yield a difference in transition energies of 1.10 eV between azupyrene and pyrene, in excellent agreement with the experiment. It should be noted that while the lowest energy excitation corresponds to the transition from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO→LUMO) in pyrene, this transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and the peak in the visible range has to be attributed to the transition into a higher lying unoccupied orbital (HOMO→LUMO+1). The calculated data for the UPS and NEXAFS spectra was rigidly shifted to match the experimental energy scale. The calculated NEXAFS transitions have already been published in context of method development.

The first \uf070* resonance of pyrene has two maxima, which are caused by the C1s→LUMO and C1s→LUMO+1 excitations, as was ascertained by MO-projected NEXAFS simulations (see Figure in the SI and Ref. ). For azupyrene, the individual excitations in the first peak are not resolved, because the corresponding LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals are too close in energy. For both molecules, the MO-projected NEXAFS simulations show that the leading edge of the adsorption peak is determined by the C1s→LUMO excitation.The X-ray absorption edge of azupyrene appears at a lower photon energy by 0.37 eV than that of pyrene, as can be seen in Figure . Since the core-level energies differ only marginally, it can therefore be concluded that the LUMO of azupyrene is lower in energy. Theory also predicts the LUMO of azupyrene to be lower in energy, here the magnitude is 0.60 eV.Combination of the experimental differences of electron addition and removal energies from UPS and NEXAFS data indicate that the electronic band gap is 0.72 eV (= 0.37 eV + 0.35 eV) smaller for azupyrene than for pyrene. For comparison, the calculations yield a value of 0.87 eV for the difference in electronic band gap, which is in good agreement with the experimental finding. In addition, the calculations can provide the absolute electronic band gaps, which are not accessible by the experimental techniques at our disposal. The calculated absolute electronic band gaps are 2.96 eV and 3.83 eV for azupyrene and pyrene, respectively. These values can be compared to the optical band gaps of 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, as determined by UV/Vis,', ""the valence electronic structure in applicationrelated polycrystalline thin films of pyrene and azupyrene. The thereby obtained electronic band gaps are compared with the optical band gaps, as determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy. We use complementary quantum theoretical calculations on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) and the coupled cluster (CC) approximation to gain a deeper understanding of the electronic structure and observed optical and electronic transitions in UV/Vis as well as in fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, we discuss the results of NMR and IR spectroscopy together with an analysis according to the HOMA approach.The theoretical methods were always employed on the gas-phase molecules to have the same reference for experiments performed on thin films and on solutions of the molecules. The gas phase calculations additionally offer a more accessible interpretation using the molecular electronic states. However, we performed additional calculations for the molecular crystals with periodic boundary conditions to gauge the influence of intermolecular interactions, which are present in the experiments involving thin films, on the electronic properties.Our study reveals and illustrates the striking influence of the \uf070-electron system's topology on the electronic properties. The nonalternant molecule shows significantly lower electronic and optical band gaps and we found strong indications for lower electron-hole binding energies, which can facilitate electron-hole separation. Applying these results in the form of topological design to the development of new materials for organic electronic devices can open up a new pathway for tuning their properties in a systematic manner. Only in the case of pyrene can the atoms be alternatingly labelled (red/green), while this is not possible for azupyrene."", 'was already used to explain the color of the prototypical nonalternant molecule azulene. The spatial separation of the excited electron from its orbital of origin (the hole left behind upon excitation) suggests a small electron-hole binding energy in azupyrene. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that electron and hole, i.e., positive and negative charge carriers, can more easily be separated in azupyrene-based than in pyrene-based organic electronics devices.For illustration, the frontier orbitals of azupyrene are shown in Figure : the HOMO is partly localized at the tip-atoms of the 7-membered rings and has vanishing coefficients at the neighboring atoms and the central C2-unit, whereas the LUMO+1 shows a reversed localization with a nodal plane running through the tip atoms of the 7-membered ring (see Figure , left). In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO of pyrene are linked by the Coulson-Rushbrooke pairing theorem and thus are localized on the same carbon atoms (see Figure , right). Thus, the lower band gap of azupyrene is caused by its nonalternant nature in two ways: (i) the ""frozen orbital"" electronic band gap is smaller, because the HOMO is higher in energy and the LUMO is lower in energy and (ii) the reduced electron-electron repulsion in the excited state leads to an even smaller optical band gap.The fact that the HOMO→LUMO transition is forbidden for azupyrene has further consequences for its fluorescence spectrum. Indeed, no substantial fluorescence could be detected for azupyrene (see Figure of the SI). Adhering to Kasha\'s rule, the azupyrene molecule would relax non-radiatively to the lowest excited singlet state S1, where one electron resides in the former LUMO.

Depending on the enzyme for the treatment the degradation products were dipeptides or tripeptides, all of which have no antibacterial activity (Fig ). ε-Poly-L-lysine as a FDA approved antibacterial food additive showed slightly better antibacterial activity than K18S4, but slower bacteria-killing (Fig ). Although ε-Poly-L-lysine was degradable by specific enzymes produced by few specific types of microorganisms , it was highly stable in the presence of many common enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, and maintained the original antibacterial activity after treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin (Fig ). Therefore, ε-Poly-L-lysine is not a suitable antibiotic substitute in aquaculture. After S. aureus was incubated with Dye-K18S4 and propidium iodide (PI, red fluorescence) for around 450s, a small amount of Dye-K18S4 began to accumulate in the cytoplasm without enrichment on the cell membrane beforehand (Fig ). At about 1260s, a burst of Dye-K18S4 and PI into the cytoplasm indicated critical damages on the cell membrane of S. aureus (Fig 4a ). The observed membrane damage was at the late stage of the bacteria-polymer interaction when S. aureus was killed by the peptide polymer. Since the Dye-K18S4 was not enriched on the cell membrane, the membrane damage may not be caused by Dye-K18S4 directly from the outside of the bacteria. Fluorescence intensity analysis across S. aureus cells, at 120s and 1500s after incubation, echoed above observation that Dye-K18S4 did not enrich either on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm at an early stage, but enriched inside the cell at a late stage (Figure <ref",Causal,Why does ε-Poly-L-lysine maintain its original antibacterial activity even after treatment with enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin?,"ε-Poly-L-lysine maintains its original antibacterial activity after treatment with enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin because it is highly stable in the presence of these common enzymes, showing resistance to degradation.",Medium,"['Although ε-Poly-L-lysine was degradable by specific enzymes produced by few specific types of microorganisms, it was highly stable in the presence of many common enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, and maintained the original antibacterial activity after treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin.']","[[387, 696]]","['). A further time-killing kinetics study on K18S4 against Grampositive bacteria S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and V. anguillarum (a representative of the common pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture) revealed a quick killing of bacteria at 2×MIC concentration of K18S4, such as the complete killing of V. anguillarum within 30 minutes (Fig ). The bacteria-killing of K18S4 was much faster than that of conventional antibiotic thiamphenicol, indicating advantages of K18S4 in treating aquacultureencountered bacterial infections.To examine if bacteria can develop resistance to the peptide polymers, we treated Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli with K18S4 at 0.5×MBC concentration continuously, and found that none of the bacteria developed resistance against K18S4 even after continuous treatment for 888 and 1152 generations of S. aureus and Even if an antibacterial agent, such as K18S4, shows low tendency to induce antimicrobial resistance, full degradability is still highly desired for antibiotic substitutes in aquaculture. The massive use and subsequent discharge of the antimicrobial agents to the environment may cause antimicrobial selective pressure and disruption of balance of the complicated microbial system in the environment, which is a big concern in massive use of antibiotics in aquaculture. Therefore, an ideal substitution of antibiotics in aquaculture should be fully degradable to individual residues and thus lose antibacterial activity completely after degradation. K18S4 was completely degraded within 6 hours in the presence of protease type XXIII from Aspergillus oryzae, as confirmed by NMR analysis on the disappearance of the characteristic peaks for α-CH group on the peptide backbone at In addition to enzymes produced by microorganisms, K18S4 can also be degraded by trypsin and chymotrypsin that are widely distributed in the digestive tract. Depending on', 'or in the cytoplasm at an early stage, but enriched inside the cell at a late stage (Figure ). Interestingly, incubation of E. coli and V. anguillurm with Dye-K18S4 and PI both led to immediate enrichment of Dye-K18S4 on the cell membrane, and then obvious enrichment of Dye-K18S4 and PI into the bacteria after incubation for a longer time (Fig 4d ). Fluorescence intensity analysis across E. coli and V. anguillurm, both echoed the two stages that Dye-K18S4 firstly accumulated on the cell membrane of E. coli and V. anguillurm, and then entered the cells (Fig ). In further outer membrane permeability assays at the early stage of bacteria-polymer interaction, K18S4 was found to cause significant permeability changes to the outer membranes of E. coli and V. anguillurm, similar to polymyxin B (Fig 5a ). Adding exogenous LPS, a main component of the outer membrane, to K18S4 showed a LPS dose-dependent antibacterial activity against E. coli and V. anguillurm (Fig ). These results are consistent to aforementioned observation of K18S4 enrichment on the outer membrane of E. coli and V. anguillurm (Fig 4d ). Therefore, the antibacterial mechanism of K18S4 against Gram-negative E. coli and V. anguillurm may be explained by the strong interaction on cell membrane. Interestingly, K18S4 only caused mild depolarization on cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-positive S. aureus (Fig ) at the early stage of bacteria-polymer interaction, which may not be enough to pose an adequate threat.

K18S4 displayed potent activities against all these pathogens with MIC in the range of 3.13-25 μg/mL; K18S4 was also bactericidal with minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) identical to its MIC for most bacteria. The overall antibacterial activity of K18S4 was superior to thiamphenicol and sulfadimethoxine, especially for MBC. We also examined the activity of K18S4 against fungi, though fungi are not major pathogens in aquaculture. K18S4 displayed potent activity against C. neoformans (MIC=1.56-3.13 μg/mL for all three strains) comparable to amphotericin B, but no obvious activity against C. albicans at a concentration up to 200 μg/mL (Table ). In the acute toxicity test on adult zebrafish, the LC50 (the median lethal concentration) value of K18S4 was 98.14 μg/mL (Fig 3b, Table ), which was much higher than the MIC and MBC values of K18S4 and indicated selective antibacterial properties of K18S4. Compared with α-Poly-L-lysine (LC50 of K21: 19.61 μg/mL), the acute toxicity of K18S4 to adult zebrafish was also significantly reduced (Table ).

Peptide polymers K18S4, K16S6 and K13S8 all displayed low cytotoxicity against mammalian cells even at a peptide polymer concentration of 200 μg/mL, using COS-7 as a model (Fig ).

Altogether, although K18S4 has a certain interaction with the cell membranes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial mechanisms of K18S4 against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are different. We speculate that K18S4 has a mild interaction with the bacterial membrane at the early stage of bacteria-polymer interaction during K18S4 entering S. aureus; then membrane depolarization and subsequent strong interaction between K18S4 and DNA induce an increase in intracellular ROS level, which cause the peroxidation of cell membrane and ultimately destruction of the bacterial membrane. For Gram-negative bacteria, we speculate that K18S4 first binds with LPS to change the permeability of the outer membrane, and could stick between the outer membrane and the inner membrane before K18S4 disrupts the bacterial membrane, similar to precedent reports on antibacterial peptides and their mimics . Finally, the bacterial membrane is destroyed by the strong interaction between K18S4 and bacterial membrane, resulting in death of Gram-negative bacteria. Encouraged by the potent and broad-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activity of K18S4, we continued to evaluate the therapeutic potential of K18S4 in vivo using an adult zebrafish infection model.

394,"target=""#b39"">39 Assuming all non-secular terms are negligible the strength of the dipolar coupling is given by 𝜔 BB = 𝜔 C (3 cos $ 𝜃 -1), where 𝜃 is the angle between the inter-spin vector and the external magnetic field and 𝜔 C is the coupling frequency when 𝜃 = 90°. While each orientation of the molecule is equally likely to be present in the sample, leading to a Pake pattern of inter-spin coupling frequencies, the orientations do not contribute equally to the recorded data due to the inherent orientation selectivity of microwave pulses (Figure ). As such we can generate two models of dipolar coupling: one with uniform weights representing the sample as a whole, and one in which each orientation is weighted by the overlap of the nitroxide spectrum with the microwave pulses. The simulated fidelities of the entangling gate with 𝜔 C = 2 MHz for the uniform and weighted models are 0.749 and 0.821, respectively, significantly lower than the corresponding simulations considering an isotropic interaction. This decrease in fidelity is caused by interference between systems with different coupling frequencies, which diminishes the expectation values of the anti-phase coherences. The uniformly weighted simulation is more impacted by this interference as its frequency distribution is a complete Pake pattern, whereas the frequency distribution of the spectrally weighted simulation corresponds to a partial Pake pattern.In addition to the orientational disorder, molecules in frozen solution will adopt different conformations with different inter-spin distances. As a result there will be a distribution in 𝜔 C which will further broaden the inter-spin coupling distribution. Here we take 𝜔 C to be normally distributed with mean 𝜇 + ' and standard deviation 𝜎 + ' . As expected, as 𝜎 + ' is increased the fidelity of both models decreases (Figure ).

However, it is clear by visual inspection that the majority of the experimental time traces are not completely flat and thus contain some form of oscillation, and that the amplitude of these oscillations is significantly lower than in the reference DEER data (DEERATom data Figures S7-S9, DEER data Figure ).The state of the system was determined by globally fitting the data for a range of values of 𝑃 =>?6 , with the lowest cost solution occurring at 𝑃 =>?6 = 0.42. The pseudo-fidelity of the entanglement and tomography combined can be calculated by comparing the deviation density matrices, which we accomplish by treating the expectation values of the non-identity Cartesian product operators as vectors in the generalised Bloch sphere. In this representation the similarity between two states can be thought of as the angle between them, and we use the cosine of this angle to define the pseudo-fidelity:ℱ _ (𝜌 > "" , 𝜌 > $ ) = 𝑑 -1 2𝑑 cos∠(𝜌 > "" , 𝜌 > $ ) + 𝑑 + 1 2𝑑where 𝑑 is the Hilbert dimension, and:cos∠(𝜌 > "" , 𝜌 > $ ) = 𝜌 ⃗ "" ⋅ 𝜌 ⃗ $ = e 𝛼 @ 𝛽 @ A @ = tr(𝜌 > "" 𝜌 > $ ) - 1 𝑑where 𝜌 ⃗ is the vector representation of 𝜌 >, and 𝛼 and 𝛽 are the expectation values of the basis operators in 𝜌 > "" and 𝜌 > $ , respectively (i.e. the elements of 𝜌 ⃗ "" and 𝜌 ⃗ $ ).

All simulations were performed using the Matlab toolbox Easyspin. If the pulses used were capable of exciting all electron spins within these nuclear spin manifolds, then one third of the spin centres would be detected as the three nuclear spin states are approximately equally populated. Of these detected spins, the pump pulse would invert one third of their coupled partners, and so one ninth of the molecules in the sample would contribute an oscillatory component to the recorded trace. In reality the pulses only excite a fraction of the spins in each manifold, and so the inter-spin interactions recorded represent an even smaller proportion of molecules corresponding to specific orientations of the nitroxide spin centres with respect to the external magnetic field (Figure ). The background corrected results of the 3P-DEER experiment detected at 𝜈 ) and 𝜈 * are almost identical (Figure , raw data in Figure ), and from these it can be determined that the twoqubit gate time, i.e. the first minimum in the time trace, is 250 ns. Despite being in frozen solution, compound 1 exhibits a narrow distribution of coupling frequencies centred at 2 MHz (Figure , right). This likely a result of the rigidity of the alkyne and phenyl groups', 'Coupling Frequency DistributionIn frozen-solution samples each molecule will have a different alignment with respect to the external magnetic field and a unique molecular conformation, leading to a distribution of coupling frequencies across the ensemble. As a result, the coherences generated by the DFHE entangling gate with a specific value of 𝜏 will represent the average over a distribution of coupling frequencies. The simplest model of inter-spin coupling is that of an isotropic interaction, corresponding to physical systems in which the inter-spin coupling is dominated by super-exchange interactions, or equivalently those in which only specific orientations of the molecule with respect to the external magnetic field are sampled. The coupling distribution was modelled as a normal distribution centred at 𝜇 + !"" = 2 MHz, corresponding to the maximum of the inter-spin coupling in compound 1, with standard deviations 𝜎 + !"" . As expected, first maximum in the simulated fidelity decreases as the distribution of inter-spin couplings is broadened (Figure ). Through the DEER experiment, we can estimate the distribution of couplings exhibited by the sub-population probed by our experiments; the standard deviation of the inter-spin coupling was determined to be approximately 0.244 MHz (Figure , Table ), corresponding to a fidelity of 0.989. For the coupling between two spins to be detectable by pulse dipolar spectroscopy, the interspin distance must be greater than around 1.5 nm. In this distance regime isotropic exchange coupling tends to be negligible, and the inter-spin interaction is generally dominated by the anisotropic dipolar interaction. Assuming all non-secular terms are negligible the strength of the', 'right). This likely a result of the rigidity of the alkyne and phenyl groups connecting the two nitroxide spins, which will limit the distribution of conformations adopted in solution.The observed coupling distribution is likely further narrowed by the pulses used only exciting certain orientations of the nitroxide spin centre, and so not all orientations of the inter-spin vector will contribute to the oscillations (Figure ). While the distribution of inter-spin interactions could be reduced further by orienting the sample, we find that the coupling frequency is well enough defined in frozen solution to demonstrate a proof-of-principle entangling gate. The coherence times were measured by 2P-Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (2P-ESEEM) (Figure ) and the fitted value of 6.89 μs is significantly longer than the two-qubit gate time, which is itself significantly longer than the one-qubit gate time. This relationship between operation times make compound 1 a suitable candidate for the generation and detection of entanglement via free evolution under the inter-qubit coupling. ', 'Relation to ExperimentThe simulations presented thus far have considered the absolute quantum state of the system at the end of the relevant process normalised relative to the initial state . It is not possible to normalise the experimentally determined quantum state in this way as the initial state is not determined. Instead, the fitted state was normalised by the magnitude of the calculated expectation values, and so is insensitive to an overall loss in magnetisation. This relative normalisation process can dramatically increase the experimental fidelity, especially for the simulations of the entangling gate considering anisotropic coupling frequencies. The uniformly and orientationally weighted simulations with 𝜔 C = 2 MHz have simulated pseudofidelities of just 0.746 and 0.820, but normalised pseudo-fidelities of 0.963 and 0.927.such we consider it more feasible to reduce the spread of couplings by orienting the ensemble, either in a single-or liquid-crystal.Orienting the sample would also narrow the spectra of anisotropic spin systems as angular distributions of spin Hamiltonian parameters will also be reduced to a single value. The oriented spectrum will still be broadened by couplings to neighbouring electron and nuclear spins, as well as the presence of different molecular conformations which will introduce distributions in 𝑔-values, hyperfine couplings, and zero-field splitting parameters where relevant. As such, it is likely that the reduction of partial excitation of near resonant spin packets will require both orientation of the sample and enhanced uniformity of excitation.The bandwidth of rectangular pulses can be increased by reducing pulse lengths, however sufficiently broadband pulses would need to be of picosecond length.

The experimental study followed the progress of an acid-base neutralization containing a fluorophore. A simulation, which included a module for calculating the fluorescence, determined 2𝐿 for experimental energy dissipation rates (𝜖) ranging from 5x10 3 to 7.7x10 6 W/kg. 2𝐿 was found to lie in the range of turbulence dissipative scales less than the Taylor microscale but greater than the Kolmogorov microscale (𝜂). Additionally, the results provided a clear definition of the large eddy Reynolds number (𝑅𝑒 𝛬 ) of impinging sheets which previously was uncertain . 2𝐿/𝑣′ was found to be a function of 𝑅𝑒 𝛬 -1/4 and (𝜈 𝜖 ⁄ ) 1/2 , where 𝑣′ is the velocity associated with the turbulent kinetic energy and 𝜈 is the kinematic viscosity. Similar to 𝜂/𝛬, 2𝐿/𝛬 is a function of 𝑅𝑒 𝛬 -3/4 , where 𝛬 is the size of the large energy-containing eddies.', 'is to plot 2𝐿/𝛬 against (𝑅𝑒 𝛬 3 𝐶 𝜖 (1 -𝐶𝑂𝑅 2 ) as suggested by Eq. 46 where 𝑅𝑒 𝛬 is given by Eq. 43. This also provides a very good fit with R 2 = 0.966 with a power law coefficient equal to -0.34. However, the fit is not superior to ⁄ vs the two different definitions for the large-scale eddy Reynolds number (𝑅𝑒 𝛬 ). In figure a, 𝑅𝑒 𝛬 is given by Eq. 43 while in figure b, 𝑅𝑒 𝛬 is given by Eq. 44. R 2 of the power law fit in figure a is 0.971 while in figure b, R 2 is only equal to 0.70. However, the exponent for both power law fits is equal to 0.75.It appears that the key parameter to defining a representative Reynolds number for the largest eddies in the impingement zone is the width of the impingement zone (in Figure , 𝛥𝑚 ≈ 𝐶 𝜖𝐴 𝐷𝛥𝑟) and not the thickness of the single sheets at impingement (𝑠 𝑖 ). However, 𝐶 𝜖𝐴 𝐷𝛥𝑟 is directly dependent upon 𝑠 𝑖 (𝛥𝑟 = 𝑠 𝑖 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛽 ⁄ ) and further, 𝐷 is a function of the 𝐶𝑂𝑅 and 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛽. It is the projection of the single sheet into the mixed sheet (via the sine of the impingement angle) that determines the size of the largest eddies and not simply the thickness of the single sheet at impingement. Hence, Eq. 43 will be used to calculate 𝑅𝑒 𝛬 .The power law fit to Figure  with R 2 = 0.971. Interestingly, the ratio of the diffusive slab thickness to the large eddy size has the same exponent for the Reynolds number as the relationship of the Kolmogorov microscale to the large eddy size (Eq. 36). ', 'ConclusionsThe micromixing of impinging paper-thin sheets of liquids was studied by modeling an acid-base neutralization accompanied by a change in the fluorescence of a fluorophore. A simple micromixing model was employed to determine the fixed slab thickness for diffusion of acid and base within the mixed sheet. The diffusion slab thickness, 2𝐿, was found to lie between the Taylor microscale, 𝜆 𝑔 , and an order of magnitude dissipative microscale, [𝜆 = 𝜆 𝑔 /(15) 0.5 ], but well above the Kolmogorov microscale, 𝜂. Similar to the Kolmogorov microscale, the ratio of 2𝐿 to the large energy-containing eddy size, 𝛬, is a function of the Reynolds number of the largest eddies (𝑅𝑒 𝛬 ) to the -3/4 power. Similar to 𝜆 𝑔 and 𝜆, the ratio of the slab thickness to the velocity of the turbulent kinetic energy (𝑣\') is a function of (𝜈 𝜖 ⁄ ) 1/2 , where 𝜈 is the kinematic viscosity and 𝜖 is the energy dissipation rate. However, 2𝐿 𝑣′ ⁄ is also a function of the Reynolds number of the large energy-containing eddies to the -1/4 power. If these results are used for other systems, it is recommended that 𝐶 𝜖 in Eq. 50 be set equal to 𝐶 𝜖𝐴 (= 0.5).The results also verified the relationship of the dimensionless dissipation rate coefficient, 𝐶 𝜖 , with the energy dissipation rate that was found in the study on the volume of the energy dissipation zone . When the reference energy dissipation rate (𝜖 𝐼𝑍 ), calculated based on a volume equal to the impingement zone volume, is ≥ 3x10 4 W/kg, the actual energy dissipation rate equals 𝜖 𝐼𝑍 . However, if 𝜖 𝐼𝑍 ≤ 3x10 4 W/kg, then 𝜖 ≥ 𝜖 𝐼𝑍 . In this case, 𝜖 can be calculated by multiplying 𝜖 𝐼𝑍 by a correction factor, 𝐶 𝜖 𝐶 𝜖𝐴 ⁄ , where 𝐶 𝜖𝐴 is the asymptotic value of 𝐶 𝜖 , which is 0.5. For the micromixing data where 𝜖 𝐼𝑍 ≤ 3x10 4 W/kg, 𝐶 𝜖 𝐶 𝜖𝐴 ⁄ was calculated from the equation provided in reference <ref type=""bibr""', 'Reynolds number of impinging sheetsFrom turbulence energy cascade theory, the energy dissipation rate is approximated as:𝜖 ~ 𝑈 𝛬 3 𝛬 ~ 𝑈 𝛬 2 𝑡 𝛬(34)https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-xzp30 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6266-2462 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

851,"and the displacement vector s lies tangent to the manifold at q, the point q + s will generally not lie on the manifold of physically allowed configurations.In practice, this problem is usually solved by finding the point x in Cartesian space which corresponds to the valid coordinate q that is closest to q + s in redundant internal coordinate space. This can be accomplished by iterating the Newton-Raphson root-finding algorithm until convergence,x k+1 = x k + J + k (q + s -q k ) ,(32)where q k and J k are the internal coordinate vector and internal-Cartesian Jacobian matrix corresponding to x k , respectively. While this approach is computationally facile and generally converges in only a few iterations, it does not account for the curvature of the space of valid internal coordinates, which results in poor quality displacements when using highly redundant coordinate systems, for example for molecules with rings. We have previously developed an alternate approach for realizing displacements in redundant internal coordinate systems based on geodesics of the curved internal coordinate manifold. This geodesic approach accounts for the correlation between internal coordinates not only at the endpoints of the displacement, but also throughout the entire displacement trajectory. We have shown that this geodesic displacement strategy dramatically reduces the number of steps required to reach convergence in a minimization algorithm as compared to the traditional Newton displacement method. Following each geometry optimization step, the approximate Hessian is updated using the geodesic secant update, which is also described in our previous work.

While this feature improves the robustness of the optimization algorithm implemented in Q-Chem, it does so at the cost of longer trajectories for these pathological systems. In this scenario, our optimization algorithm will instead automatically reconstruct a new internal coordinate system, rather than falling back on Cartesian optimization. This results in a robust optimization algorithm similar to Q-Chem, without the additional cost of switching to a Cartesian optimization scheme.We note that while each of the four alternative algorithms resulted in some of the structures failing to converge, we do not consider this to be an appropriate metric for comparison, as the molecules in the test set were specifically chosen to be those that converge in Sella with its default parameters. Consequently, any structures that would It is common in computational studies of molecules to perform scans over specific internal coordinates. These scans are a series of constrained optimizations, which are straightforward when the goal is to minimize the energy with respect to the unconstrained degrees of freedom, e.g., when the scan is done on a minimum energy structure.However, special care must be taken for saddle point scans to ensure that the scan trajectory preserves the structure of the reacting region of the molecule and does not fall into a different saddle point geometry. Our algorithm's implementation of null-space SQP saddle point optimization provides an easy and effective way to scan coordinates.Figure depicts a full 360°scan of a dihedral angle of a 5-exo-tet cyclization reaction saddle point. The geometry of the saddle point and relative potential energy of the dihedral scan is shown in figure <ref"", '22:if B k+1 has no negative eigenvalues then until convergence criterion is met, see appendix B At each iteration of SQP minimization algorithms, the coordinates are updated with a vector s chosen to minimize the quadratic expression s T g + 1 2 s T B L s(21)Figure : An illustration of the null-space SQP method. The initial point q has gradient g (red) and does not lie on the constraint manifold (green). The constraint-correction displacement vector s P leads to the closest point on the constraint manifold. The extrapolated gradient g ex (orange) is the sum of the original gradient g and the approximate gradient Bs P (yellow) created by the displacement assuming constant curvature of the potential energy surface. The optimization displacement s Q is calculated with this extrapolated gradient in the space tangent to the constraint manifold and orthogonal to s P . These two displacement vectors are combined into the overall displacement vector s.subject to the linearized constraintc (q) + ∂c ∂q s = 0,(22)where B L is the approximate Hessian of the Lagrangian defined in equation 15. This minimization problem can be solved in a variety of ways. Our algorithm uses the nullspace SQP method, illustrated in figure , which splits the displacement vector s into two components,s = s P + s Q , (23)where s P is the constraint correction displacement vector and s Q is the optimization step displacement vector, and s P ⊥ s Q . This method was chosen as it', 'and the related algorithms are not efficient for saddle point searches on the potential energy landscapes of sparsely connected atomic systems, such as molecules, because of the strong coupling between atomic degrees of freedom. Molecular optimization (both for minima and saddle points) is generally performed in a basis of internal coordinates, which typically comprise bond stretch distances, bending angles, and dihedral angles, as internal coordinates are significantly less energetically correlated than Cartesian coordinates. These chemically relevant features provide a more effective coordinate system for optimization at the cost of additional algorithmic complexity. We have recently developed a new method for realizing displacements in a basis of redundant internal coordinates which dramatically reduces the number of steps required to reach convergence on a minimization benchmark. In this work, we extend this algorithm to optimization of saddle point geometries.Our optimization algorithm is designed to be used in automated frameworks without the need for manual intervention. However, the complexity of optimization in a basis of internal coordinates frequently frustrates attempts at automation. For example, when a bending angle of a molecule becomes linear or nearly linear during the course of optimization, displacement of the bending angle coordinate becomes ill-defined. To solve this problem, it is necessary to redefine the internal coordinate system to replace the linear bending angle with a different coordinate. Occasionally, this may require the addition of fictional ""dummy atoms"" that act as scaffolding off of which the replacement coordinate can be defined. The process of adding dummy atoms and dealing with the', '29 and 30 (for saddle point optimization) is chosen to satisfy a trust region condition. In our trust region algorithm, a displacement vector s k is accepted only if it satisfies the trust region condition,s k ∞ ≤ k , (33)where k is the size of the trust region at iteration k of the optimization. Note that this differs from our previous work in that the infinity-norm is used in the trust region condition, rather than the 2-norm. This is important for optimization in a redundant internal coordinate basis, as using the 2-norm would result in smaller displacements upon addition of new redundant coordinates to the coordinate system. This would unnecessarily slow optimization in systems with a high degree of redundancy in their internal coordinate system, as these redundant coordinates will result in larger displacement vectors in the 2-norm sense, but not necessarily in the infinity-norm sense.The means by which equation 33 is enforced depends on the relative magnitudes of s P and s Q . If s P ∞ ≥ k , then the constraint correction step by itself is too large to fit within the trust region, and thus the displacement step is chosen to bes k = k s P ∞ s P ,(34)meaning that no optimization step is taken in the unconstrained space. In this scenario, s Q is not used or even calculated at this iteration of the optimization algorithm. Ifs P ∞ < k , then s Q is calculated with an initial value of α = 1. If s P + s Q ∞ ≤ k ,then the overall displacement s k = s P + s Q is accepted. Otherwise, a value of α is determined for which s P + s Q (α) ∞ = k using the Newton-Raphson root-finding algorithm.After every optimization step, our algorithm checks to see whether the trust region size k needs to be updated. This is', 'and s Q is the optimization step displacement vector, and s P ⊥ s Q . This method was chosen as it reduces the dimensionality of the optimization problem by the size of the space spanned by the constraint equations. The vector s P is defined as the least-squares solution to equation 22,∂c ∂q s P = -c(q).(24)In null-space SQP minimization algorithms, the vector s Q is found by minimizing the projected quadratic approximationsT Q gex + 1 2 sT Q BL sQ ,(25)wheregex = g + Q T Bs P(26)is the gradient which has been first approximately extrapolated to the point q + s P and then projected into the unconstrained nonredundant space.Note that equation 25 is the traditional quadratic approximation to the potential energy surface, but with the gradient g replaced by the extrapolated gradient gex and the approximate Hessian of the potential energy B replaced by the approximate Hessian of the Lagrangian BL . Therefore, the procedure for obtaining s Q described above is equivalent to standard quasi-Newton minimization with some modifications to the gradient and approximate Hessian. It is possible to perform a constrained minimization using an alternative approach such as the restricted step rational function optimization (RS-RFO) method by making these same substitutions. This is useful, as unlike quasi-Newton, RS-RFO guarantees a downhill step even when the approximate Hessian BL is indefinite. Furthermore, making these substitutions in the restricted step partitioned rational function optimization (RS-PRFO) method will result in a constrained saddle point optimization step. <ref']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Theoretical methods']",2455,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9630522232247416,-2.220446049250313e-16,['why']

Upon excitation to the higher 1 2 Π and 2 2 Σ + states, the electron remains localized at the metal and occupies the hybridized pπ-dπ and pσdσ orbitals, respectively. The orbital hybridization arises due to the presence of the negatively charged ligand and can be reproduced by perturbatively adding a point-charge potential to the Hamiltonian of a hydrogen-like atom .While the electron remains largely localized at the metal, the minor leakage to the ligand is always present, leading to slightly non-diagonal', 'transitions in ACCA and ACCB. The number of entangled states is generally close to 4 in ACCA molecules, and is reduced in ACCB, reflecting the independent nature of the electronic excitation of each unpaired electron in ACCB.This work highlights the rich electronic structure of hypermetallic molecules that may give rise to novel applications in QIS, precision measurements, and ultra-cold chemistry. Future studies will involve the study of molecules with varied linkers and the exploration of the suitability of these molecules for laser cooling. A particular interest also lies in the investigations of the doubly excited states and electronic structure properties of the Rydberg states.FIG. 2 :2FIG. 2: EOM-SF (top) and EOM-DEA (bottom) ansätze allow access to diradical states. In the EOM-SF method, the target low-spin Ψ Ms=0 states are reached by applying spin-flipping excitation operator RMs=-1 to the high-spin reference Ψ Ms=1 state: Ψ Ms=0 = RMs=-1 Ψ Ms=1 . Excitations from the doubly occupied orbitals are not shown. In the EOM-DEA method, the target Ψ N states are reached by applying excitation operator R(+2), which adds two electrons to the closed-shell reference Ψ N -2 with N -2 electrons: Ψ N = R+2 Ψ N -2 . Only configurations generated by the two-particle part of R+2 are shown.', 'pure covalent character with the n u,nl = 2.00. The singlet-triplet energy gaps do not exceed 0.02 eV, further indicating the weak interaction between the two unpaired electrons.Interestingly, the covalent character of the ground state wavefunction of ACCAs increases when the metal is changed from Mg to Ca to Sr, as evidenced by the increasing n u,nl (Table in SI). This observation is consistent with the increasing ionic character of A-C bonds in ACCA as the partial charge on metal increases from 0.21 in MgCCMg to 0.29 in CaCCCa to 0.47 in SrCCSr. In parallel, the singlet-triplet gap decreases from 0.016 eV in MgCCMg to 0.003 eV in CaCCCa and completely vanishes in SrCCSr, further supporting that the interaction between two electrons decreases as the metal changes.The structure of the excited states in all three ACCA follows the same pattern as in Li 2discussed above. The 1 2 Π and 2 2 Σ + states of the single-center ACCH are split into the Π g/u and Σ + u/g pairs in both singlet and triplet manifolds in ACCA (Figure ). Due to the symmetry, one of the states is dark and the other is bright with the oscillator strength doubled relative to ACCH. The energy splittings are relatively small, within 0.02-0.1 eV, reflecting a weak interaction between two electrons in the excited states. In MgCCMg, a pair of the ionic (chargeresonance) states lies in between the 1 Π g/u and 1 Σ + u/g pairs, whereas in CaCCCa and SrCCSr these states appear above 1 Π g/u and 1 Σ + u/g pairs (compare positions of blue and black bars in Figure ). For all considered transitions, the number of entangled states is 3.8-4.5 (Table in SI).Similarly to the case of Li 2 , the single-electron excitation may result in four partially occupied orbitals as can be concluded from the values of n u,nl that are close to 2.25 (Table <ref', ""at the metal, the minor leakage to the ligand is always present, leading to slightly non-diagonal FCFs that depend on both alkaline earth metal and the ligand. For example, although the Dyson orbitals in the three ACCHs look similar (Figure in the SI), in MgCCH the unpaired electron resides closer to the CCH moiety as compared to CaCCH and SrCCH. Indeed, Mulliken's population analysis confirms that the partial charge at the metal increases from 0.21 in MgCCH to 0.39 in CaCCH to 0.54 in SrCCH, suggesting that the A-C bond becomes more ionic and the unpaired electron more localized at the metal. This conclusion is further confirmed by that fact that among the three alkaline earth metals the ionization energy is the largest for Mg atom and the smallest for Sr (Table in the SI). Accordingly, excitation energies to 1 2 Π and 2 2 Σ + in ACCH decrease as the alkaline metal is changed from Mg to Ca to Sr (Figure )-a trend that is also observed in the properties of the ACCA molecules.In ACCA, the two alkaline earth metals are rigidly held at the distance of 5.3-6.1 Å (depending on the metal) by the acetylene linker. In all three systems, the singlet is the ground state.The singlet-triplet gap is small and decreases in the Mg→Ca→Sr series (0.016-0.003-∼0 eV).  in the SI.The trends in the singlet-triplet gaps indicate strong diradical character and weak bonding interactions between the unpaired electrons. Drawing from the studies of the organic diradicals and triradicals , the differences in the equilibrium geometries of singlet and triplet states can also be used to quantify the extent of the diradical character. In molecules with large diradical character, the geometries of singlet and triplet states are quite similar, while in closed-shell molecules"", 'other and thus minimizing the throughspace interaction between the electrons.Second, the communication between two electrons occurs largely through the acetylene linker via through-bond interaction rather than through space as evident from the ordering of the natural orbitals. However, design of hypermetallic molecules with linkers different from those shown in Figure may facilitate through-space interactions. Despite these difference, the spectrum of ACCA molecules is similar to that of Li 2 and, in addition to the ionic states, consists from the pairs of dark and bright states. Noteworthy, the oscillator strength of these bright states is doubled as compared to the monomeric ACCH.Third, because of the strongly ionic character of A-C bonds, ACCB show negative DSEs, despite weak stabilizing interactions between the unpaired electrons manifested in singlets being below triplets. We attribute the origin of negative DSEs to Coulomb repulsion between carbons in the charged acetylenic linker. When the Coulomb repulsion contribution is removed, DSEs become positive, reflecting bonding interactions between the unpaired electrons, and their magnitudes fall in a range typical for molecules with strong diradical character (∼0-23 kcal/mol).In ACCB molecules, the overall spectrum corresponds to the sum of the ACCH and BCCH spectra with the presence of the ionic states. Natural orbital analysis of the excited states showed that the two electrons act independently: upon excitation one of the electron remains in the local ground state, while the second electron becomes locally excited. Yet, the interaction between two electrons cannot be considered negligible as the excitation energies in ACCB are shifted by 0.01-0.08 eV as compared to the corresponding ACCH. Analysis of the entanglement further highlights different nature of electronic transitions in ACCA and ACCB. The number of entangled states is generally close to 4 in ACCA']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Quantum computing']",3517,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.8675903675765744,0.0,['how']

Thus, coarse-grained molecular simulations of amyloid fibril formation are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism behind the formation of these structures, which are implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Type II diabetes. Network Hamiltonian simulations of aggregation are centered around a Hamiltonian function that returns the total energy of a system of aggregating proteins, given the graph structure of the system as input.

They are commonly used to provide trial wavefunctions in the VQE method for searching the ground state. Excited-state preparation schemes require additional features compared to that of the ground state. For example, the excitedstate ansatz should be capable of populating particular electronic configurations out of the entire Hilbert space (e.g., singlet-coupled HOMO-LUMO excitation). In addition, the ansatz should be able to easily adjust the components of a desired quantum state. Consider, for instance, the H 2 /6-31G example for which the number of all possible electronic configurations is 8 2 .

Next, one designs unitary operators using the Gray code decomposition as shown in the example quantum circuit of particles with respect to the reference qubit state. The subsequent multi-qubit controlled-R y (θ i ) creates additional 1 particle to the state (completion of M hM p excitation) as well as introduces the parameters to the reference (cos θ i 2 ) and the target excited determinant (sin θ i 2 ). The Gray code for the single unitary operation is completed by the same 2M -1 multi-qubit controlled-NOT gates, but in the reversed order. It should be mentioned that the target electronic configurations do not have to be populated from the fixed reference state. For example, the doubly excited determinant of Eq. ( ) can be created from one of the singly excited determinants giving rise to different parameterizationsU (θ 3 )U (θ 2 )U (θ 1 )|1100⟩ = cos θ 1 2 cos θ 2 2 |1100⟩ + sin θ 1 2 cos θ 3 2 |0110⟩ + cos θ 1 2 sin θ 2 2 |1001⟩ + sin θ 1 2 sin θ 3 2 |0011⟩,(37)where two singly excited Slater determinants (|0110⟩ and |1001⟩) are generated by single excitation with respect to the reference |1100⟩, and the doubly excited configuration |0011⟩ is', 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b41"">[42] . The focus of this paper is on the incorporation of the Davidson procedure into the qEOM protocol, which we call the qEOM-UCC/Davidson algorithm. The key feature of the Davidson implementation on quantum devices is the design of a unitary ansatz that generates specific quantum superposition states, which is achieved by using Gray code decomposition . The proposed ansatz enables targeting a specific subspace within the Hilbert space based on the feedback from the Davidson procedure. Hence, instead of computing the entire eigen-spectrum of the Hamiltonian, our qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson algorithm is capable of computing several transitions of a particular type by defining suitable subspace vectors. Here we focus on finding low-lying states of a given symmetry/spin, but the algorithm can be easily extended to finding states around the specified energy or of a particular type (e.g., such as excitations between specific orbitals).The structure of the paper is as follows: Sec. II A discusses EOM formalism, Sec. II B describes the choice of the ground-state ansatz for quantum computing and its incorporation within EOM, Sec. II C explains the Davidson procedure with qEOM implemented on quantum devices, Sec. II D presents the detailed circuit design, and Sec. III presents the variational extension of the proposed algorithm. Sec. IV provides computational details of illustrative calculations and Sec. V presents the numerical results using a set of small molecules (H 2 , H 4 , LiH, and H 2 O). Sec. VI gives our concluding remarks.', 'Considering the Davidson method the particular set of {|Φ µ ⟩} can be obtained by examining the residual vectors. Hence, one needs to construct the quantum circuit that generates an arbitrary vector subspace where {|Φ µ ⟩} spans, and introduce corresponding {γ k µ } as variational parameters to find a k th state. Since the number of state vectors (= the number of variational parameters) that construct the vector subspace is considerably smaller than that of the entire Hilbert space, the variational approach with the Davidson formalism helps to circumvent barren plateaus phenomenon .In practical applications, we need to preserve the spin-symmetry and ensure the orthonormality between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in the course of the minimization process.To achieve this, we generalize the spin-restricted form of the Gray code circuit with minor modifications of the scheme introduced in the previous section. To illustrate this, let us examine the H 2 /STO-3G system, which corresponds to Eq. ( ), and try to find the S 1 state variationally. The Gray code scheme for the non-variational approach in the previous section creates the desired quantum superposition by connecting the fixed reference state with the target excited Slater determinant at a time. In this way, one introduces parameters to both reference and target configurations at each operation. There is no direct connection between excited configurations, which have to be spin-adapted, e.g., between |0110⟩ and |1001⟩ of Eq. ( ). As a result, the variational process with this circuit construction never produces S 1 state as the solution because T 1 state is always lower than S 1 in H 2 /STO-3G.

The HOMA value H is defined as\uf028 \uf029 2 opt 1 α 1 n i i H R R n \uf03d \uf03d \uf02d \uf02d \uf0e5 (1)and is related to the deformation energy of a \uf070-electron system, approximated by a harmonic potential around the ideal aromatic bond length Ropt. In Equation ( ), n is the number of bonds (with lengths Ri) in the conjugation path. The parameter \uf061 is an empirical constant chosen to give H = 1 for the ideal aromatic system of benzene (with six equal bond lengths) and H = 0 for the hypothetical Kekulé cyclohexatriene structure of benzene (with three single and three double bonds). The physical meaning of H is based on the fact that bonds in a conjugated \uf070-electron system have lengths between pure \uf073and \uf070-bonds, which means that the \uf073-bonds are compressed and the \uf070-bonds are extended in the final equilibrium structure. Both the \uf073-bond compression and the \uf070-bond extension cost energy. Ropt represents the optimum bond lengths, at which compression of the typical \uf073-bond to the value of Ropt is equal to the energy of extension of a typical \uf070-bond to Ropt. For the HOMA values discussed below, we used the bond lengths obtained from the DFToptimized structures of the two molecules (PBE functional).

A high HOMA value', 'Topology Effects in Molecular Organic Electronic Materials: Pyrene and Azupyrene Pyrene derivatives play a prominent role in organic electronic devices, including field effect transistors, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. The flexibility in the desired properties has previously been achieved by variation of substituents at the periphery of the pyrene backbone. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the central \uf070-electron system on the relevant properties such as the band gap or the fluorescence behavior has not yet been addressed. In this work, pyrene is compared with its structural isomer azupyrene, which has a \uf070-electron system with nonalternant topology. Using photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and other methods, it is shown that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of pyrene. The difference of the optical band gaps is even larger with 1.09 eV, as determined by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. The nonalternant nature of azupyrene is also associated with a more localized charge distribution, as can be seen in 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance shifts, as well as the C1s core-level shifts. Further insight is provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the molecular properties and ab initio coupled cluster calculations of the optical transitions. The concept of aromaticity is used to interpret DFT-based structures and for the theoretical assignment of the vibrational modes of the infrared spectra, where major topology-related differences are apparent.', ""doubly bridged by ethenediyl units (Figure , right). The two apical rings form Clar sextets (2 × 6 \uf070-electrons) and the ethylene bridges form quasi-isolated double bonds (2 × 2 \uf070electrons). Thus, the 16 \uf070-electron system of pyrene can be described as a 6\uf070 + 6\uf070 + 2\uf070 + 2\uf070 system.Azupyrene has a large EPC value of 0.37, a short central bond (138 pm) with pronounced double-bond character, and elongated bonds (147 pm) with single-bond character connecting the central two carbon atoms to the perimeter. These facts are in agreement with the description of azupyrene as a [14]annulene with a central C2 bridge that is partly decoupled from the annulene's \uf070-system (Figure , right). In this way, the 16 \uf070-electrons are divided in the 14 \uf070-electrons on the perimeter and 2 \uf070-electrons in the quasi-isolated central double bond, forming two Hückel-compliant systems (14\uf070 + 2\uf070 system). This is not a trivial finding, because the molecule could also form a 6\uf070 + 6\uf070 + 2\uf070 + 2\uf070 system with two negative 6\uf070 cyclopentadienyl (Cp -) rings bridged by two positive propenediyliumbridges (Pr + ). Such a conjugation type is contradicted by the HOMA values and the bond length pattern. In addition, if azupyrene would follow the latter conjugation mechanism, it should possess a strong quadrupole moment (in analogy to the dipole moment of azulene), which is not present in our DFT calculations. "", ""conjugation paths exist, each of which is characterized by its HOMA value. A high HOMA value indicates that this particular path strongly contributes to the aromatic stabilization. It is also possible to consider all \uf070-bonds in the molecule; the corresponding HOMA value is called the overall HOMA value O. If the conjugation path along the perimeter \uf070-bonds of the molecule is considered, this is called the perimeter HOMA value P. Likewise, the HOMA value R for each ring can be calculated separately.For convenience, we also calculated the Excess Perimeter Conjugation (EPC) value, which is defined as EPC = P-O. This parameter indicates whether the molecule shows annulenoid character, i.e., the aromatic conjugation is predominantly on the perimeter of the molecule (high EPC), or benzenoid character, i.e., the conjugation is distributed over the whole molecule equally (low EPC). The results of the HOMA analysis are compiled in Figure .Both molecules comprise 16 \uf070-electrons. A conjugation pathway including all 16 \uf070electrons would be anti-aromatic, according to Hückel's 4n rule. However, for neither molecule a conjugation path with 16 \uf070-electrons exists and pyrene as well as azupyrene are aromatic, as is proven by the 1 H-NMR shifts (see Figure ). While both molecules are aromatic, the difference between them lies in the different conjugation mechanism leading to the aromatic stabilization.Pyrene has a small EPC value of 0.04, which indicates that no annulenoid conjugation is present. The two apical rings possess higher HOMA values than the two other rings and these rings with the smaller HOMA value have one especially short bond. Both facts indicate that the most fitting description of the pyrene molecule is a biphenyl doubly bridged by ethenediyl units (Figure , right)."", ""ConclusionOur systematic multi-technique comparison of the organic semiconductor pyrene and its nonalternant isomer azupyrene revealed major topology-related differences of their electronic properties. UPS and NEXAFS show that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of the alternant molecule pyrene, and theory predicts a very similar difference of 0.87 eV. The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding an even larger difference of 1.09 eV. One reason why this difference is larger for azupyrene is due to symmetry selection rules, which result in a forbidden HOMO→LUMO transition and the lack of fluorescence for azupyrene. These special properties of azupyrene's electronic structure are related to the nonalternant topology of its \uf070-electron system. The topology of azupyrene also leads to a more localized charge distribution, visible in the experimental XPS and NMR shifts as well as in the DFT-calculated partial charges, all showing a negative charge surplus at the apices of the 7-membered rings and positive charge at the central C2-unit. The conjugated system of pyrene is best described as a biphenyl with two ethenediyl bridges, whereas azupyrene is a [14]annulene with a central double-bonded C2 unit. This interpretation follows from HOMA considerations, bond length changes, and the vibrational modes seen in experimental and calculated IR spectra. Overall, we found that the topology of the \uf070electron system drastically influences the electronic structure of the two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Those differences in electronic structure are reflected in the absorption and fluorescence behavior, a lower electron-hole binding energy, and a lower barrier to electron-hole separation for azupyrene. The possible application of nonalternant molecules in organic electronic devices is favored by those differences.

This result confirms that the amount of T 1 predicted here using the upper bound for the ISC rate constant that we have determined is an overestimate, and thus the true ISC rate constant is lower than this value.The upper bound of k ISC for TIPS-Pn is greater than the pseudo-first-order SF rate constant (k SF [S 0 ]) up to a concentration of 1.45 mM, where k ISC and k SF [S 0 ] are equal.

ISC in the literatureWith an upper bound of the ISC rate constant of TIPS-Pn and the bimolecular SF rate constant in solution, we can compare our findings to other observations of ISC and SF in the literature. (4) and ( ) with bimolecular SF rate constants that have been adjusted for the presence of ISC (fit).used. Substituting this ISC rate into the SF model described by Eqs. ( ) and ( ) leads to 17% T 1 production for a singlet lifetime of 18 ns and 13% T 1 for a lifetime of 13 ns (Table ). This amount of triplet formation was absent in their experimental data, so this ISC rate is unfeasibly fast. Note that the T 1 lifetime used does affect the predicted T 1 yield on a microsecond time scale, so we have used the 6.7 µs reported by Walker et al., which is already much shorter than other estimates (Table ). The T 1 lifetime would have to be as short as 100 ns to begin to approach undetectable T 1 levels. If we instead use the upper limit of the ISC rate constant found here, a triplet yield of less than 4.3% at 10 µs is predicted, which is more consistent with their experimental observations. Our findings are also consistent with the observations of Schaberle et al. who observed negligible triplets in 0.001 mM solutions in toluene or 0.39 mM solutions of chloroform, respectively. At these concentrations, the upper bound of the ISC rate constant, 3.08 × 10 6 s -1 , predicts triplet yields of 6.2% or less at 0.001 mM and 7.2% or less at 0.39 mM. Their data may show even less triplet formation than this (it is difficult to say without knowing the detection limit), but these values are consistent as upper bounds regardless.A series of papers by Grieco et al. also refer to ISC', 'with the trend in the modeled data due to an increasing triplet population. The magnitude of this increase in the experimental data over 8 ns is about 2.3% of the GSB magnitude, which is approximately equivalent to 0.041 mOD. An upper bound of 0.049 mOD T 1 absorption is therefore a reasonable estimate.For TIPS-Tn, SF begins to produce the same amount of triplet excitons as the upper limit of ISC at a concentration of 2.1 mM. At 8 mM, this rate of ISC would account for 22% of triplets formed by 8 ns. So as with TIPS-Pn, the assumption of negligible ISC when fitting the bimolecular SF rate constant is potentially invalid. Refitting the deconvoluted concentrations of the 8 mM TA with an ISC rate constant of 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 , gives a bimolecular SF rate constant of (2.0 ± 0.6) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 (supplementary material Sec. S4. 3.3, Fig. 6(d)). Using this adjusted rate at 0.05 mM results in 2.7×10 -10 M of triplets formed due to SF, which is still substantially lower than the limit of detection, so an upper bound of 118 ns for ISC is still valid. As with TIPS-Pn, the 8 mM TIPS-Tn S 1 population decays faster and fits slightly better than without ISC. Given that 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 is an upper bound on the ISC rate constant, the range of bimolecular SF rate constants can now be considered to be between 1.4 × 10 9 M -1 s -1 (lower bound of T 1 concentration, upper bound of ISC) to 3.2×10 9 M -1 s -1 (upper bound of T 1 concentration, no ISC), or (2.3±0.9)×10 9 M -1 s -1 .We again note that, as for TIPS-Pn, the adjusted value of the SF rate constant does not affect the previously determined upper bound for the ISC rate constant. These results especially highlight the necessity to consider ISC when quantifying SF, even if it is assumed to be slow, as without doing so, the SF rate constant could potentially be overestimated.', 'IV. CONCLUSIONSUsing transient absorption spectroscopy of 0.05 mM and 8 mM solutions of TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn in toluene, we have quantified an upper bound on the rate constant (lower bound on the time constant) of intersystem crossing (ISC) in these solutions as 3.08 × 10 6 s -1 (325 ns) and 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 (118 ns), respectively. Taking the ISC rate constants into account, we were also able to quantify the bimolecular singlet fission (SF) rate constants in these solutions as (2.6 ± 0.7) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 for TIPS-Pn, and (2.3 ± 0.9) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 for TIPS-Tn, where the range of values comes from the uncertainty in the ISC rate constant and in the T 1 basis spectra. We have pointed out some discrepancies in the literature, and shown that ISC can be overestimated by disregarding diffusion-limited SF in dilute solutions. Alternatively, SF can also be overestimated by not appropriately considering T 1 contributions from ISC. For systems in which SF is relatively slow, or is limited by diffusion through solution or exciton diffusion through a disordered material, the effect of ISC is particularly important. To make progress in the implementation of SF in photovoltaic devices (or in fact in other applications, such as quantum computing), it is important to accurately identify and quantify SF rate constants and yields, which would be impossible in many circumstances if ISC is not also considered.FIG. 1 .1FIG. 1. TA of TIPS-Pn in toluene at 0.05 mM [(a) and (b)] and 8 mM [(c) and (d)], exciting at 405 nm at 3.8 mW. (a) and (c) show the raw TA data, while (b) and (d) show the average shape between 50-150 ps,and 7500-8000 ps, normalized to the GSB at 647 nm. There is minimal shape change over time for 0.05 mM, but significant change for 8 mM due to SF.', 'initial S 1 concentration.To determine the SF contribution to this maximum possible triplet formation at 0.05 mM, we used the SF model described by Eqs. ( ) and ( ), with k SF set to the lower bound of the fit to the 8 mM data (2.1 × 10 9 M -1 s -1 ), and k ISC set to 0. As with the 8 mM sample, the excited-state concentration was significantly smaller than 0.05 mM (<1%), so we treated [S 0 ] as constant. This model gave a maximum of 2.6 × 10 -10 M of T 1 formed after 8 ns for a 0.05 mM sample (0.14% of the initial S 1 concentration). This concentration corresponds to a maximum absorption of about 0.004 mOD, which is well below the possible threshold of our TA spectrometer (supplementary material Fig. ), and still leaves 3.7 × 10 -9 M of T 1 that could be due to ISC.If we allow an ISC rate constant of 3.08 × 10 6 s -1 (or a time constant of 325 ns) on top of the contribution from SF, 3.7 × 10 -9 M of T 1 are produced from ISC, and we obtain a total T 1 concentration of reach the 4.0 × 10 -9 M, or 0.057 mOD T 1 absorption limit, at 8 ns. The actual ISC rate constant therefore must be lower than (or equal to) this value, as a higher value would result in a level of triplet formation that would be observable above the noise level in the TA data.We therefore give the ISC rate constant an upper bound of 3.08 × 10 6 s -1 , i.e., the characteristic time scale of ISC in TIPS-Pn must be longer than 325 ns. This corresponds to a ISC quantum yield of ≤5.6% at 0.05 mM. The 8 ns time window we use in this study is significantly shorter than this time constant, and we note that ISC could possibly be shown to be even slower with a longer time-window TA experiment. equal to the experimental data. Even with this noise, there is a slight observable trend with time in the modeled data corresponding to an increase in T 1', 'in a revised 2.4 × 10 -10 M of T 1 formed due to SF, which is still substantially lower than the limit of detection, and does not affect the upper bound of the ISC rate constant determined here.An upper bound on the rate constant of ISC for TIPS-Tn was determined in a similar manner to that for TIPS-Pn. The TA noise level was determined to be 0.016 mOD, so the maximum triplet absorption at 8 ns is 0.049 mOD. Using the lower bound of the T 1 basis spectrum, this absorption corresponds to a triplet concentration of 1.6 × 10 -8 M (5.2% of the initial S 1 population). This value is higher than for TIPS-Pn, potentially because the T 1 absorption is both less intense and less distinct from S 1 for TIPS-Tn triplets than for TIPS-Pn triplets, or because some triplets actually form over 8 ns, which contribute to the measured noise. Modeling the 0.05 mM concentration without ISC using a bimolecular SF rate constant of 2.0×10 9 M -1 s -1 gives a T 1 concentration of 3.6×10 -10 M, corresponding to an absorbance of 0.001 mOD (supplementary material Fig. ).If we add in an ISC rate constant of 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 (time constant of 118 ns) we reach a total T 1 concentration (from ISC and SF) of 1.6 × 10 -8 M at 8 ns, which matches the noise limit. Hence the ISC rate constant of TIPS-Tn in toluene should be smaller than 8.50 × 10 6 s -1 , or the time constant should be longer than 118 ns. This rate constant corresponds to an ISC quantum yield of 11% at 0.05 mM. Figure shows the experimental and modeled TA data around the triplet peak maximum at 508 nm. The modeled data include artificial noise from a Gaussian distribution with the same standard deviation as the experimental TA data. On close inspection, the experimental TA data around 508 nm does in fact show some shape change over 8 ns, consistent with the trend in the modeled data due to an increasing triplet population.

347,".The 77 K resonance Raman spectrum of lycopene in diethyl ether (polarizability 0.230) is shown in figure . The 1 band is observed at 1517 cm -1 , a frequency expected for a carotenoid containing eleven conjugated C=C bonds (it may downshift up to 2 cm -1 for highly polar solvents). The 2 region displays a main band at 1155 cm -1 and is typical for lycopene in the all-trans configuration. Finally, the 4 region exhibits a small, structure-less envelope characteristic of carotenoid in a relaxed conformation in solution. Figure shows the equivalent spectrum for lycopene aggregates measured using five different excitation wavelengths (363.8, 488.0, 501.7, 514.5, and 577.0 nm) (for room temperature resonance Raman, see supporting information, figure ). The position of the 1 band of lycopene aggregates exhibits a clear dependence on the excitation wavelength, peaking at 1511, 1529, 1526, 1522 & 1511 cm -1 for 363.8, 488.0, 501.7, 514.5, & 577.0 nm excitation, respectively. At 488.0, 501.7 and 514.5 nm, it is accompanied by a small shoulder at 1511 cm -1 whose intensity decreases as the excitation moves to the red. Monomeric lycopene may absorb at 488.0, 501.7 and 514.5 nm, but the position of the corresponding 1 bands (1529, 1526, and 1522 cm -1 ) are shifted to higher frequencies relative to lycopene in ethyl acetate (1517 cm -1 ), indicating that no lycopene monomers are present in the sample .

Assignment of the absorption bands at 355 and 568 nm needs a more detailed analysis. The same \uf06e1 frequency (1511 cm -1 ) is observed for excitations in both transitions (363.8 and 577.0 nm, respectively). This could imply that these bands are two different electronic transitions of the same species. While the ratio between the \uf06e3 band at 1005 cm -1 and the band at 958 cm -1 appears different between 577.0 and 363.8 nm excitation, this could originate from the different excited states used to induce resonance. These spectra can thus be interpreted in two ways. First, only one strongly-coupled H-type species is present in the mixture (species 4), corresponding to a highly twisted/bent lycopene displaying two electronic transitions at 577.0 & 363.8 nm. Alternatively, two strongly-coupled H-type species are present in the sample (species 5 & 6), absorbing at 355 and 568 nm, respectively, with the former packing the lycopene in a somewhat more relaxed conformation than the latter. Species 1, 2 & 3 (as well as species 6 if there) can be assigned to helical organizations of H-type aggregates, which have been shown to produce an absorption redshift depending on the twisting angle . Species 5, if present, would correspond to pure H-type aggregates with a strong absorption blue-shift. On the other hand, the possibility of species 4, presenting absorption at 577.0 nm and 363.8 nm, is highly puzzling. Although carotenoid H-aggregates have been reported with similar electronic transitions, it was never formally shown that both transitions arose from the same aggregate, as the homogeneity of the aggregate preparation was not verified. We propose that the characteristics of species 4 would correspond to the properties predicted by calculations obtained for medium-strength coupled H-aggregates in carotenes , where there is a main', 'ResultsThe absorption spectrum of monomeric lycopene in n-hexane exhibits three sharp bands, located at 442.4, 470.4 and 501.7 nm, respectively, corresponding to the 0-2, 0-1 and 0-0 vibronic levels of the S0\uf0aeS2 electronic transition (figure 1, solid blue line). These absorption transitions redshift with increasing polarizability of the environment, the 0-0 transition reaching 543 nm in carbon disulfide (figure 1, dotted blue line) . Lycopene aggregates (red curve in figure ) display a very different absorption spectrum, featuring a pronounced band peaking at 355 nm with a shoulder around 375 nm, then two bands at ca 414 & 481 nm, and a very redshifted band at 568 nm. A long absorption tail extending up to 700 nm is also visible. Lycopene aggregates, prepared by different protocols or formed naturally in chromoplasts, lead invariably to similar spectral features, as previously observed in tomato chromoplasts , lycopene films , and lycopene crystalloids .There is a consensus that these features are due to excitonic interactions , but no clear description of the origin of these bands has been proposed. The peak at 355 nm is an unmistakable signature of lycopene forming strong excitonic interactions in H-type aggregates, whereas the bands with small blue or red shifts (481 & 514 nm) and the largely redshifted 568 nm band remain controversial. Resonance Raman scattering spectroscopy is a highly sensitive tool to investigate multiple species in a complex matrix. In the resonance condition, when the energy of the incident light matches the electronic transition', 'DiscussionThe data from resonance Raman measurements shows that the \uf06e1 frequency shifts with different excitation wavelengths, indicating that strong excitonic coupling between lycopene molecules affects the vibrational frequencies. From the analysis of the \uf06e1 and \uf06e2 regions, we observe that the sample contains at least four, and probably five species of lycopene aggregates. These observations are further supported by the complicated dynamics of femtosecond-to-nanosecond transient absorption. While it is, in principle, conceivable that a single type of aggregate or crystal could exhibit the number of evolutionary steps observed, it is hard to see how so many steps would result in the rise and fall of so many bands at more or less the same wavelengths. A more plausible explanation is that multiple types of aggregate are present in the sample with similarly (but not identically) positioned spectral bands, exhibiting overlapping dynamics. 2. Vibrational cooling of the hot S1 state, typically occurring in monomeric carotenoids on a sub-ps timescale , which manifests itself as a narrowing and blue-shift of the IA band peaking at ca, 570 nm in lycopene monomers. We have already hypothesized three coexisting moieties with at least five (S2, hot S1, S1, S*, T1) interconnected excited states. This is more than enough to over-parametrize the datasets that are satisfactorily described by the 8 time constants (five in the fs-ns range plus three in the ns-µs range).The electronic signatures for the excited states are highly distorted from the well-characterized signatures for monomeric or weakly-interacting carotenoids. It is reasonable that the excited states experiment a similar degree of aggregation-associated spectral distortion as that seen for the ground states in the absorption spectrum. However, based on the lifetimes obtained it is tempting to propose a tentative', 'In the resonance condition, when the energy of the incident light matches the electronic transition of a sub-population in the complex mixture, contributions from this subset of molecules may be selectively observed, and the narrowing of the electronic transitions at low temperatures increases this selectivity . This technique thus allows for the observation of the vibrational properties of different lycopene species in a mixture, provided that they display different absorption properties. Resonance Raman spectra of carotenoids contain four main groups of bands, \uf06e1 through \uf06e4, each providing specific information on the conformation and/or configuration of the scattering molecule(s) . In the high-frequency region, the intense ν1 band around 1500-1530 cm arises from stretching vibrations of the conjugated C=C bonds in the polyene chain. In carotenoid monomers, its precise frequency depends on the effective conjugation length of the molecule , which is related to the energy of the ground-state. In aggregates, it can be used to probe intermolecular interactions, on the basis of their ground-state properties  These modes constitute a fingerprint region for determining carotenoid isomerization states (trans/cis) . The \uf06e4 mode around 960 cm -1 arises from C-H out-of-plane wagging motions coupled with C=C torsional modes , and this region is an indicator of out-of-plane distortions of the carotenoid conjugated chain .The 77 K resonance Raman spectrum of lycopene in diethyl ether (polarizability 0.230) is', 'vibrational modes in the \uf06e4 region observed for 514.5 nm excitation are significantly lower in intensity, and appear at 950, 955, and 963 cm -1 . The absorption at 514 nm thus arises from a different lycopene species, for which the packing twists/bends their backbone to a lesser extent and induces a different configuration (different position of the vibrational modes). The \uf06e4 regions observed for 488.0 nm and 501.7 nm excitation are similar to carotenoids in solution, indicating the presence of carotenoids with an unstrained conformation in these aggregates.The resonance Raman data thus reveal the presence of several different lycopene aggregated species.

However, antibiotic residues in food animals will be transmitted to the human through the food chain, destroying human microbiome and inducing bacteria to develop drug resistance (Fig ) . It is also noteworthy that many antibiotics are eventually discharged into the environment especially for aquaculture . A recent investigation reveals a high level content of antibiotics, such as sulfonamides, in the surface water in different countries, which will cause serious antimicrobial resistance problems (Fig ) .

A further time-killing kinetics study on K18S4 against Grampositive bacteria S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and V. anguillarum (a representative of the common pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture) revealed a quick killing of bacteria at 2×MIC concentration of K18S4, such as the complete killing of V. anguillarum within 30 minutes (Fig ). The bacteria-killing of K18S4 was much faster than that of conventional antibiotic thiamphenicol, indicating advantages of K18S4 in treating aquacultureencountered bacterial infections.To examine if bacteria can develop resistance to the peptide polymers, we treated Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli with K18S4 at 0.5×MBC concentration continuously, and found that none of the bacteria developed resistance against K18S4 even after continuous treatment for 888 and 1152 generations of S. aureus and Even if an antibacterial agent, such as K18S4, shows low tendency to induce antimicrobial resistance, full degradability is still highly desired for antibiotic substitutes in aquaculture. The massive use and subsequent discharge of the antimicrobial agents to the environment may cause antimicrobial selective pressure and disruption of balance of the complicated microbial system in the environment, which is a big concern in massive use of antibiotics in aquaculture. Therefore, an ideal substitution of antibiotics in aquaculture should be fully degradable to individual residues and thus lose antibacterial activity completely after degradation. K18S4 was completely degraded within 6 hours in the presence of protease type XXIII from Aspergillus oryzae, as confirmed by NMR analysis on the disappearance of the characteristic peaks for α-CH group on the peptide backbone at In addition to enzymes produced by microorganisms, K18S4 can also be degraded by trypsin and chymotrypsin that are widely distributed in the digestive tract.

It is estimated that drug-resistant bacteria will cause about 10 million deaths per year by 2050, if no effective action is taken immediately . As early as 2006, the European Union announced a total ban on the use of antibiotics in feed. Subsequently, the United States, Japan, China and other countries successively promulgated various policies to reduce or even prohibit the use of antibiotics in feed . It is a consensus that it is imperative to prohibit the massive use of antibiotics all over the world in food animals, including aquaculture.In order to replace the use of antibiotics in aquaculture, multiple strategies have been actively explored such as vaccines , biological control , antimicrobial peptides , medicinal herbs extract and nanoparticles . However, none of these strategies meet the requirement for antibiotic substitution up to date.It is highly desired that antibiotic substitutes in aquaculture have broad spectrum activity, potent activity against drug-resistant bacteria, low cost in production, excellent biocompatibility, and', ""activity against drug-resistant bacteria, low cost in production, excellent biocompatibility, and most critically fully biodegradability to give degraded products that completely lose antibacterial activity and will not cause antimicrobial selective pressure in organisms and the environments. It's worth mentioning that degradable antibacterial polymers have been studied, such as the acrylate copolymers degradable in aqueous solution into lower molecular weight oligomers that have decreased antibacterial activity , antibacterial polyionenes degradable rapidly at pH 10 and slowly under neutral or acidic conditions , and antibacterial polycarbonate degradable under physiological conditions . However, degradable antimicrobials as need for antibiotic substitution in aquaculture refer to antimicrobials that are fully degradable to very basic components such as single amino acid in relative short period, rather than degradable to large fragments because large fragments can still have moderate antibacterial activity to cause antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial selective pressure.Colistin is a representative host defense peptide (HDP) that has ever been used as an animal feed additive for many years. At present, colistin has been banned as a feed additive in China and Thailand because colistin cannot be completely degraded by enzymes existing in the environment and animals, and the use of colistin in feed is found to accelerate the dissemination of the first mobile mechanism of colistin resistance, termed MCR-1, in animals and then in human beings .

The biodegradability of peptide polymers enabled their enzymatic degradation to single amino acids and dipeptides, which has no antibacterial activity and will not induce antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial selective pressure.

Owing to the synergistic effect of the AIE-molecular rotors (PE) and ACQ-based chromophore units (carbazole), JUC-557-nanosheet demonstrates high absolute quantum yields (up to 23.0%) in both solid-state and solution. Also, electron-rich carbazole and electron-deficient cyan are uniformly distributed and exposed on the channel wall, rendering efficient combining with the analytes for detection. Therefore, JUC-557nanosheet as a sensitive fluorescence sensor exhibits an excellent molecular recognition toward the essential element in the human body (Fe 3+ with K a of 1.98 \uf0b4 10 4 M -1 and LOD of 706 ppb), radioactive contaminant (I 2 with K a of 2.10 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and LOD of 302 ppb), explosive (TNT with K a of 4.38 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and LOD of 129 ppb), and especially toxic nitro-compounds (such as NB with K a of 6.18 \uf0b4 10 6 M -1 and LOD of 5 ppb), which is far superior to previous fluorescence detection materials, including COFs, MOFs, POPs, small molecule probes, and inorganics.

The obvious change of UV-vis absorption band of JUC-557-nanosheet caused by the addition of I 2 was observed, indicating the formation of a nonemissive complex (Supplementary Fig. ).

The K a value of JUC-557-nanosheet with I 2 in seawater was estimated to be 1.27 × 10 5 M -1 , which is slightly lower than that from pure I 2 because organics in seawater could partially react with iodine. Furthermore, I 2 vapor can be quickly detected based on the fluorescence quenching of JUC-557-nanosheet, and the quenching percentage was almost up to 90% within only 30 s (Fig. ).

To account for static offsets we recognise that the background decay parameter, 𝑘, for a given sample is dependent only on the fraction of spins in the sample excited by the pump pulse. All DEER and DEERATom traces recorded with the same pump pulse should have the same background decay parameter, allowing the offsets to be isolated.

Our experimental setup shows a linear relationship between amplitude and nutation frequency up to a pulse amplitude of 30% (Figure ). The linear regime may extend above 30%, but a precise determination of the upper limit was not possible between 30% and 60% due to strong nuclear ESEEM oscillations caused by hyperfine coupling to 1 H nuclei in the protonated solvent matrix.By ensuring that the total amplitude of all pulses fired simultaneously stays within the linear region, distortions to pulse shapes should be minimised.

By incrementing the inter-pulse delay 𝜏, the intensity of the echo generated by the DFHE sequence should oscillate with frequency 𝜔 )* . This experiment is analogous to the 2P-ESEEM experiment (Figure ), and so in addition to the desired inter-electron oscillation the recorded echo intensity will decay due to decoherence and may also be modulated by electron-nuclear couplings.

448,"IntroductionMolecular mechanics (MM) force fields for biomolecular simulations have been under continuous development for many years. In traditional transferable force fields, every atom in a molecule is assigned a type based on its atomic number, bonding and local chemical environment. The atom type then dictates the parameters that are used to model that atom's interactions. The force field parameters for each atom type are stored as a library, which is built by carefully reproducing the experimental or quantum mechanical properties of a benchmark set of small molecules. Due to the infeasibility of accurately parameterizing all of chemical space, a balance must be made between the size of the library and potential inaccuracy due to transferring parameters to molecules outside the fitting set. In many cases, it is acknowledged that transferable force fields are not sufficiently accurate. When building force fields for small molecules, the atomic charges are usually assigned in a system-specific or ""bespoke"" manner, using methods such as RESP, CM1, or AM1-BCC. This is because it is well-known that atomic charges polarize in response to their chemical environment (for example, the presence of electron",Causal,Why are atomic charges usually assigned in a system-specific or 'bespoke' manner when building force fields for small molecules?,Atomic charges are usually assigned in a system-specific or 'bespoke' manner when building force fields for small molecules because it is well-known that atomic charges polarize in response to their chemical environment.,Easy,"[""When building force fields for small molecules, the atomic charges are usually assigned in a system-specific or 'bespoke' manner, using methods such as RESP, CM1, or AM1-BCC.

In this work, we look to challenge this assumption by deriving system-specific non-bonded parameters, from linear-scaling QM simulations, for consistency with the QUBE small molecule force field. These non-bonded terms were used here alongside libraries of (non-bespoke) bond and angle parameters, derived using the modified Seminario method, and newly reparametrized torsional terms.We have shown here that using system-specific non-bonded force field parameters can result in accurate conformational preferences for short peptides. Rotamer populations and simulated J couplings for the dipeptide molecules are in good agreement with experimental data and compare favorably with the latest OPLS force field. For longer peptide molecules, the problems associated with fitting torsional parameters to a system-specific force field became more apparent. Using regularization in the fitting process was shown to overcome these issues and resulted in a J coupling error of just 0.90 ± 0.03 for the alanine pentapeptide. Further work investigating disordered peptides will ascertain how general this fix is.The accuracy of the peptide simulations supports the use of our non-bonded and modified Seminario bonded parametrization strategies. In protein MD simulations, the RMSD of the backbone atoms relative to experimental structures remained low, below 2 Å, for two of the five proteins tested. The α-helices present in all of the proteins generally remained close to the experimental structures, but the β-sheets exhibited', 'density partitioning recreate the underlying QM electrostatic potential with high accuracy, and that charges derived for a NMR ensemble of BPTI protein structures are not too conformation-dependent (standard deviations per residue less than 0.04 e). This is in contrast to the performance of RESP charges, which have been shown to be significantly more conformation-dependent for an ensemble of polypeptide structures. Additional simulations demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of deriving bespoke parameters for a protein-ligand complex. The computed relative binding free energy of indole and benzofuran to the lysozyme protein using the environment-specific force fields (-0.4 kcal/mol) was in excellent agreement with experiment (-0.6 kcal/mol), and was substantially more accurate than standard force fields (-2.4 kcal/mol). However, the force field was in need of further development as the bespoke non-bonded terms were used in combination with standard OPLS-AA bonded parameters.The use of these parameters potentially limits the accuracy of the force field due to interdependency between the bonded terms, particularly the torsional parameters, and the non-bonded components of the force field. This issue is the subject of the current paper.In standard transferable force fields, the torsional component is typically parameterized using QM dihedral energy scans, with the difference between analogous MM and QM energy scans minimized by fitting the torsional parameters. Reparameterization of the torsional terms has been shown to be a crucial step in improving the accuracy of force fields and this has recently been demonstrated for AMBER ff15ipq, CHARMM36 and OPLS-AA/M. Bond and angle reparameterization has also been shown to be', 'charges polarize in response to their chemical environment (for example, the presence of electron donating or withdrawing groups). Bespoke charges are usually assumed to be compatible with the fixed Lennard-Jones parameters of the force field, although these themselves have also been shown to be dependent on the local environment of the atom. Although proteins must also experience polarization effects in both the charges and Lennard-Jones parameters, protein force field parameters have always, to date, been assigned from a transferable library. This leads to an inconsistency in the parametrization strategy used for protein force fields and bespoke small molecule force fields. This is potentially problematic when studying properties that depend on the electrostatic potentials of proteins, such as their interactions with small molecules, and there is no clear way around this using traditional force field fitting methods.To improve the consistency between charge and Lennard-Jones parameters, and also reduce the reliance on fitting to experimental data, one could either directly fit non-bonded MM parameters to reproduce quantum mechanical (QM) energies and forces, or derive the non-bonded parameters of the force field directly from QM. In the latter approach, the QM interaction energy may be broken down into physically motivated components using intermolecular perturbation theory, though these methods are limited to quite small system sizes.', 'which would be problematic if the charges show strong conformation dependence. However, Manz and Sholl have demonstrated that DDEC charges are transferable between different conformations of a molecule (as measured by their ability to recreate the QM electrostatic potential), and they conclude that the charges are suitable for the construction of flexible force fields. Furthermore, it should be noted that atoms-in-molecule electron density partitioning lends itself naturally to the derivation of both off-site charges to model electron anisotropy (such as lone pairs and σ-holes) and atomic polarizabilities, though we have not yet investigated a fully polarizable force field.In keeping with our goal of deriving force field parameters directly from QM, rather than fitting to experiment, we have supplemented the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameters with harmonic bond and angle parameters derived directly from the QM Hessian matrix. There are a number of methods available for deriving bonded parameters from the QM Hessian matrix, but our recent adaptation of the Seminario method (which we name the modified Seminario method) is conceptually quite straightforward whilst yielding parameters that reproduce QM vibrational frequencies with a mean unsigned error of 49 cm -1 , below that of OPLS (59 cm -1 ). Collectively, we have named these methods the QUantum mechanical BEspoke (QUBE) force field. This name reflects the fact that force field parameters are derived by the user specifically for the small molecule under study, directly from QM calculations. We have released a software toolkit (QUBEKit) that facilitates the derivation of small organic molecule force field parameters, and also', 'Non-bonded ParametersThe non-bonded components of a molecular mechanics force field aim to describe the quantum mechanical electrostatic, dispersion and exchange-repulsion interactions in a computationally efficient manner. The charge parameters are generally fit to the quantum mechanical electrostatic potential of small molecules. The Lennard-Jones parameters are then fit to reproduce experimental data, such as liquid densities and heats of vaporization. The aim of QUBE is to move away from the requirement for transferable force field parameters, and instead to derive bespoke parameters for molecules directly from QM calculations. First, a QM simulation of the molecule under study is performed. From the output of the QM calculation, the total electron density of the molecule is partitioned onto individual atoms using an atoms-in-molecule (AIM) weighting scheme. There is no unique method to perform this partitioning, but we favor the density derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) scheme, which is a weighted combination of the iterative stockholder atoms and iterative Hirshfeld approaches. With the electron density partitioned to individual atoms, the atom-centered charges can be simply found by integrating the electron density over all space (and adding the nuclear charge). We have implemented the DDEC approach in the ONETEP software package, which allows us to perform QM calculations of, and assign parameters to, systems comprising thousands of atoms.

To further characterize the electronic character of bisaminoterphenylphosphine ligands DFT calculations were carried out to determine the theoretical TEP-value (TEPNi,theo) of bisaminoterphenylphosphines 1.

These Buchwald-type ligands with flanking mesityl groups have been shown to possess attractive interactions between the gold center and one of the flanking mesityl groups, as was ascertained by determination of the molecular structures of a series of gold complexes 2, 3, 4 and 5.The percent buried volume of 1b amounts to ca. 55% and a linear fit of known TEP-values with their respective gas phase structures (obtained by DFT studies) revealed that particularly 1b can be classified as electron-rich phosphine and their application in the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes was tested. Preparing catalyst solutions by chloride ion abstraction from 2 with AgX salts, sometimes the formation of the respective dimeric Ag-complexes [(L)Ag-µ-Cl]2 6a and 6b was noted, which were independently synthesized. This is another example that AgCl contamination can result in erroneous catalyst screening results. Screening of the catalytic reaction conditions showed efficient hydroamination to take place at 60°C in MeCN with a catalyst loading of 4 of 1 mol% and moderate to excellent yields were achieved for bulky anilines such as Dip-NH2 and different phenyl acetylene derivatives. No obvious difference in performance between ligands 1a and 1b was noted. In summary, terphenylbisaminophosphines meet the criteria of efficient ligands for intermolecular gold-catalyzed hydroamination reactions, as they combine strong donor properties with the 2-biphenyl structural motif, which is needed to enhance complex stability during catalysis.', '[BF4] -anion (Figure , right). Additionally, we treated 2a with AgPF6 in CH2Cl2, added an excess of pyridine and the mixture was stirred overnight. Upon removal of the solvent and excess pyridine, X-Ray quality crystals were obtained from a saturated CH2Cl2 solution layered with nhexane. In analogy to complex 4a the base adduct, pyridine in this case, of the cationic gold complex was obtained with a noncoordinating [PF6] -anion in [TerP(NMe2)2Au(py)][PF6] (5a). In 4a and 5a the Au-P distances are similar to complexes 2 [P1-Au1 (4a) 2.2376(5); (5a) 2.247(3) Å; cf. (TerPMe2)AuCl 2.2964(10) Å] and two contacts with the flanking mesityl group below 3.1 Å are detected in the base-stabilized cations. Overall, the structural parameters clearly show that the terphenyl structural motif gives rise to stabilizing Au-arene interactions, which should prove beneficial in catalytic trials, as was shown by Xu and co-workers in terms of complex stability in intermolecular hydroamination reactions. Preparing complexes 3-5, sometimes the formation of a new species characterized by a doublet of doublets in the 31 P NMR spectrum was noted. This species was only observed if AgCl was not completely removed during filtration and when the solution was kept in daylight. In one instance we obtained X-ray quality crystals that were identified as the neutral silver chloride complex [(1a)AgCl ]2 (6a).

The Au-P distance is shorter than in 2a and 2b [(3b) P1-Au1 2.2187(4) Å], hinting at a more positive Au-center. This increase is further supported by two close contacts between gold and one of the flanking mesityl groups [C7-Au1 3.0506( ), C8-Au1 2.9955( ) Å].

In a subsequent study, we preselected docking areas by filtering the distance from the metal to the β-carbon of the amino acids Asp, His, Glu and Cys, using a range from 2.5 to 5.0 Å. Both works showed that few geometric descriptors related to the backbone of the protein afford with convenient information to predict metalbinding sites rather than focusing only on the first coordination sphere donors (mainly side chains) that coordinate the metal.BioMetAll represents a major step forward in how to predict metal-binding sites in proteins. The approach stands on the geometric information extracted from a collection of about 171000 biological complexes to infer a combination of geometric rules that are used to evaluate the regions of a protein for metal binding. The program accurately reproduces the experimental metal-binding motifs on a benchmark of 53 structures. Furthermore, we present three specific case studies to illustrate its potential. BioMetAll is efficient to i) predict metal-binding sites with particular amino acid motifs even for non-canonical metal coordinating amino acids and backbone atoms; ii) determine transient metal-binding sites in structures that need conformational changes to reach the complete coordination sphere, which could be related to metal diffusion pathways; and even iii) predict potential mutations of an existing protein to generate convenient metal-binding sites. This new approach can make a significant contribution to future development in fields like metalloenzyme and metallodrug design.', 'Statistical analysisWe analyzed the entire bunch of the structures available in the MetalPDB, a publicly accessible database of preselected metalcontaining proteins from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This analysis was carried out thanks to an in-house PyChimera script applied on ca. 171000 metal-binding sites. It ended up with a list of ca. 500000 entries (Table ) after cleaning the database from metaldonor distances lower than 1.5 Å or greater than 3.0 Å. From the 500000 entries, a range of values was obtained for each geometric feature Ma, Mb, Mab (Table , Figure ). For histidine, the subranges obtained for Hisẟ and Hisε tautomers were merged. Although the analysis of coordination by backbone atoms was undertaken for each amino acid, the final results (Table ) presented a large overlap. In consequence, a global range for MO and MOC was considered for all the entries: MO, distance metalbackbone oxygen from 1.809 Å to 3.000 Å; and MOC, angle metalbackbone oxygen -backbone carbon from 1.774 Rad to 3.139 Rad.Further analyses were conducted to provide a series of default parameters for a prototypical prediction. It first emerges that 80% of donor atoms are part of the side chains (Table ), and 19% are part of the backbone (Table ). Default calculations in BioMetAll were therefore set to look for side chains primarily and left backbone coordination as optional. For side chains, the 89% of coordinating atoms comes from what we called canonical metal coordinating amino acids namely Asp, His, Glu and Cys while a 10.9% belongs to non-canonical amino acids (Asn, Thr,', 'of mutations. This run of BioMetAll looking for possible sites allowing a mutation to either Asp or Glu provided with an extensive list of possible solutions including Asn131 (Table ). The following step was a post-process by filtering the solutions that show collapse between the probes and any amino acid side chain or backbone from close neighbors of the putative metal-binding areas. This filtering process together with a visual inspection diminished the number of possibilities to five candidates (Table and Figure ).To further assess the predictiveness of BioMetAll under a metalloenzyme design framework, the predicted systems were used as a starting point for docking experiments. Calculations were carried out with the protein-ligand docking software GOLD software and repeated inside our GaudiMM platform (to provide with a freeware alternative). Both calculations were performed The predictiveness of BioMetAll is excellent and compares very well with other algorithms when it comes to determine metal-binding sites as well as the exact list of the amino acids involved in the coordination motifs. Those predictions are of good quality even when exogenous compounds are involved. BioMetAll tests on several key systems show that i) it efficiently predicts primary as well as secondary metal-binding sites, ii) it can easily account on how the conformational changes of the protein could alter the formation of metal-binding sites, iii) it allows to work with common metal-binding templates as well as non-standard ones, iv) it identifies sites even with incomplete coordination spheres, and v) it allows to predict mutations that could be necessary to generate new metal-binding sites in a protein', 'of the protein side chain for the metal to bind including transient geometries that require conformational changes or modification of the coordination environment (vacant sites, presence of labile ligands etc…) for the metal to bind.In recent years, our group has actively worked in areas where it was essential to predict with confidence those amino acids that could coordinate metal compounds either for proteins or peptides. In those works, we frequently confront with new-to-Nature metal-binding sites, X-ray structures of proteins without a well-defined binding site or even putative binding sites of metallodrugs. Part of our efforts allowed us to develop a series of docking approaches that can well reproduce low energy poses of metal-protein complexes. However, such approaches are only viable if good guesses for metal-binding regions are accessible on the first hand. For this aspect, in a first statistical analysis about ten years ago, we observed that i) any amino acid with its ⍺-carbon located within a sphere up to 7-9 Å could potentially be considered as a metal ligand (obviously considering possible coordination by residues with long side chains like lysine or tyrosine) and ii) the center of mass of the coordinating residues generally does not stand far from the exact position of the metal ions observed in the', 'of the X-ray structures to be found in the most populated solution only with the complete set of amino acids, success rate falls to 40%. Obviously, like for other techniques based on empirical scores, the predictiveness of the method cannot be limited to the best solution only and those secondary metal binding sites that BioMetAll detects are not necessarily false positives but transient metallic environments accessible to the protein (see our first application case on HSA). Energetic terms and other physico-chemical magnitudes that are not present in BioMetAll, could dictate the fine structure of the metal-binding site. Posterior filtering could be necessary depending on the objective of its use.The accuracy of the predicted binding area was further assessed by measuring the distance from the experimental metal position to the nearest computed probe. On average a difference between calculated and experimental positions of the metal is about 0.56 ± 0.19 Å. Importantly, such quality is not influenced by the presence of donors coordinated to the metal provided by exogenous compounds (e.g. phosphate or water molecules). In these cases, we generally observe a displacement to the limits of the predicted region (Figure ), suggesting that the exogenous donors only slightly modify the position of the metal and the organization of the side chains.Because calculations are performed in a blind manner, meaning that all the system is screened for predicting metal-binding sites, these results are quite remarkable. Regarding the computational cost of the calculations, they range from 3s to 245s, with a median of 18s (with the size of the system highly correlating with the computational time r=0.89, p<0.0001).The benchmark shows that BioMetAll is a suitable software to predict metal-binding sites.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSIn this contribution, we presented the implementation of the Davidson algorithm and its variational variant within the quantum version of EOM-CC for computing electronically excited states. We tested the method, named qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson and qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson/Variational, on four systems: H 2 /6-31G, H 4 /STO-3G, LiH/STO-3G, and H 2 O/STO-3G(FC) showing good agreements with the energies obtained from EOM-VQE .The Davidson implementation of the qEOM-UCCSD algorithm provides the advantage over the qEOM and EOM-VQE by reducing the working Hilbert space significantly. The classic Davidson method iteratively interacts with the outcome from the quantum devices and provides feedback to grow the ansatz (vector space) to prepare desired quantum states.The implementation provides several advantages compared to the currently available excitedstate methods in quantum computing. First, qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson significantly reduces the computational demand for classical diagonalization step, because the dimension of the resulting subspace Hamiltonian only spanned by a few guess vectors. In the case of its variational variant, the Davidson algorithm provides the certain electronic configurations that are expected to contribute to the target excited states. Therefore, it introduces a significantly smaller number of variational parameters resulting in a significantly reduced searching space.In addition, similarly to the classical variant, the presented Davidson algorithm produces the excited state of the desired spatial or spin symmetry (in the case of the closed-shell references). The qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson can target the specific group of transitions by defining suitable subspace vectors and can be extended to target higher-energy states or specific transitions . Apart from the advantages of using', 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b41"">[42] . The focus of this paper is on the incorporation of the Davidson procedure into the qEOM protocol, which we call the qEOM-UCC/Davidson algorithm. The key feature of the Davidson implementation on quantum devices is the design of a unitary ansatz that generates specific quantum superposition states, which is achieved by using Gray code decomposition . The proposed ansatz enables targeting a specific subspace within the Hilbert space based on the feedback from the Davidson procedure. Hence, instead of computing the entire eigen-spectrum of the Hamiltonian, our qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson algorithm is capable of computing several transitions of a particular type by defining suitable subspace vectors. Here we focus on finding low-lying states of a given symmetry/spin, but the algorithm can be easily extended to finding states around the specified energy or of a particular type (e.g., such as excitations between specific orbitals).The structure of the paper is as follows: Sec. II A discusses EOM formalism, Sec. II B describes the choice of the ground-state ansatz for quantum computing and its incorporation within EOM, Sec. II C explains the Davidson procedure with qEOM implemented on quantum devices, Sec. II D presents the detailed circuit design, and Sec. III presents the variational extension of the proposed algorithm. Sec. IV provides computational details of illustrative calculations and Sec. V presents the numerical results using a set of small molecules (H 2 , H 4 , LiH, and H 2 O). Sec. VI gives our concluding remarks.', 'standard EOM-CCSD, it scales as ∼ O(n 6 ) . Hence, the major advantage of using quantum devices stems from the efficient evaluation of σ-vectors giving rise to the efficient evaluation of matrix elements of H. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the deviation of the approximate eigenvectors, |c k ⟩, from the true eigenvectors by computing the residual vectors|r k ⟩ = ( H -λ k )|c k ⟩ = L i=1 c k i ( H -λ k )|b i ⟩, k = 1, • • • , J.(28)As per Eq. ( ), the residual vectors are zero for the true eigenvectors. The convergence is assessed by the norm of residual vectors, which also can be measured on quantum devices.The residual vectors |r k ⟩ are linear combinations of excited Slater determinants. Thus, the evaluation of the norms of residual vectors is equivalent to probing the composition of residual vectors, i.e., measurements of overlaps between excited Slater determinants and residual vectors||r k || = N µ=1 |⟨Φ µ |r k ⟩| 2 . (29)Note that {c k i } L,J i=1,k=1 , {λ k } J k=1 , and {b i } L i=1 of Eq. ( ) are already known from the previous steps. Therefore, the qEOM-UCC/Davidson only measures the overlap between Slater determinants and σ-vectors ⟨Φ µ |σ i ⟩. The final step of the qEOM-UCC/Davidson algorithm is the orthonormalization of the residual vectors to the current set of guess vectors and expansion of the vector space with the (orhtonormalized) residuals. This can be done by the Gram-Schmidt procedure on classical computers:<formula', 'Two algorithms for excited-states quantum solvers: Theory and application to EOM-UCCSD Near-term quantum devices promise to revolutionize quantum chemistry, but simulations with the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are not practical due to their high susceptibility to errors. This motivated the design of NISQ algorithms that leverage classical and quantum resources. While several developments have shown promising results for ground-state simulations, extending the algorithms to excited states remains challenging. This paper presents two costefficient excited-state algorithms inspired by the classic Davidson algorithm. We implemented the Davidson method into the quantum version of the equation-of-motion unitary coupled-cluster (qEOM-UCC) excited-state method adapted for quantum hardware. The circuit strategies to generate desired excited states are discussed, implemented, and tested. We demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the proposed algorithms (qEOM-UCC/Davidson and its variational variant) by simulations of H 2 , H 4 , LiH, and H 2 O molecules. Similarly to the classic Davidson scheme, the qEOM-UCC/Davidson algorithms are capable of targeting a small number of excited states of the desired character.', 'C. Solving qEOM-UCCSD on quantum computers using a Davidson-like procedureSimilar to the classical electronic-structure calculations, the quantum version of EOM (qEOM) protocol computes ground state before solving the EOM problem by using variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with the choice of an appropriate ansatz, such as unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) and Hardware-efficient ansatz .

In contrast to quantum chemical calculations of whole molecules and applying them as molecular descriptors, the generation of quantum atom pairs is a rapid and easy process.Although boosting standard atom pairs with quantum information, the number of quantum atom pairs is limited and further research to overcome the problem should be conducted.A possible solution could be the creation of a larger database of quantum properties that would contain molecules build of more chemical elements than QM9-extended-plus database.Other modifications of the quantum atom pairs could be achieved by calculating more than 1 .1a sum of the quantum properties of atom pairs present in the molecule -11 descriptors (sumQAP), 2. a sum of the histograms of the atom pairs -110 descriptors per molecule (hQAP), 3. a vector of quantum properties of atom pairs -11979 values (spQAP) Figure 1 :Figure 2 :12Figure 1: R of regression tasks modelling.

This may indicate that the addition of quantum information to atom pairs is more effective in regression tasks.', 'Quantum informed atom pairsTo enrich atom pairs with quantum-chemical properties, 1089 unique atom pairs of distance of up to 4 bonds were generated from QM9-extended-plus database. Based on the set of unique atom pairs, two different approaches to define quantum atom pairs (QAP) were undertaken.In the first definition, every atom pair was assigned with arithmetic means of quantum properties of all molecules containing the atom pair. In the case of multiple occurrences of an atom pair in the molecule, the property value was divided by the number of occurrences.Since there are 11 quantum properties in the quantum properties database, every atom pair was related with 11 values.The alternative definition was to generate 10 binned histograms out of the values of quantum properties of molecules containing specific atom pair, divided by the number of occurrences of the atom pair. As a result, 110 different values were assigned to atom pairs. The nature of modified atom pairs makes them highly dependent on the composition of the quantum properties database which impacts the applicability domain of QAP. Due to the narrow group of elements present in the QM9-extended-plus database, atom pairs are limited to C, O, N, F, S, Cl, and Br elements. The limitation transfers to the applicability domain. In the research molecules containing only atom pairs from the set generated from the QM9-extended-plus database were curated from experimental databases.From the aforementioned QAPs, three sets of molecular descriptors were generated: ', ""Results and discussionThe results indicate that in most cases QAPs provide enough information to yield predictions more accurate than the baseline. Among designed QAPs, spQAPs proved to be the most informative, thus this type of representation was investigated the most. It appears that in some cases enriching atom pairs with information derived from quantum chemistry improves the accuracy of the models relative to traditional atom pairs.Considering regression tasks, based on figures 1 and 2 representing R 2 and RMSE respectively, the overall impression is that the best models' performance is achieved with molecular descriptors, then spQAP and then unmodified atom pairs. Only in the case of predicting pIC50, the most informative molecular representation were atom pairs. Another exception was ionization energy, as Morgan fingerprints and RDKit fingerprints were better suited to create structure-property relationships.In order to gain more insight into the differences in metrics obtained with spQAP and atom pairs, the relative metrics were calculated as the ratio of metric value obtained with spQAP to the value obtained with atom pairs minus 1. The ratio was calculated for each cross validation fold and visualized in figures 3 and 4. The quantum modification of atom pairs caused an average value of R 2 increase from 0.5% to 6% and the RMSE decreased about 0.5% to 5% depending on the predicted property.

The convergence of the correlation energy is not so certain, and can be improved in three ways: i) by calculating correlation at a higher level of theory, ii) by using a larger basis set or adding diffuse and/or midpoint functions, or iii) by correlating all electrons in the calculation. Higher level correlation in dispersiondominated complexes of similar interaction energies was studied by Řezač and Hobza: the CCSDT(Q) correction to a CCSD(T) energy accounts for only 1-3% of the interaction energy. Due to the enormous computational cost of CCSDT(Q) calculations, we currently cannot investigate higher order effects on this system. Basis set incompleteness at the CCSD(T)/ [3,4]-ζ level is about ∼50 mÅ in the very weakly bound Ar• • •Ar complex, and decreases to ∼5 mÅ for a more strongly bound complex, such as NH 3 • •HF. The effect of increasing basis set size in the δ(T) component of the MP2+δ(T) recipe is shown in Fig. , in the left panel. Note that the O=C••S angle in the r (2) m structure ( ) is adjusted here by assuming the OCS monomer is linear. With increasing basis set size ( ), the intermonomer distance hardly changes, and the main difference is in the O=C••Xe angle. This further confirms that the structure is likely', ""Elst ( )IndFor the other complexes, the use of the 3-ζ basis sets in the literature and SAPT data introduces a basis set incompleteness error. The MP2+δ(T) values reported here should be of significantly higher accuracy:the energies are calculated at the respective fully-relaxed minima, and the correlation is obtained from larger basis sets, as well as extrapolated towards the complete basis set limit. A set of experimental estimates of the binding energy is obtained from experimental rotational constants (B, C) and is also shown in Table . A diatomic approximation is used to estimate the force constant between the two monomers (k s ) from the centrifugal distortion constant (Eq. ( )). Then this force constant is used to fit a Lennard-Jones model (Eq.

While the R 2 cm should be derived from the equilibrium geometries, , see Table in the Supporting information. The rotational and centrifugal constants are taken from the original publications. Where necessary, the constants are refit with Watson's S-reduced Hamiltonian 42 using Kisiel's Convc"", '( 2 )2m and r SE e results. This could be an incompatibility of the cc-pwcV[TQ]Z-PP basis sets used for the frozen-core components with the all-electron TZP basis set used to calculate the δ AE FC (as AE-CCSD(T)/TZP -FC-CCSD(T)/TZP). An all-electron 4-ζ CCSD(T) geometry optimisation is currently prohibitively expensive. On the right panel of Fig. 7 we illustrate the effect relativistic corrections have on the potential energy surface, as well as on the minimum structures. By adding 4-th order corrections using the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian to the MP2+δ(T) potential, we obtain a global minimum that is within 10 mÅ of the r (2) m structure. The O=C••Xe angle is also essentially the same when a linear OCS is assumed in the r (2) m structure. However, it is worth noting that the relativistic effects are double counted in the right panel of Fig. 7: both scalar as well as spin-orbit effects are incorporated into the Xe effective core potentials, 25 the addition of the Douglas-Kroll-Hess correction treats the scalar relativistic effects a second time. These results confirm relativistic effects play an important role in the stabilisation of the Xe• • •OCS complex, but the agreement of the MP2+δ(T)+δ 4 rel results with the r', 'and the main difference is in the O=C••Xe angle. This further confirms that the structure is likely near convergence with respect to basis set size.We have investigated two additional basis set effects: counterpoise correction for the basis set superposition error, and the effect of diffuse functions. The former has no significant effect on the structure, as the difference in the monomer separation obtained from MP2+δ(T) and CP-MP2+δ(T) is only 0.001 Å. On the other hand, the aug-MP2+δ(T) structure obtained with cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z basis sets augmented by diffuse functions (see in Fig. ) is remarkably close to the experimental r(2) m structure, with a disagreement in the monomer separation of only 15 mÅ. While this is most certainly a step in the direction, the increased computational cost compared to cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z calculations is immense: the augmentation of the basis set increases the number of basis functions by 20%, and the amount of memory required for the computation of the connected triples (ie. the (T) component) more than doubles.

We conducted the reaction between styrene 1a and reagent I in MeCN at room temperature under blue LED irradiation using cyanoarene 12 derivatives as organophotocatalyst instead of using the iridium-based photocatalyst employed by the Hopkinson and Glorius groups. To our delight, 2.5 mol% of PC1 (4CZIPN) furnished the desired vinyl-SCF3 product 2a in 50% yield (Table , entry 1). Encouraged by this first test, we evaluated other cynaoarene organophotocatalysts. The desired product was observed with PC2, PC3 and PC4 albeit with lower efficiency than with PC1 ). Afterwards, the use of other chloro and iodo ammonium salts also furnished desired product 2a but in only 30% yield (Table ). Using sodium bromide instead of tetra-butylammonium bromide afforded similar yield (Table ). Thus, due to its cost-effectiveness, NaBr was used for the rest of the optimisation. Then, the effect of solvent was studied. While DMF afforded desired product 2a in 40% (Table ), other solvents including toluene, ether, or DCM only provided marginal yields (Table , entries 9-11).

To further confirm the need for light, On/Off experiments were conducted and confirmed the stepwise mechanism involved in this transformation (see ESI for details) Scheme 5. Proposed mechanism for the synthesis of vinyl-SCF3 Afterwards, to further exploit the reactivity of reagent I, we decided to investigate the synthesis of benzoyl-SCF3 derivatives under organophotoredox conditions. Access to such compounds has already been demonstrated by reacting Munavalli's reagent and aldehydes under photochemical conditions. Indeed, while the Glorius 15 group reported a dual strategy using an iridium-based photocatalyst in conjunction with catalytic amount of sodium benzoate under blue LED König and co-workers employed decatungstate as photocatalyst under 385 nm LED irradiation. Inspired by these studies, we reacted reagent I and aldehyde 3a in MeCN in the presence of 5 mol% of organophotocatalyst PC1 and 5 mol% of sodium benzoate (PhCOONa) at room temperature under blue LED irradiation. Under these conditions, desired product 4a was obtained in an excellent yield of 97% (Scheme 6). Then, we investigated the scope of the reaction by functionalising several aryl aldehydes bearing different functional groups. Pleasingly, both electron donating and electron-withdrawing groups were tolerated under the reaction conditions affording the desired products in excellent yield (up to 91%, compounds 4b-4f, Scheme 6). In contrast, using 2-naphthaldeyde provided the desired product in a low yield of 22% (compounds 4g, Scheme 6). Interestingly chlorine or bromine atoms on the aldehyde starting material were tolerated and the desired products were obtained in 76% and 85%, respectively (products 4h and 4i, Scheme 6).

The reaction mixture was stirred under blue LED irradiation for 16 hours unless otherwise noted. Isolated yields. Upon addition of styrene 1a to the previous reaction mixture, we detected the formation of two adducts reinforcing the formation of the trifluoromethylthio radical intermediate (g=2.006, aN=13.3G and aH=13.3G, a3F=1.9G, present in 81%) as well as a C-centred radical species that could potentially match with structure B (g=2.0056, aN=15.4G and aH=19.7G, present in 11%) (Scheme 4, 2).To get more insight on the reaction mechanism, we performed cyclic voltammetry studies. Herein, addition of one equivalent of sodium bromide shifted the potential of reagent I from -1.97 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) to -1.74 V. This shift confirms the requirement for bromide salt to be used for the reaction to proceed (see optimisation table) and could be associated to the formation of a new adduct . We suggest that the activation of reagent I with bromide anion could likely lead to the in situ formation of BrSCF3 as mentioned in previous studies reported by and Glorius. Based on the mechanism already proposed by Hopkinson and Glorius and our preliminary EPR and cyclic voltammetry investigations, we propose the following mechanism could take place under the reaction conditions. Activation of reagent I with bromide anion leads to the in situ formation of BrSCF3. The exited photocatalyst PC1 reduces this intermediate affording a radical anion that can deliver the key SCF3 radical intermediate. This radical then adds onto the styrene derivative to provide C-centred radical C as demonstrated by EPR.

This set is termed AS23 (Absolute Entropy) from now on and is described also in the Supporting Information. The corresponding experimental gas phase reference entropies and C p (T ) values are taken from Refs. 78,79. Studies are available in the literature presenting much larger collections of experimental reference data, e.g., in Ref.55. However, these databases contain mostly small, rather rigid systems (e.g., substituted aromatic compounds) which are not in the focus of our study. Nonetheless, thecombined LBH and AS23 sets should sufficiently representative for benchmarking absolute entropies. To show possible limitations of our approach a set of maximally flexible linear alkanes (up to C 18 H 38 ) is investigated separately. Table 1 :1Contributions to the total molecular entropy for n-decane and tamiflu. RRHO and msRRHO values correspond to the B97-3c level of theory, S conf and S msRRHO were calculated at the GFN2-xTB level.

Contributions from translational and rotational DOF', '-1 and SDs from 1.08 to 1.30 cal mol -1 K -1 respectively, depending on the combination of the DFT method with either GFN2-xTB or GFN-FF. Heat capacities were assessed on a set of linear and branches alkanes at different temperatures. The MAD and SD values are with 0.5 cal mol -1 K -1 even smaller than for absolute entropies but increase at very high temperatures > 800 K. The presented method performs better than related yet computationally sigificantly more costly appoaches and to our knowledge provides the smallest errors for molecular entropies ever reported in the literature. This includes large, extremely flexible n-alkanes up to octadacene for which an unprecedented accuracy for the absolute entropy in comparison to experiment of about 5% was obatained.Biochemically important systems and chemical applications were discussed on the basis of set of 25 drug molecules and four reaction examples, including the calculation of adsorption entropies, two reaction free energies and a non-covalent association free energy calculation.For the drug molecules, a correlation of molecular flexibility and the entropy was observed.The examples revealed a significant contribution of the configurational terms to the overall free energy, often exceeding the magnitude of chemical accuracy. In the future, a more thorough study of these effects across a wide range of chemical reactions is desirable.In general, GFN2-xTB was found to provide (as expected) a more consistent description of the PES and hence the conformational entropy than GFN-FF. However, as calculations of S conf tend to get very expensive for larger systems at GFN2-xTB or higher theoretical levels, GFN-FF is strongly recommended as the standard approach in routine treatments on common desktop computers. In theory, the basic components of the proposed scheme are systematically improvable by a better description of the PES. The modular partition of the absolute value into ro-vibrational and', 'cal mol -1 K -1 , respectively. Though decane (32 atoms) is smaller than the drug molecule tamiflu (50 atoms), their conformational entropy values are rather similar. The simple explanation for this is the higher flexiblity of decane, which is typically indicated by a larger relative contribution of S conf to the absolute entropy for similar sized structures. In general S conf will be close to zero for the most rigid molecules or molecules with only a few distinct conformers, but adds a significant portion (ten or more percent) to the absolute entropy for highly flexible molecules.The last contributrion to S conf is the population average S msRRHO . This term may provide insight about the variation of S msRRHO within the ensemble. It will be small if all contributing conformers have a similar ro-vibrational entropy as the reference structure (e.g. for decane with 0.7 cal mol -1 K -1 ), or yields a large contribution in the opposite case (tamiflu, 2.3 cal mol -1 K -1 ). For the latter, computed msRRHO entropies can vary by several entropy units for different conformations rather independently of the chosen τ or ν scal values. An example is provided in Fig. , where S msRRHO was calculated for 299 (random) conformers of tamiflu at two different theoretical levels (GFN-FF and B97-3c). Here, entropies at the GFN-FF level are overestimated by 4 cal mol -1 K -1 on average compared to the more accurate B97-3c level. Both methods show a similar spread of the S msRRHO values, which range approximately 6 cal mol -1 K -1 from lowest to highest value thus reassureing the use of S msRRHO . Hence, the validity of an approximate S msRRHO obtained at SQM or FF level depends on the performance for relative msRRHO entropies and may be used if a shifted (cf. Eq. 11) population average similar to the higher reference DFT level is expected. Another novelty of our approach is the extrapolation of S conf to the ensemble completeness as', 'tween different reference conformers in S msRRHO and S msRRHO would cancel and lead to the same conformational entropy regardless of the chosen global minimum. This is observed for C 18 H 38 and S conf calculated at the GFN-FF level and would always be the case if S msRRHO (see Eq. 11) is calculated at the same level as S msRRHO . For C 16 H 34 variations between the different theory levels are larger and only the GFN2 conformational entropy for the folded conformer as reference is still within chemical accuracy. Nevertheless, accurate entropies of extremely flexible large alkanes have been consistenly obtained for the first time and this can be considered as a major achievement even though some issues for C 18 H 38 remain. The detailed reasons for the deviations for the ""worst cases"" C 16 H 34 and particularly C 18 H 38 are not fully clear at this point but originate tentatively from the S conf part.Technical size limitations of our approach should also be noted. The computational cost increases strongly with molecule size at high flexibility and can make the conformational entropy calculation unfeasible for larger molecules. At the GFN2 level, the S conf calculation for C 16 H 34 already takes a few hundred hours of computation time, and hence, we did not attempt to calculate C 18 H 38 at this level of theory. With the much cheaper GFN-FF method, on the other hand, the entropy for both C 16 H 34 and C 18 H 38 can still be computed roughly ""over night"" on a standard CPU node with 14 cores. Somewhat larger (up to 100-200 atoms) but less flexible molecules (e.g., typical drugs, see Sec.4.4) are also feasible at the GFN-FF level due to the shorter MD run times required. Neither of these system sizes can routinely be treated by DFT based MF approaches.', 'be associated with large changes of the indvidual conformer populations and may be interpreted as conformational phase transitions. For a more general review of interpretations of PES related heat capacity features see the work of Wales (Ref. 25). The linear chain-like molecules in Fig. (decane, octane and hexanethiol) only have a single maximum in the range 100-200 K. Around 200 K, many folded, higher energetic conformations start to be populated, while at lower temperatures only very linear structures are obtained. The global maximum of C p,conf depends on the molecule specific energetic distribution of the conformers within a given energy window. For example, the CE of hexanethiol and octane consist of about the same number of conformers (150 and 152 structures respectively within 6 kcal mol -1 ), but differ with regard to their relative conformational energies.

Analytical-scale reactions revealed that CitB and ClaD each selectively hydroxylate compounds with a variety of steric and electronic properties (Fig. ).

This model compound maintained the redox-sensitive aldehyde moiety and hydroxyl groups present in the citrinin biosynthetic intermediate (7). This model compound, 16, was completely consumed in 3 h upon exposure to 0.4 mol % CitB in the presence of α-KG, an iron(II) source and sodium ascorbate in 50 mM TES buffer at pH 7.5 (Fig. ). From this reaction, a single benzylic alcohol product (17) was isolated in 82% yield without any evidence of oxidation of either the aldehyde or the resorcinol core. This result demonstrated that CitB could function on a non-native substrate with the robustness needed for preparative-scale synthesis with precise chemo-and site-selectivity. As a comparative measure, we subjected substrate 16 to several chemical oxidation conditions and did not observe conversion to desired benzylic alcohol 17 (see Supporting Information, Table ).

To probe the substrate scope of our biocatalysts beyond resorcinol substrates, phenolic compounds 39 and S5 (see Supporting Information) were subjected to CitB hydroxylation conditions. Phenol 39 was converted to the corresponding benzylic alcohol; however, the position of the hydroxyl group proved to be important for catalysis as phenol S5 was not oxidized by either CitB or ClaD. These results motivated us to synthesize an additional panel of phenolic substrates to further assess the scope of NHI biocatalytic hydroxylation (40-42). In the case of CitB, increasing the steric bulk at the C5 position increased the conversion of substrates to hydroxylated products except for 2-naphthyl substrate 42, which demonstrated decreased conversion, possibly reflecting the steric limitations of the CitB active site. ClaD was unable to hydroxylate phenolic substrates 40-42.As a next step in the evaluation of the synthetic utility of the NHI dioxygenase-catalyzed benzylic C-H hydroxylation, we performed reactions on preparative-scale using whole cell (CitB) and crude cell lysate (ClaD) conditions (Fig. ). This method enabled routine performance of reactions on >500 mg scale without the requirement for protein purification. Isolation and characterization of C5-substituted benzylic alcohol products 17 and 46-48 was achieved with yields that corresponded to starting material consumption. For example, benzylic alcohol 17 was isolated in 82% yield. However, poor isolated yields were obtained for substrates with C6-substituents, despite nearly complete consumption of starting material (see 49-53).

Cox and coworkers demonstrated through in vivo experiments that CitB performs a benzylic hydroxylation in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin citrinin (8, Fig. ).

We anticipated that, following benzylic C-H bond oxidation, an o-QM intermediate (see 12-14 Fig. ) could be accessed and intercepted with a variety of nucleophiles or dienophiles to form benzylic C-O, C-N, C-S, and C-C bonds in a biomimetic fashion.

For example, low-efficiency 'Black Box' systems have an optimal production network with 124 regional production locations with a low capital cost scenario to 32 regional production locations with a high capital cost scenario. In this case, the average production cost for an optimized production and distribution network is between 1,000 USD/t N H 3 with a low capital cost scenario and 1,800 USD/t N H 3 with a high capital cost scenario (Figure ), the average transportation cost is between 90 USD/t N H 3 with a low capital cost scenario and 230 USD/t N H 3 with a high capital cost scenario (Figure ), and average transportation distance is between 1,000 km with a low capital cost scenario and 2,500 km with a high capital cost scenario (Figure ).

Higher discount rates lead to higher ammonia costs, longer distribution distances, larger regional production capacities, and a lower number of production regions. Conversely, lower discount rates result in lower ammonia costs, shorter distribution distances, smaller regional production capacities, and a higher number of production regions. For instance, a low discount rate of 3% results in ammonia costs between 540 USD/t N H 3 and 950 USD/t N H 3 and distribution distances between 510 km and 1,020 km, while a high discount rate of 10% results in ammonia costs between 680 USD/t N H 3 and 1,230 USD/t N H 3 and distribution distances between 660 km and 1,400 km.

Our results show that it is possible to create wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production infrastructure to meet global fertilizer demand while maintaining competitive costs and low water stress. When prioritizing water over cost, it is possible to reduce the average water stress by 99% with only a 1.4% increase in ammonia costs.Our results highlight the benefits of a decarbonized and decentralized ammonia supply chain by showing that the decentralization of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production leads to reduced levels of price sensitivity.

An analysis of three capital cost scenarios evaluates the effect of the discount rate on the average ammonia cost, average distribution distance, optimal number of production regions, and average regional production capacity. Higher discount rates lead to higher ammonia costs, higher distribution distances, higher average regional capacity, and a lower number of production regions.A low discount rate, here considered to be 3%, results in an average ammonia cost of 540 USD/t N H 3 for the low capital cost scenario and 950 USD/t N H 3 for the high capital cost scenario (Figure ).

While 92 to 329 facilities are still centralized, the ability to distribute these facilities across the globe, rather than clustering the facil-ities, reduces the distance between manufacturing locations and farms by nearly three times when compared to current Haber-Bosch facilities, which has a minimum distance between Haber-Bosch locations and farms of 1,250 km. This would aid in increasing access, and would potentially reduce safety issues. An emerging technology that may be able to operate at these energy efficiencies is lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction.

A decentralized production infrastructure results in shorter transportation distances and therefore lower distribution costs. Furthermore, decentralized production could lead to improved resiliency to the failure of production nodes.An analysis of six energy efficiency scenarios evaluates the correlation between decentralization level and ammonia production cost and distribution distance (Figure ).This analysis covers production and distribution networks between one and 6,000 global regional production locations. As the decentralization level increases, the ammonia production cost increases, and the average distribution distance decreases (Figure ).

For the complexes, that still exhibited larger singlet population, the simulation time was extended to 100 ps. All dynamics were initiated from a Wigner distribution around the triplet minimum geometry by excitation into the first absorption band The resulting time evolution of the diabatic electronic state populations that describe the excited-state dynamics of all complexes is shown by the thin lines in Figure . The diabatic states are states characterized by fixed electronic configurations, for which, in the present analysis, we use the electronic states at the triplet minimum geometry of each complex. In order to propose a kinetic model to explain the time evolution of the diabatic electronic state populations, we analyzed the individual pathways of a set of 100 trajectories through the different electronic states for each complex, see Section S5.

In this figure, states which are populated at the start of the dynamics simulations are shown at the top with labels above them denoting the initial population in percentage, e.g., 54% for the  Hypothesis I was based on the assumption that increasing the ligand-field splitting could destabilize the 3 A 2 states belonging to the e 2 g configuration. This could quench the internal conversion from the 3 T 1 ′ states to the 3 A 2 states, which is the main com-peting pathway to the intersystem crossing populating the singlet states in VCl 3 (ddpd). As can be seen, this assumption is realized in the dynamics of [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -, [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, and VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), where T 1 ′ --→ 3 A 2 internal conversion is either completely quenched ([VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -) or its importance reduced to a few percentage. In contrast, for VCl 3 (im-im-im), internal conversion to the 3 A 2 states becomes the almost sole deactivation pathway from the 3 T 1 ′ states. Nevertheless, however, more population reaches the singlet states for VCl 3 (im-im-im) (48%) compared to VCl 3 (ddpd) (43%), as the singlet states now receive population from the 3 T 2 states. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the pathway populating the singlet states in each of the four designed complexes is different from that of VCl 3 (ddpd), where all population entering the singlets is received from the 3 T 1 ′ states. For [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and for [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, the singlet states are populated from the 3 DL states that possess ligandcentered excitation character, while for VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), the singlet states are', 'Among the 18 candidates complexes, we identified four complexes with ligandfield splitting larger than VCl 3 (ddpd). In the second step, we then performed long-time nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. For the four complexes, we could observe similar or larger transfer of electronic population via intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet states when compared to VCl 3 (ddpd). For two of the complexes, [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and VCl 3 (im-im-im), reverse intersystem crossing subsequently depopulated the singlet states on a 20 ps time scale making them non-promising candidates for near-infra emission despite their large ligand-field splitting. For the other two complexes, however, we found long-lived singlet population that remains constant even after 100 ps simulation time. For VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), this population of ca. 7% is of the same size as that for the reference VCl 3 (ddpd) complex (9%). For [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, in turn, the long-lived singlet population is almost doubled to 16%, i.e., making it a promising candidate for efficient 3d-metal based near-infrared emitters.While following our hypothesis resulted in a success in the screening, the detailed analysis of the relaxation mechanisms of VCl 3 (ddpd) and the four designed complexes revealed a complex picture. Despite nominally featuring electronic states of similar character, each complex displayed a unique reaction network in its photodynamics. This suggested that the success in the screening did not originate by following the assumption of our hypothesis, but rather resulted from some other, more individual electronic-structure features. In conclusion, the excited-state decay pathways of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes are complicated due to the large number of participating electronic states. Consequently, the effect of changing the ligand on their mechanisms are both difficult to predict and not obvious just from static electronic calculations. Instead, insights from more vanadium(III)', 'ConclusionThe combination of trajectory surface hopping on potentials parametrized in the linear vibronic coupling model is an efficient approach to perform photodynamics simulations. For transition metal complexes, despite their typically large number of vibrational degrees of freedom and many close-lying electronic states, it becomes affordable to screen the nonadiabatic dynamics of many individual ones in order to test and establish design principles to improve their photophysical and photochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate this by screening the photophysics of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes derived from VCl 3 (ddpd). This complex, after excitation from the triplet ground state and following intersystem crossing to the singlet manifold, shows singlet-to-triplet phosphorescence in the nearinfrared region. Based on an analysis of the relaxation mechanism of VCl 3 (ddpd), we developed the hypothesis that by increasing the ligand-field strength in the complex could shift the electronic states to modify the mechanism in such a way as to lead to a higher phosphorescence yield. This was to be achieved by channeling more population from the triplet to the singlet states as well as reducing the amount of singlet-to-triplet reverse intersystem crossing that reduces the population available for phosphorescence.We then tested our hypothesis in two steps. First, we designed 18 complexes based on design principles established for other 3dmetal complexes with large ligand-field splitting. Thereby we found that strategies of including ligands that are strong σ -donors or both σ and π donors are particularly successful. Among the 18 candidates complexes, we identified four complexes with ligandfield splitting', 'Fig. 1 (1Fig. 1 (a) Photodynamics of VCl 3 (ddpd).

An examination of representative line plots of fluorescent profiles from each image showed clear peaks separated by ~100 nm in the post-LExM image, in contrast to peaks ~300 nm width in the pre-LExM image. Similar increases in resolution were seen in post-LExM images of labeled PC with markers of the Golgi complex and mitochondria (Figures ), with the latter enabling specific visualization of the outer mitochondrial membrane compared to other associated membranes containing tagged PC. Together, these colocalization experiments demonstrate the ability of LExM to generate super-resolution images that can precisely identify the locations of PC-containing membranes. Whereas metabolic labeling of phospholipids with ProCho enables measurement of bulk membrane lipids, many important signaling phospholipids, such as phosphatidic acid (PA), are generated at much lower levels. We have developed a method termed IMPACT to visualize the activity of phospholipase Ds (PLDs), which generate PA, by leveraging the ability of these enzymes to attach bioorthogonally labeled primary alcohols onto phospholipids in a transphosphatidylation, or head group exchange, reaction (Figure ).

We observed a strong fluorescent signal from many intracellular membranes, consistent with the broad distribution of PC in mammalian cells (Figure ). Importantly, the signal was ProCho-dependent, indicating that 1 is specific for alkyne-labeled phospholipids (Figure ).A key feature of ExM is isotropic sample expansion, which is achieved by disrupting membranes with permeabilization to enable uniform diffusion of polymerization reagents throughout the sample. This step is critical for incorporation of ionic monomers needed for the final osmotic expansion step, and for streptavidin-based anchoring strategies where such macromolecular fluorescent labeling reagents are membrane-impermeable. To ensure that monomers are evenly distributed in LExM, we used uncharged, membrane-permeable monomers that are hydrolyzed, post-polymerization, to yield ionic residues necessary for expansion.

Inspection of post-ExM images revealed channels that were surrounded by lamina, confirming their identity as nuclear invaginations (Figure ). Analysis of fluorescent profiles across individual channels revealed fluorescence signal from metabolically labeled lipids in the center of the channel, suggesting that LExM can identify intact cytoplasmic organelles contained within these nuclear invaginations (Figure ). Indeed, cells labeled by LExM exhibited strong colocalization of an ER marker and ProCho within the channel (Figure ). Further, we detected similar large nuclear invaginations in IMPACT-labeled samples co-labeled with a mitochondrial marker, in which the outer mitochondrial membrane could be distinguished from other associated membranes within the channel (Figure ). Collectively, these experiments indicate that LExM, with multiple types of metabolic and organelle labels, can detect organelles associated with nuclear invaginations, demonstrating LExM as a powerful method for detailed analysis of intracellular structures. In summary, LExM is a general method for super-resolution imaging of lipid species within cellular membranes. It exploits cell-permeable reagents that enable direct anchoring of metabolically labeled lipids to a hydrogel network, permitting tunable and isotropic expansion without detergent-based permeabilization, to preserve and illuminate molecular and structural details. LExM is compatible with metabolic labels both for bulk phospholipids and low-abundant signaling lipids, enabling high-resolution visualization of organelle membranes and subcellular structures with dimensions smaller than the diffraction limit of light. With accessible reagents and requiring only a standard confocal microscope, we', 'more general strategy for ExM-based imaging of alkyne-labeled lipids, we subjected cells to IMPACT labeling with the PLD substrate hexynol, CuAAC tagging with 1, and the LExM protocol. Consistent with the ProCho-based LExM studies, IMPACT labeling generated samples with a 5.6x expansion factor (at the 4 h hydrolysis timepoint) and fluorescence signal that correlated well with the pre-LExM image (Figure ). The enhanced resolution of the post-LExM image also enabled identification of distinct membranes in crowded areas, e.g., the nuclear envelope (Figure ). Samples generated with IMPACT were similarly obtained in a tunable manner with isotropic expansion and were amenable to colocalization studies with organelle markers (Figures ). Importantly, treatment with a pan-PLD inhibitor prevented fluorescent labeling in pre-LExM images (Figure ). Finally, we applied LExM to study specific sub-diffraction scale cellular structures.Metabolic labeling of phospholipids revealed channels that traverse nuclei, which we hypothesized were a unique class of structures known as nuclear invaginations (Video S1). These channels, comprised of nuclear membrane surrounded by lamina that envelop cytoplasmic contents, can travel through nuclei. Because of their narrow dimensions, their detailed analysis has been limited to electron microscopy and traditional super-resolution microscopy (e.g., STED/SMLM). To visualize these membrane-bound structures with ExM, we labeled cells expressing a nuclear lamina marker with ProCho and performed the LExM protocol. Inspection of post-ExM', ' Alternatively, metabolic labeling of native phospholipids has also been leveraged for expansion of membranes using click-ExM, which anchors lipids to the hydrogel network through a biotin-streptavidin conjugation. Notably, these methods require at least mild permeabilization of the membrane, which can compromise its integrity and potentially alter its structure, to ensure a uniform distribution of ExM reagents and isotropic expansion of samples.We were motivated by a desire to visualize lipids using ExM with molecular detail while preserving the structural integrity of the membranes. Here, we present an approach involving metabolic labeling of natural phospholipids, a trifunctional fluorophore for the tagging and tethering of lipids to the hydrogel, and membrane-permeable expansion reagents (Figure ). This method, termed Lipid Expansion Microscopy (LExM), allows for the tunable and isotropic expansion of membranes through direct anchoring of phospholipids into the polymer network without permeabilization. We demonstrate that LExM is a general method for the expansion of metabolically labeled lipids to enable super-resolution imaging of organelle membranes, and we apply LExM to visualize sub-diffraction scale invaginations of the nuclear membrane and their membrane-bound cytoplasmic contents. To incorporate phospholipids directly into the hydrogel network, we designed and prepared trifunctional LExM reagent 1 (Figure ), which is equipped with (i) an azido group for tagging alkyne-labeled biomolecules via Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), (ii) a BODIPY fluorophore for imaging pre-and post-LExM, and (iii) a methacrylamide polymerizable unit for direct', 'limit of light.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSIn this contribution, we presented the implementation of the Davidson algorithm and its variational variant within the quantum version of EOM-CC for computing electronically excited states. We tested the method, named qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson and qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson/Variational, on four systems: H 2 /6-31G, H 4 /STO-3G, LiH/STO-3G, and H 2 O/STO-3G(FC) showing good agreements with the energies obtained from EOM-VQE .The Davidson implementation of the qEOM-UCCSD algorithm provides the advantage over the qEOM and EOM-VQE by reducing the working Hilbert space significantly. The classic Davidson method iteratively interacts with the outcome from the quantum devices and provides feedback to grow the ansatz (vector space) to prepare desired quantum states.The implementation provides several advantages compared to the currently available excitedstate methods in quantum computing. First, qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson significantly reduces the computational demand for classical diagonalization step, because the dimension of the resulting subspace Hamiltonian only spanned by a few guess vectors. In the case of its variational variant, the Davidson algorithm provides the certain electronic configurations that are expected to contribute to the target excited states. Therefore, it introduces a significantly smaller number of variational parameters resulting in a significantly reduced searching space.In addition, similarly to the classical variant, the presented Davidson algorithm produces the excited state of the desired spatial or spin symmetry (in the case of the closed-shell references). The qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson can target the specific group of transitions by defining suitable subspace vectors and can be extended to target higher-energy states or specific transitions . Apart from the advantages of using', 'V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe consider excited states of four small molecules: H 2 /6-31G, H energies for all systems. The excitation energies for H 2 /6-31G system are identical to the FCI results showing absolute errors less than 10 -5 mE h since SD level of theory recovers FCI regime for the two-particle systems. The suggested algorithms also produce nearly exact excitation energies for LiH/STO-3G system showing all errors are within the shaded region (M AX(error) ∼ 0.17 mE h and M AX(error) ∼ 0.30 mE h for the non-variational and variational, respectively). From Fig. ) and (d), one can clearly see that the errors in excitation energies exceed the target accuracy, 1.6 mE h , for the H 4 /STO-3G and the H 2 O/STO-3G at certain inter-nuclear distances due to the strong electron correlation. In the case of water molecule, it is known from standard EOM-CCSD that triple excitations are significant in the bond-breaking regime . In the case of the H 4 /STO-3G system, one needs to take into account triple excitations for T 1 , T 2 , S 2 , and S 3 states. In addition, even quadruple level of excitations (FCI level) need to be considered to achieve the target accuracy for S 1 with a much smaller subspace resulting in the electronic configurations, which are expected to recover the electronic correlations of the current excited state. That is, the dimension of the working space remains within a practical regime for classical computers. The numerical example of H 4 /STO-3G with SDTQ level of excitations is shown in Fig. .Note that the dimension of the working space does not grow significantly with the Davidson method. However, the increase in the level of excitations leads to the increase in the number of projections to be measured in the residual vector calculations of Eq.

The relative phase between two configurations is appropriately adjusted depending on the spin symmetry.

133,"IntroductionPerfluoroalkyls (PFAS, also known as forever or bio-cumulative compounds) have recently emerged as a class of chemicals that urgently requires effective detection and removal. These compounds, mainly perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanoic sulfonic acid (PFOS), are common in industry as synthetic surfactants for the synthesis of polymer materials used in carpeting, upholstery, apparel, floor wax, textiles, firefighting foams, and sealants. Despite their ubiquity, PFAS have shown to be extremely persistent in the environment. Their slow degradability has led to an overwhelming abundance in the soil, dust, air, and groundwater.Unfortunately, these compounds have also been identified as carcinogens, among many other health effects, making them a global health threat. The detection and efficient removal of PFAS has thus become an important topic in recent years as these ""forever chemicals"" continue to be found in daily-use products and drinking water sources. These environmental factors coupled with the unique physical and chemical properties of PFAS require novel materials and sensing platforms for rapid and sensitive detection of these pernicious compounds.The typical strategy for sensitively detecting chemicals is to use high surface-area materials. In this context, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive materials family as they provide a rich library of systems with high surface area, intrinsic porosity, and high molecular adsorptivity. They have been extensively studied for a variety of applications ranging from catalysis, energy storage, chemical capture, as well as sensing. <ref",Causal,Why are PFAS considered a global health threat?,"PFAS are considered a global health threat because they have been identified as carcinogens and have many other health effects.

We further show ultrasensitive detection using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Here, common pollutants (e.g. salts) have been well studied and can be filtered out using ubiquitous methods, but PFAS, in addition to requiring more sophisticated and costly treatment techniques (e.g. powdered activated carbon and nanofiltration), remain difficult to remove owing to their physicochemical properties, thus posing a major threat when undetected. We chose to sense the two most common PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its sulfonic acid analogue (PFOS) and tested their adsorption onto Cu-HHTP in water samples.The oxidation of Cu-HHTP was indeed observed when the MOF thin film on ITO electrodes was dipped into a sample of water contaminated by different amounts of PFOA. The current-voltage (I-V) curves in Figure b show an increase in film conductivity with increasing amount of PFOA added into the water. This increase in the current response from a two-terminal device was a first, simple, and yet clear indicator that Cu-HHTP becomes oxidized in the presence of aqueous PFAS. Cyclic voltammograms obtained with Cu-HHTP films as a working electrode (versus an Ag/AgCl reference and a Pt mesh as the counter electrode) in PBS also showed an obvious increase in the MOF's oxidation and reduction activity when pristine PBS was compared to a 10 nM PFOA solution in PBS (Fig. ). A strong and reversible oxidation peak around 0.312 V (with a reduction peak detected at -0.315 V) emerged when PFOA was added into the electrolyte. A control experiment in which the same potential was applied to the electrochemical cell, but in the absence of Cu-HHTP onto the ITO-working electrode, i.e. a bare ITO working as the working electrode, showed no redox activity from PFOA alone (Fig. ). This electrochemical behavior suggests that the observed redox activity within the scanned"", 'change even after 10 cycles, likely due to abundant binding sites at the film interface. This excellent sensitivity towards PFAS in MOF-based devices contrasted with a control device where a bare channel used and immersed in contaminated water similarly to the MOF-based sensor. The bare channel shows an increase in resistance when PFOA was introduced in PBS (Fig. ) as expected after introducing non-conductive analytes. Given the sensitivity of impedance spectroscopy towards electrolyte compositional changes, the observed decrease in our MOF film resistance while the electrolyte resistance increases proves that the material is indeed sensing the analyte. Such working mechanism using Cu-HHTP allows us to efficiently detect oxidative agents (in this case PFAS) especially in water using a robust and affordable setup.The MOF-based sensors we demonstrate are easy to fabricate, scalable, and offer readouts in minutes as opposed to other techniques such as mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, time-of-flight mass spectrometry) which involve long sample preparation and data acquisition times. In fact, our sensors show to be extremely sensitive (with a detection limit as low as 0.002 ng/L) towards the two most common PFAS (PFOA and PFOS) proving to detect these compounds well below their health advisory levels (HALs) recommended by the US environmental protection agency (EPA) and the food and drug administration (FDA). In drinking water, the HALs for these two acids have been set to as low as 10 ng/L.

1099,"IntroductionPhotoredox catalysis has emerged in the last decade as an important approach to perform new organic transformations. These reactions include cyclizations, cross couplings, amine and olefin functionalizations and are routinely used in the synthesis of pharmacophores and drug-like molecules. Typically, photoredox catalysis is driven by either energy transfer (EnT) or photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the photocatalyst and a quencher which forms a reactive radical or ionic species that initiates the desired reactivity. The mechanism for PET occurs in one of two ways: (i) Reductive quenching, whereby the photocatalyst is quenched through acceptance of an electron from a reductant, or (ii) oxidative quenching, whereby the photocatalyst donates an electron to an oxidant (Figure ). The quenching agent may be an integrated component of the transformation, such as one of the organic substrates or a co-catalyst, or a sacrificial quencher that serves to convert the photocatalyst to a species that can oxidize or reduce the organic substrate, such as O2 or alkyl amines.

We automated the plate preparation by writing a protocol to direct a liquid handling robot (Tecan Freedom EVO 100) to dispense the solutions of photocatalyst and quencher into 96-well plates. First, one photocatalyst was dispensed across the entire plate. We maintained the quencher concentration as the variable across rows and selected 12 widely used quenchers for the columns. With this design, one photocatalyst could be analyzed on a plate in less than one minute. The automated liquid dispensing allowed us to prepare plates for each of 20 common photocatalysts in <2 h entirely under inert atmosphere (Figure ) for a total of 1920 samples to generate 220 quenching constants.The 12 quenchers were N,N-Diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, 4-methoxystyrene, Hantzsch ester, quinuclidine, bis(pinacolato)diboron, phenylacetic acid, tris(trimethylsylil)silanol, and potassium cyclohexyltrifluoroborate as reductive quenchers and di-tert-butyl peroxide and diethylbromomalonate as oxidative quenchers (sodium persulfate was included as well but exhibited low solubility in MeCN such that no quenching was measured and reported). These quenchers were selected for their wide use in many different photoredox reactions. Trialkylamines are typically used as a sacrificial reductant to enable access to a highly reducing photocatalyst and, as such, are used in a wide range of reactions. The other reagents contain functional groups that will typically generate reactive radicals upon photocatalyst quenching, and that will undergo the desired reactivity. The photocatalysts were selected to contain diverse chemical structures such as cyanoarene-based photocatalysts, acridinium salts, ruthenium (II) complexes, iridium (III) complexes and', '1: (A) General scheme for oxidative and reductive photocatalyst quenching. (B) Spectral changes from emission quenching (C) Stern Volmer analysis', 'photocatalysts, acridinium salts, ruthenium (II) complexes, iridium (III) complexes and other miscellaneous organophotocatalysts. This selection varies not only in structures and photophysical properties, but also in redox potentials, while encompassing the most commonly used catalysts for photoredox reactions (Figure ). The Ksv for the different photocatalyst are reported in Table . For low Ksv values, the entry is shown as <5. In such cases, higher concentrations of quenchers will be needed to determine Ksv.  Interestingly, we observed entries exhibiting negative deviations from linearity in their quenching profiles, mostly with Hantzsch ester (Figure ) and diethylbromomalonate. This type of behavior has been attributed to the presence of different conformers for the photocatalyst, which give rise to a fractional accessibility of the fluorophore. Some cases cases can be treated using a modified Stern-Volmer equation, namely the Lehrer equation. It should be noted that the Hantzsch ester, unlike the other quenchers, also has a non-negligeable absorbance up to 400 nm and emits at 450 nm, which overlaps with the absorbance and emission of a few of the selected photocatalysts, thereby creating an inner filter effect which interferes with the Stern Volmer measurement. Therefore, data for this particular quencher might not reflect the true photocatalyst quenching rate. Overall, we observed strong quenching from trialkyl amines with typically oxidative excited photocatalysts (Figure ), which is unsurprising considering their wide use as quenchers in many photoredox reactions. DIPEA is the substrate that exhibits quenching with most photocatalysts in the collection. Conversely,', 'Results and DiscussionIn photoredox reactions, the first step in the photochemical cycle is excitation of the photocatalyst by a photon of the appropriate wavelength. Upon excitation, the photocatalyst can decay back to the ground state in a radiative (via photon emission, i.e. fluorescence or phosphorescence) or non-radiative way (heat) (Figure ). In the presence of increased concentration of a quencher, the photocatalyst excited state can also react via EnT or PET, which will compete with radiative decays and ultimately decrease photon emission (Figure ). The decrease in emission intensity is linked to the concentration of quencher as described by the Stern-Volmer equation (equation 1):𝐼 0 𝐼 = 1 + 𝑘 𝑞 𝜏 0 [𝑄] (1)where I0 is the emission intensity in the absence of quencher, I is the intensity in the presence of quencher, kq is the quenching constant, \uf0740 is the excited state lifetime and [Q] is the quencher concentration. The product of kq and \uf0740 is often described as Ksv, the Stern-Volmer constant. KSV can be used to compare quenching rates between different quenchers (Figure ). The knowledge of Ksv and [Q] for all the components of a reaction enables the ranking of quenching power and ultimately identification of the main quencher for the photocatalyst.In a typical Stern Volmer experiment, independent solutions of different concentrations of quenchers and a constant concentration of photocatalyst need to be prepared under a rigorously inert atmosphere, and the excitation intensity of each one must be measured separately to extract I and build the Stern Volmer plot. We decided to take advantage of', 'rapid discovery of new photoredox reactions. To keep up with the exponentially increasing chemical space for photoredox transformations, new workflows that enable Stern-Volmer data collection at a higher throughput need to be developed.To that end, we have devised a protocol for the collection of Stern-Volmer quenching data using commercially available fluorescence plate readers and consumable 96-well plates. Plate readers are ubiquitous in biological studies and have been used in a variety of colorimetric and fluorometric assays, as they allow for rapid (<1 min) reading of an entire 96-well plate. In our quenching studies, the use of well-plates enables the collection of Stern-Volmer constants for one photocatalyst and up to 12 quenchers in less than a minute. We further expanded the throughput of this workflow by devising a protocol for a liquid handling robot to enable the automated dispensing of quenchers at increasing concentrations in a 96-well plate format. This allowed us to rapidly prepare multiple plates of 20 commonly used photocatalysts, and for each, measure the Stern-Volmer constants of 11 common quenchers. The 220 quenching rates table generated opens the door for deeper data analysis of quenching trends and mechanisms, and we believe will be useful to the community interested in mechanistic understanding of photoredox catalysis.']","['Spectroscopy', 'Optical spectroscopy']",237,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9541137203857633,0.502815099125435,['why']
66,"Hydrogen storageAn important component of the supply chains of fossil fuels is the storage facilities. This is particularly relevant for gaseous fuels such as natural gas, where large-scale storage requires large volumes that can only be found underground. Storage of energy carriers is vital to the social acceptance, immediate implementation, and economy inclusion. It is also the primary method of coping with the fluctuations in supply and demand. One of the causes of the spike in the natural gas price at the end of 2021 was indeed the depletion of the European gas reservoirs that were put under stress by the decreased natural gas supply from abroad, namely Russia.Underground storage of hydrogen can be done in a similar fashion as the underground storage of natural gas i.e., in salt caverns. Salt caverns are synthetic subsurface structures that are developed by 'washing' away salt from an underground salt deposit until a hollow structure is formed. Salt caverns offer the most promising underground storage option due to the large sealing capacity of rock salt, its inert nature, as well as their flexibility toward injection/withdrawal cycles. Although salt deposits are not commonplaces in the world, they are not particularly rare, either: there is a significant amount of salt deposits spread throughout Europe (Figure ). It is estimated that the total on-and off-shore European hydrogen storage potential is 84.8 PWhH2, which represents more than 8 times of the total final energy consumption in Europe in 2020.

In this context, the development of the (trans)national hydrogen transport networks anywhere has not been felt by stakeholders in the hydrogen sector.', 'Hydrogen shipping and hydrogen carriersHydrogen transportation is a crucial component in establishing a global hydrogen economy. While pipeline transport is practical for short distances, the transportation of hydrogen across oceans is necessary for long distances. The development of hydrogen shipping using various carriers, including compressed gas, liquefied hydrogen, and ammonia, presents an opportunity for countries to access clean energy sources that may not be available locally. However, several challenges need to be addressed, such as safety, cost-effectiveness, and competition with existing supply chains.This type of transportation is known as hydrogen shipping and can be accomplished using various hydrogen carriers (Table ).

The main disadvantage of transporting hydrogen via tube trailers is the high cost of transported hydrogen: a single tube trailer can only carry approximately 400 kg of hydrogen, and the limitation lies in the weight of the steel tubes used as well as in the maximum allowable storage pressure in tube trailers (250 bar in the U.S.). One of the proposals that has recently gained significant attention in the hydrogen world is to repurpose the existing natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure. Transporting hydrogen in a network that has already been commissioned would bring significant advantages including 1) a short(er) time horizon for the development of a large-scale hydrogen transport infrastructure, 2) significantly lower capital expenditures (CAPEX) of the transport system for hydrogen, and 3) to bring freedom and certainty to stakeholders on both the consumption and production sides of hydrogen, so that they can develop projects where they deem it best suited to their interests.The retrofitting of the existing natural gas infrastructure to accommodate hydrogen comes with challenges of its own. As a first example, there could be competition with natural gas. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that natural gas will continue to play a role in the global energy mix, both in the lead up to 2050 and potentially beyond. This implies that hydrogen and natural gas could compete with one another for access to the transport infrastructure; in principle, this could be solved by physically blending hydrogen in the natural gas, albeit blending', ""to cover a potential surge in demand in the coming decades.The investigation of underground hydrogen storage is currently underway in various regions of the world. However, this research is at an earlier stage compared to other aspects of the hydrogen value chain. Consequently, the deployment of large-scale hydrogen storage may take more time. Nevertheless, an appealing underground hydrogen storage is the H2 project at Teesside, UK. British Petroleum and stakeholders aimed at creating the United Kingdom's first fully integrated hydrogen production and CCUS hub. The Teesside project aims to lower the industrial cluster's carbon footprint by generating blue hydrogen from natural gas, capturing the CO2, and storing it offshore. The initiative also has economic benefits and supports the UK's net-zero emissions target.Another clear example for the same effort is the HyStock project at Zuidwending, the Netherlands.

The development of gas transport infrastructure was historically done in view of two types of gas to deliver: 1) the transport of 'town gas' i.e., gasified coal that consists of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in urban settlements, and 2) the natural gas (either low caloric or high caloric) that holds little to no hydrogen. As such, it is not expected that hydrogen would be compatible with the existing assets in the natural gas transport infrastructure, in particular looking at the transmission grid (in many countries it consists of large-diameter pipelines with a nominal operating pressure upwards of 50 bar) and being mindful of pressure-induced phenomena such as permeation, leaks, or hydrogeninduced embrittlement.There are several past and ongoing projects to prove the extent to which the assets of the natural gas infrastructure can be reused for hydrogen or hydrogen blends and to which extent they would need to be replaced or maintained more often (both of which would result in increased hydrogen transport costs).

In one of the models the Al cation compensates the charges around three Al centers (Al triplets) in one six-membered ring. In the other two models the Al ion is located within sixmembered ring containing two framework Al centers, while the third compensated Al is next to that ring (Al triplet -3 framework Al sites adjacent to each other).

We recently demonstrated that the extra-framework aluminum (EFAL) species that form in zeolite after thermal/steaming treatment are alumina clusters formed during steaming with a high proportion of coordinatively unsaturated penta Al sites (due to their small size) : CO adsorption on these sites produces the presently observed band with a maximum at 2240-2232 cm - 1 .

Such a Lewis acid site has not been reported for any zeolite; this C-O stretching frequency of 2252 cm -1 is the highest known for any supported material. The high C-O stretching frequency suggests that this Lewis site is super-electrophilic and its ability to coordinate CO suggests that it is coordinatively unsaturated. We explored the properties of this site by pulling high vacuum (~10 -8 Torr) at room temperature, which leads to the disappearance of the CO band on alumina clusters but the 2252 cm -1 band is retained, signifying its stability (Fig. ).

The energy released by the impingement is dissipated within approximately one turnover time of the largest eddies. As a result, micromixing was studied using a simple model that assumes diffusion of species in slabs of fixed thickness (2𝐿), which are generated within the impingement zone. The experimental study followed the progress of an acid-base neutralization containing a fluorophore. A simulation, which included a module for calculating the fluorescence, determined 2𝐿 for experimental energy dissipation rates (𝜖) ranging from 5x10 3 to 7.7x10 6 W/kg. 2𝐿 was found to lie in the range of turbulence dissipative scales less than the Taylor microscale but greater than the Kolmogorov microscale (𝜂).

A simple micromixing model was employed to determine the fixed slab thickness for diffusion of acid and base within the mixed sheet. The diffusion slab thickness, 2𝐿, was found to lie between the Taylor microscale, 𝜆 𝑔 , and an order of magnitude dissipative microscale, [𝜆 = 𝜆 𝑔 /(15) 0.5 ], but well above the Kolmogorov microscale, 𝜂.

Similar to 𝜆 𝑔 and 𝜆, the ratio of the slab thickness to the velocity of the turbulent kinetic energy (𝑣\') is a function of (𝜈 𝜖 ⁄ ) 1/2 , where 𝜈 is the kinematic viscosity and 𝜖 is the energy dissipation rate. However, 2𝐿 𝑣′ ⁄ is also a function of the Reynolds number of the large energy-containing eddies to the -1/4 power. If these results are used for other systems, it is recommended that 𝐶 𝜖 in Eq. 50 be set equal to 𝐶 𝜖𝐴 (= 0.5).The results also verified the relationship of the dimensionless dissipation rate coefficient, 𝐶 𝜖 , with the energy dissipation rate that was found in the study on the volume of the energy dissipation zone .

It is formed after hydrolysis of Si-O bonds around a silicon center next to the Al (but not the Si bound to the bridging hydroxyl). In such situation the acidic proton from bridging hydroxyl is close to aluminol AlOH group and may protonate the O center from it.

While hybrid functionals such as B3LYP have long-range (nonlocal) effects through Hartree-Fock exchange, they remain local in correlation and, therefore, are unable to describe the R -6 asymptotic distancedependence of dispersion forces correctly.Interaction Energy (kcal/mol)LDABLYPB3LYPB3LYP-DCCSD(T)AT Stack-6.425.393.53-7.71-8.10AT Pair-22.90-11.61-13.09-17.77-16.40GC Stack-4.65-0.23-1.20-6.24-7.90GC Pair-44.00-27.77-30.60-36.41-35.80RMSE5.549.067.381.14of interaction energies predicted by LDA, BLYP, B3LYP, and B3LYP-D against CCSD(T) reference values from the S22 dataset.As can be seen in Figure2and Table1, the B3LYP-D and LDA functionals are in good and reasonable agreement, respectively, with the benchmark values; however, the', 'Figure 2 .2Figure 2.

The B3LYP functional gives weaker binding energies than the CCSD(T) benchmarks, and prior work by Zhang et al. suggested that this under-binding becomes more pronounced with increasing molecular size. As such, B3LYP will incur significant errors for the large periodic strands, as we demonstrate in the next section. Based on these benchmark calculations, the B3LYP-D functional most closely matches the CCSD(T) results, particularly for the van-der-Waalsstacked monomers. In contrast, both the BLYP and B3LYP functionals produce geometries that are highly distorted in which the individual Watson-Crick base pairs are not even aligned in the same plane. A frequency analysis can give further information on structural stability; however, geometry optimizations of these large, periodic systems were already computationally expensive (requiring hundreds of thousands of CPU hours), and frequency calculations were out of reach for these structures. For this reason, we only present the structures in Figure , which clearly depict the base pairs to be misaligned with each other to depict the distortions/instabilities in these structures. The structural deformations in these periodic strands are fully consistent with the benchmark calculations described in the previous section. In particular, our benchmark calculations on individual nucleotides showed that only LDA and B3LYP-D predict stable A-T and C-G stacks/Watson-Crick pairs in comparison to the CCSD(T) benchmarks.

Afterwards, the singlet population falls again due to intersystem crossing to the 3 T 2 states (green line) from where the population relaxes to the 3 T 1 ground states (red line).

This could quench the internal conversion from the 3 T 1 ′ states to the 3 A 2 states, which is the main com-peting pathway to the intersystem crossing populating the singlet states in VCl 3 (ddpd).

In the second step, we then performed long-time nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.

For two of the complexes, [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and VCl 3 (im-im-im), reverse intersystem crossing subsequently depopulated the singlet states on a 20 ps time scale making them non-promising candidates for near-infra emission despite their large ligand-field splitting. For the other two complexes, however, we found long-lived singlet population that remains constant even after 100 ps simulation time.

Despite nominally featuring electronic states of similar character, each complex displayed a unique reaction network in its photodynamics. This suggested that the success in the screening did not originate by following the assumption of our hypothesis, but rather resulted from some other, more individual electronic-structure features.

In fact, photocatalytic water splitting is considered the ""holy grail"" reaction in physical chemistry, as it can directly generate H2 from water.

On the one hand, steps forward in each low (laboratory reactors), medium (pilot devices), and large (plants) TRLs are mandatory to foster larger H2 photoproduction plants. On the other hand, rational design of efficient and stable photoabsorber/catalyst with intriguing aforementioned properties is a high demand task. The importance of this point is to consider all the eco-friendly policies and green chemistry principles to follow decarbonization guidelines. This will not be an easy task, but efforts are being made to satisfy the technological transfer demands with low CO2 footprint materials synthesis and processes.Given the relatively low efficiency of water splitting based on PC and PEC, these approaches should be integrated and adapted to suit specific needs, for instance for the decentralized production of hydrogen. In this context, direct seawater splitting is a promising technology, owing to the abundance and availability of seawater: about 71 percent of the Earth's surface is water-covered, with saline water accounting for 96.5% of all the water available on Earth. Moreover, 77% of all countries worldwide have direct access to seawater, a renewable resource that is constantly replenished by the natural water cycle. The use of seawater for the decentralized production of hydrogen could eliminate the need to use purified water, which can be expensive and"", 'H2 requires less theoretical electricity consumption, as previously reported and as schematized in Figure . Noteworthy, the theoretical operating voltage for a device performing biomass electrolysis could be as low as 0.5 V. From a PC/PEC point of view, this voltage could be achieved with the photovoltage generated by single junction photoabsorbers, as reported in Figure . This is a net advantage over water electrolysis, since the higher operating voltages required to split water necessitates multi-absorber tandems connected in series to yield additive photovoltages. Furthermore, biomass oxidation offers the opportunity to produce value-added chemicals, representing a highly efficient power-to-X (X = fuel and chemicals) conversion. These combined aspects have the potential to produce green hydrogen at relatively low cost, adding further value by the generation of diverse chemical commodities. ', 'Green hydrogenGreen hydrogen is produced by using water and sunlight (or renewable-driven electricity). There are mainly three types of solar-driven water electrolysis processes: photocatalytic (PC) water splitting, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, and photovoltaics (PV) combined with electrolysis. Among the above three approaches, PV-driven water splitting already reaches relatively high TRLs (TRL 7), with recently demonstrated solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies up to about 20%. Higher efficiencies are foreseen in the near future using tandem solar cells based on improved hybrid organicinorganic perovskite light absorbers. Recently, the certified solar to electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) tandems of lead halide perovskite with silicon has reached 32.5 %, a value previously achieved only by expensive III/V semiconductors.

The integration of the AM1.5 spectrum up to the NIR cutoff (1107 nm) set by the Si bottom absorber returns an accessible photon flux of about 2.46 × 10 21 s -1 •m -2 . Given an PCE of 30%, the photon flux effectively converted into electricity (~7.38 × 10 20 s -1 •m -2 ) generates a current density of almost 120 A•m -2 , provided by the PV module to the electrolyzer (for this estimation, the PCE was considered equal to 30% for both absorbers in the tandem device).

Even the most efficient OER electrocatalysts to date show significant overpotentials (up to 0.4 V), which leads to a significant amount of energy being spent on producing oxygen, a product with low market value. As a result, the deployment of the green hydrogen production market is hindered: green hydrogen currently accounts for only 4% of the overall production worldwide, equivalent to 3.8 Mt in 2021. Interestingly, this is in line with the amount of electricity produced worldwide using solar PV, accounting for 3.6% (179 TWh in 2021). Therefore, boosting the largescale production of green hydrogen requires the parallel optimization and scale-up of both solar PV and electrolyzers. Value-added oxidation reactions are an attractive pathway to further reduce green hydrogen production costs by reducing energy consumption and adding market value. Biomass electrolysis offers a potential solution to replace the sluggish OER at the anodic side of (photo)electrolyzers with the more favorable organic molecule oxidation, which could lead to a more efficient production process. The hydrogen produced in this way is still considered ""green"" since biomass is recognized as a CO2-neutral, abundant, and renewable substitute for fossil fuels.

This dual role of the enzyme in facilitating rapid ligation and overcoming product inhibition suggests that prebiotic replication might have required interactions with surfaces or aqueous complexes that bound the intermediate complex more strongly than the product duplex, thereby facilitating turnover. LIDA involves two coupled cycles initiated by the introduction of a target template (DNA-I) in the presence of an excess of four fragments, two of which (Ia and IbP) constitute the target sequence after their ligation. In the first step, the DNA-I hybridizes with one of two complementary fragments; the hybridization of the 5'-phosphate abasic containing fragment IIaP to the DNA-I is shown in the scheme in Figure . Next, the other fragment IIb hybridizes forming a ternary complex. The T4 DNA ligase present in the solution can ligate the ternary complex to generate the product duplex. Upon spontaneous dissociation of this product duplex, the newly synthesized DNA-II is liberated, which can template the formation of DNA-I through similar steps (Cycle II, Figure ).

In Cycle I, the 5\' phosphate is located on the abasic-containing strand (the 10mer IIap, Figure ), while in Cycle II, the 5\' phosphate is present on the deoxyadenosine terminated strand (the 9mer Iap, Figure ). Ligation was performed at 8 °C and 12 °C, which should allow all or most of the fragment duplexes to be hybridized given their thermal denaturation temperatures (TM = 24 °C) under similar conditions. Interestingly the results of the ligation experiment at both temperatures revealed that only the formation of DNA-II in Cycle I occurred by this pseudo-blunt end process (Figure ). No ligation of the 5\'-phosphate deoxyadenosine across from the abasic site to generate DNA-I via Cycle II was observed. These results suggest the background reaction is triggered by DNA-II formation based on the ligation of the 5\'-abasic phosphate strands via this pseudo-blunt end ligation. Therefore, only the formation of DNA-II by this background process was considered in our kinetic model, as described below.', ""Results and DiscussionTo quantify the reactivity of the ligation of the 5'-phosphate abasic single overhang, an excess of the enzyme was used to catalyze the reaction ([Fluorescent labeled limiting substrate, DNA-Ia] = 1.4 µM, [Substrate] = 2.8 µM and [Enzyme] = 2.3 µM). The data was modeled with a bimolecular reaction (A + B → AB) using Kintek Explorer software as the fragments are assumed to be hybridized at this low temperature (i.e. the Ia:IIa duplex is substrate A and Ib:IIb duplex is substrate B). The rate constant for the forward reaction extracted from the fit was 27 ± 7 M -1 s -1 at 8 °C and 50 ± 20 M -1 s -1 at 12 °C. In addition to its relevance to understanding the mechanism of LIDA, these results reveal that T4 DNA ligase tolerates a single 5'-phosphate abasic overhang and readily ligates it in a non-templated blunt-end like reaction. However, this enzyme will not perform single overhang ligation directly across from an abasic group.With greater insight into the background-triggered process, we next sought to determine the stabilities of several relevant complexes present during LIDA. Abasic groups are known to cause base-flipping when positioned centrally in a duplex, consistent with the substantial depression in thermal denaturation temperature upon its introduction. However, prior to ligation of the 5'abasic phosphate, the abasic ground lies at the end of a duplex (at the nicked site of the ternary complex). In this position, its destabilizing effect should be less significant as it would not promote base flipping of neighboring nucleotides. Previously, we performed thermal denaturation experiments and found that the abasic site did appear to be more destabilizing for the product duplex compared with the impact on intermediate complexes based on the effects on the thermal dissociation (melting) temperatures"", ""ConclusionIn conclusion, it has been shown that the addition of an abasic group at the ligation site instead of thymidine decreases the product duplex affinity constants for a particular 18mer duplex from 10 12 M -1 to 10 8 M -1 and the intermediate complex from 10 4 -10 5 M -1 to 10 3 -10 4 M -1 at 30 °C, the optimal replication temperature for this sequence. However, in the presence of an enzyme, the stability gap between the abasic-containing product and intermediate complexes is reduced from 10 4 -10 5 to 10 2 . We attribute this surprising difference to the stronger affinity of the enzyme for the intermediate rather than product complexes. This finding explains how we observe very fast selfreplication with LIDA despite the expected product inhibition. Indeed, our kinetic model reveals how rapid self-replication can be achieved even when the affinity constants are higher for the product duplex and the intermediate complex; a fast enough kcat is required together with a high enough affinity constant for the intermediate complex. Altogether, both the abasic group at the ligation site (which preferentially destabilizes the product duplex) and T4 DNA ligase (which preferentially stabilizes the intermediate) play significant roles in achieving rapid isothermal DNA self-replication. Therefore, a successful oligonucleotide self-replication system should incorporate product destabilization and a catalyst that favors the intermediate complex to further overcome product inhibition. These results can guide efforts to generate autonomous self-replicating oligonucleotides that use chemical rather than enzymatic ligation.Figure 1 .1Figure 1. Self-replication of DNA-I by lesion-induced DNA amplification (LIDA) from four primers (Ia, IbP, IIaP, IIb). The IIaP strand contains the destabilizing abasic group at the 5'"", 'Self-replication of nucleic acids in the absence of enzymes such as polymerases or ligases represents an important and poorly understood step in the origin of life. In fact, the self-replication of nucleic acids remains strongly hindered by product inhibition, even when enzymes are present.Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self-replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved.Previously, our group reported lesion-induced DNA amplification (LIDA), which is an isothermal ligase chain reaction. It was proposed that the lesion, a destabilizing abasic group, played an important role in reducing product inhibition. However, using abasic groups in non-enzymatic ligation cycles did not yield appreciable amplification. In order to identify the unknown factors that overcome product inhibition in LIDA, we have performed a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the process, employing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and global fitting of PAGE fluorescence data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We found that in the absence of an enzyme, the ligated product binds four to five orders of magnitude more tightly to the template than to the shorter unligated strands of the intermediate complex. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase, this stability gap was reduced by two orders of magnitude, such that the intermediate and product complexes were roughly equal in stability. Thus, the ligase helps overcome product inhibition by reducing the affinity difference between the DNA product duplex and the intermediate complex. Furthermore, kinetic simulations showed that the stability of the intermediate complex, as well as the rate constant of ligation, significantly impacts the rate of self-replication, suggesting that catalysts that stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to']","['Catalysis', 'Enzymatic catalysis']",1106,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9979667647892316,-2.220446049250313e-16,"['at', 'what', 'temperature', 'the', 'did']"
