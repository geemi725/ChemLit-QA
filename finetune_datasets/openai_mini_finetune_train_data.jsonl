The 6-D NN PES for a model system of heterogeneous catalysis, that is CO adsorbate on Ru(0001) surface, has been constructed. Based on this, longtime MD simulations have been carried out for the temperature-dependent thermodynamics of adsorbate adsorption and movement on surface. The smooth and reliable 2-D PMF surfaces at seven different temperatures (from 300 to 900 K) have been obtained, and abundant temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties have archived. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of NN PES MD simulations on temperature-dependent thermodynamics for a chemisorbed molecule on transition metal surface.The temperature-dependent thermodynamics as well as the diffusion kinetics for adsorbate on-surface adsorption and movement have been explored by this dynamic computational strategy. We are unexpected to find that the calculated free energy difference and diffusion barrier between the two stable binding sites (top and hcp) increase other than reduce along with the temperature raising, contrary to the common intuition. In addition, our dynamic computational strategy provides an efficient approach to evaluate the reaction kinetics directly, and also provides a benchmark to evaluate the applicable of TST that is the most common computational tool for obtaining reaction kinetics in theoretical catalysis. Our results also showed that there is significant deviation for TST in on-surface diffusion kinetics.Our dynamic computational strategy also provides a chance to evaluate the reliability of common static computational strategy. Our results indicated there is significant deviation of static computational strategy, although the static computational strategy performs a right variation tendency with temperature change in qualitative for \nQuestion:\n For what model system has the 6-D NN PES been constructed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: CO adsorbate on Ru(0001) surface", "weight": 1}]}

Different concentrations of PFAS were obtained by diluting dissolved PFOA and stock PFOS in PBS.Substrate treatment: Glass substrates with ITO-stripes were first sonicated in water, acetone, and isopropanol successively for 5 mins then dried with pure N2. The cleaned substrates were then treated under UV-ozone lamp for 30 mins. This contrasted with harsher (piranha treatment) alternative which tends to etch away the ITO. Using the more benign surface treatment allowed to pre-determine the film growth area by covering the undesired areas with acrylic tape. The ozone treated substrates were then immediately immersed into the salt solution for film growth.MOF film growth: A 1 mM solution of copper acetate was first pulled over treated substrates and allowed adhere onto the surface for 10 mins. The substrates were then carefully rinsed by dipping in fresh ethanol before being transferred into another container with a 0.1 mM solution of HHTP ligand in ethanol. The ligand exchange on the substrate surface was then allowed to proceed for 20 minutes without disturbance at ambient. After rinsing off unreacted ligands with fresh ethanol, the dipping steps were repeated to desired film thickness.

Photocatalysis is characterized by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that initiate oxidation reactions leading to the degradation of dye molecules. Several factors, including the molecular weight, dye structure, and unique characteristics of UiO-66-NDC, can impact the efficacy of dye removal. Optimal results were achieved with a catalyst concentration of 300 mg/L, as higher dosages led to reduced efficiency due to particle agglomeration and decreased light access to active sites.Higher initial dye concentrations also resulted in reduced removal rates due to increased competition for reactive radicals. The study highlighted the importance of understanding initial dye concentration for wastewater treatment. The study assessed UiO-66-NDC's reusability, showing a gradual decline in catalytic efficiency with each cycle due to active site depletion.Despite this, it demonstrated environmental sustainability and economic feasibility for water remediation, with some limitations in long-term reuse.

Their layered and porous nature makes them attractive candidates for electronics, optoelectronics, and catalysis.

We study the intercalation of first-row transition metals in the bilayer to enhance and fine-tune their electronic behavior. Furthermore, we perform a systematic study to understand the magnetic behavior of the intercalated transition metals. We found that the concentration and position of transition metals in the structure can drastically change the 2D COFs' electronic and magnetic features.

For example, Antonschmidt et al. used solid-state NMR (ssNMR) to discover atomic resolution data on aggregation intermediates in the presence of phospholipid membranes . This revealed that the formation of two loop regions (residues 58 to 61 and 71 to 80) initiates \u03b1-synuclein fibril formation.

It was discovered that a specific domain was forming an amyloid core, like one would expect to find in the brain of a patient with Alzheimers.

Therefore, the reliability of static computational strategy depends on whether the ideal models are deviated from the realistic conditions. In comparison, MD simulations is a well-tested approach to obtain the thermodynamics as well as the kinetics of the target system by going beyond ideal models. The reliability of the dynamic computational strategy in statistical thermodynamics depends on whether the converged sampling can be achieved.The dynamic computational strategy based on AIMD simulations has been used to face some issues in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the expensive computational cost in AIMD simulations greatly limited its wide applications. The NN PES provides an accurate and efficient computational approach by avoiding most expensive ab initio calculations. Therefore, a dynamic computational strategy by combination of NN PES and MD simulations has been proposed here for efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent thermodynamics for heterogeneous catalysis. We have constructed a 6-D NN PES for CO adsorbate on Ru(0001) surface, which can fully reproduce the potential energy and gradients at ab initio level.Base on it, converged sampling by MD simulation has been carried out for the temperaturedependent thermodynamics of CO adsorption and diffusion on the surface.

This motivated us to employ single-cell Raman spectroscopy for the location-specific identification of HSC fate decisions in microarrays. However, because immature populations of hematopoietic cells do not produce biomolecules that create new Raman peaks as they differentiate , we use partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to identify the between-population spectral variability that is most useful for identification of cell differentiation stage.

The C1s signals are centered at 284.66 eV for azupyrene and 284.81 eV for pyrene with respect to the Fermi energy EF. The azupyrene peak shows a larger width (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 1.16 eV) and is slightly asymmetric with a shoulder at the high binding energy side. The pyrene peak is symmetric and has a smaller width (FWHM = 0.94 eV). The differences in peak shape and peak width can be explained with the help of DFT calculations, which provide the binding energies for the individual carbon atoms in the molecules. For this purpose, the core-electron binding energies were calculated with a localized core-hole in a \uf044SCF scheme and compared to the experimental data by way of a fitting procedure. In this procedure, the relative binding energies and relative intensities (given by the number of symmetry equivalent carbon atoms) were taken as fixed parameters forming the overall theoretical C 1s peak of the molecule as sum over the equivalent carbon sub peaks, each represented by a pseudo-Voigt peak. The single-peakwidth and the Gaussian-to-Lorentzian ratio were constricted to be equal for all sub peaks and were parameters of the fit procedure together with the overall intensity and a global energy shift. As can be seen in Figure ,b, the agreement between experiment and theory is remarkably good, allowing us to explain the peak shape based on the theoretical model.

To date, computational predictors mostly work by identifying the best possible sequence or structural match of the target protein with metal binding templates. These approaches are fundamentally focused on the first coordination sphere of the metal. Here, we present the BioMetAll predictor that is based on a different postulate: the formation of a potential metal-binding site is related to the geometric organization of the protein backbone. We first report the set of convenient geometric descriptors of the backbone needed for the algorithm and their parametrization from a statistical analysis. Then, the successful benchmark of BioMetAll on a set of more than 50 metal-binding X-Ray structures is presented. Because BioMetAll allows structural predictions regardless of the exact geometry of the side chains, it appears extremely valuable for systems which structures (either experimental or theoretical) are not optimal for metal binding sites. We report here its application on three different challenging cases i) the modulation of metal-binding sites during conformational transition in human serum albumin, ii) the identification of possible routes of metal migration in hemocyanins, and iii) the prediction of mutations to generate convenient metal-binding sites for de novo biocatalysts. This study shows that BioMetAll offers a versatile platform for numerous fields of research at the interface between inorganic chemistry and biology, and allows to highlight the role of the preorganization of the protein backbone as a marker for metal binding. \nQuestion:\n Why is the BioMetAll predictor based on the geometric organization of the protein backbone?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The BioMetAll predictor is based on the geometric organization of the protein backbone because this approach allows the formation of potential metal-binding sites, which is different from traditional methods that focus on the first coordination sphere of the metal.", "weight": 1}]}

The astronomical computational cost associated with a full QM treatment of such electronic-nuclear coupled reactions has led, in the last few decades, to the emergence of a myriad of mixed quantum-classical dynamics (MQCD) methods and software . MQCD methods are approximate approaches which offer computational efficiency by treating a handful of degrees of freedom (DOFs) at the QM level and the rest of the condensed-phase system classically. The wide and everexpanding range of MQCD methods offers different and varying levels of quantum accuracy, each being accurate in one area, on a specific model system, or within the boundaries of certain reaction regimes while deviating from the correct physical behavior outside those boundaries. This does not deter the usage of MQCD approaches, considering the insurmountable computational cost of QM calculations.

Encouragingly, Grimme's quantum mechanically derived force field (QMDFF) method is capable of outputting bespoke non-bonded force field parameters for molecules comprising more than 100 atoms. Despite using fixed point charges, with no explicit polarization term, the bespoke force field reproduces both QM inter-and intramolecular energies to an accuracy of around 1 kcal/mol for small molecule benchmarks.In recent years, we have been following a similar strategy to Grimme's QMDFF, focusing more on condensed phase properties and heterogeneous systems. The basis of this approach is the density derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) atoms-in-molecule (AIM) scheme, which partitions the total electron density into approximately-spherical atomcentered basins. Atomic charges are derived by integrating the atomic electron density over all space and, in contrast to direct fitting of the QM electrostatic potential (ESP charges), it is possible to derive chemically-meaningful DDEC atomic electron densities and charges for both surface and buried atoms. A further advantage of this approach is that the Lennard-Jones parameters may also be computed directly from the atomic electron densities, using methods based on the Tkatcheko-Scheffler relations that are commonly used to incorporate dispersion effects into density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Similar to the Grimme approach, these non-bonded parameters are derived from a single QM optimized structure, which would be problematic if the charges show strong conformation dependence.

After this initial spin locking, the system was left unconstrained and allowed to drift toward the magnetic state that minimized its energy.We further investigated the structures' magnetic behavior starting from their pre-optimized geometries (obtained from the discussion above).

There is no assumption needed that we know the constraints on the initial state.

QUBE force fields have been derived for 109 small organic molecules, and yield mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm 3 , 0.79 kcal/mol and 1.17 kcal/mol in computed liquid density, heat of vaporization and free energy of hydration. These results are competitive with standard transferable force fields, which have been extensively fit to properties such as these.To achieve our goal of employing the QUBE force field in computer-aided drug design applications, we require a compatible protein force field. Since the non-bonded parametrization strategy employed in QUBE is very different to that used in the standard biomolecular force fields (e.g. AMBER, OPLS, CHARMM), there is no reason to believe that they are compatible. However, by implementing the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameter derivation methods in the ONETEP linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) software, we have shown that it is feasible to derive these charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for entire proteins. In this way, the number of fitting parameters is substantially reduced, and we have a consistent parametrization approach that can be applied to both small and large molecules, including entire biomolecular assemblies. Since, in this approach, all non-bonded parameters are derived from a single QM calculation, both the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters naturally include the native state polarization effects of the environment.

Here, a rather well studied class of reactions is the adsorption of n-alkanes onto zeolites. As an example the adsorption entropy of n-butane, n-pentane, and n-hexane (Fig. ) in a H-ZSM-5 zeolit cut-out was calculated with GFN-FF. For a given zeolit structure cut-out (e.g., obtained from a crystal structure and saturated with hydrogen atoms) thermodynamic properties can be obtained with the (ms)RRHO approach.Sampling of the configurations in CREST then simply requires some additional geometrical constraints, as was discussed in previous work. This is necessary because the zeolit chunk shall mimic a solid and its structure would be strongly deformed or even broken by the metadynamic simulations and geometry optimizations at GFN level. The confgurational problem is of course complicated by the combinatorical nature of different conformers at different adsorption sites, but in the present case the total system size is small enough to not pose major problems. Adsorption entropies are directly calculated from absolute entropies by \u2206S = S alkane/zeolit -S alkane -S zeolit (see Tab. 4) and assessed with respect to experimental values.

Consequently, the field of prebiotic chemistry has mostly abandoned the idea of autonomous oligonucleotide replication after von Kiedrowski's seminal work and instead has focused on scenarios where the local environment is modulated allowing for changes in the template:product duplex stability and therefore turnover of the replication cycle. Environmental changes including variations in pH, salt concentrations, viscosity, and temperature have led to cycles of hybridization and dissociation of RNA or DNA duplexes and have been proposed as drivers of prebiotic nucleic acid self-replication. All of these scenarios can be rationalized to some extent based on intrinsic temperature cycles and chemical gradients expected on early Earth. Yet, the question of how fragile oligonucleotides could have sustained these slow cyclical processes for many generations of replication remains unclear, making the question of oligonucleotide self-replication far from settled in any prebiotic theory.A strategy that has also been considered to avoid product inhibition in general nonenzymatic oligonucleotide self-replication, is the introduction of oligonucleotide modifications that destabilize the interaction between the template and the growing complement.

In principle, all conformers, i.e., the complete ensemble and the respective energies are required for the calculation of S conf but even for only moderately sized systems this number is prohibitively huge.Practically, the obtained ensemble quality depends mostly on the run time t of the (biased) molecular dynamics (MD) in CREST. Basically, it is the number of optimized snap-shot structures gathered over all runs and will converge to a complete CE with the length of the conformational search. On the other hand, the conformational entropy also exhibits predictable behavior with regard to increasing ensemble completeness. If the lowest energy conformer is known, adding higher-lying conformers to the ensemble can only increase the entropy. If many of the low-energy structures are already found, the entropy increase for additional states is smooth and it seems possible to extrapolate to completeness without explicit knowledge of all conformers. The pre-requisite for this is the generation of enough intermediate points, i.e., consecutive conformational ensembles with systematically improved quality. A smooth and continuous convergence of the entropy to its maximum value can only be observed if conformers are added consistently from all regions of the PES (see Sec. 4.2 for examples).In the implementation of the algorithm, information from incomplete CEs of consecutive iterations is used for an extrapolation of the entropy according toS conf (x) -S conf (0) = p 1 (1 -exp (p 2 x p 3 )) , (15<formula \nQuestion:\n Why does adding higher-lying conformers to the ensemble increase the entropy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Adding higher-lying conformers to the ensemble increases the entropy because if the lowest energy conformer is known, any additional conformers can only contribute to an increase in entropy.

They have a wide variety of roles, notably in providing colours in a range of complex signalling processes, quenching reactive oxygen species, and enhancing light-harvesting efficiency in photosynthesis . Carotenoids have remarkably complex excited-state manifold and dynamics. The lowest-lying excited state, S1 (2 Ag -), is absorption-silent, displaying the same symmetry as the ground state S0 (1 1 Ag -) ; the strong absorption of carotenoids arises from a transition from S0 to the second excited state, S2 (1 Bu + ). The energy of the S0\uf0aeS2 transition depends on the length of the C=C conjugated chain, as well as on the polarisability of the environment . In the simplest cases, this excited S2 state decays by internal conversion (<200 fs) to S1, which itself decays to the ground-state S0 by internal conversion in several picoseconds . However, further \"dark\" states, such as S*, are proposed to account for the intricate network of relaxation pathways observed . In monomeric carotenoids, the ultrafast deactivation of the excited states prevents the formation of triplets via intersystem crossing. Aggregated carotenoids, on the other hand, are able to generate triplets in an ultrafast manner through singlet fission.

However, we believe that modifications by C16 FA and VLCFAs contribute to membrane permeabilization differently during necroptosis. We previously showed that VLCFAs interact with membranes and disrupt their integrity in model liposomes and molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the modest increases of VLCFAs during necroptosis, we proposed that the incorporation of VLCFAs into proteins can facilitate their recruitment to defined membrane domains and allow high local concentrations of these lipids at the membrane and perturb membrane integrity . Translocation of pMLKL oligomers to the plasma membrane is driven by electrostatic interactions between the oligomer interface and negatively charged phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)-rich membrane domains. Several PIP species are known to be actively involved in cell signaling cascades, both in endogenous processes as well as in mechanisms of action of viruses and other pathogens.

Evidence for dynamic ML bond equilibria in MOFs was recently reported as VT-DRIFTS spectra for a series of archetypical carboxylate MOFs. The observed red-shift in the vibrational frequencies of the symmetric and asymmetric C-O stretches suggested the coexistence of \"tight\" and \"loose\" states in thermal equilibrium. This nomenclature was adopted over \"bound\" and \"unbound\" because previously reported molecular dynamics simulations 26 revealed that MOF ML bonds dynamically fluctuate between conformations with a wide range of bond lengths and angles. Accordingly, carboxylate MOFs were interpreted to exist in an equilibrium between two shallow and wide potential energy surfaces that encompass of diverse collections of tightly or loosely bound ML states. The relative abundances of the \"tight\" and \"loose\" states can be extracted by fitting two fixed Gaussians to these data at different temperatures, permitting quantification of a \"flexibility\" constant (ln Kflex, Kflex = [loose]/[tight]), defined as the inverse of the familiar formation constants Kf reported for molecular complexes. In HKUST-1 (Fig. and), an ln Kflex of ~0.3 was observed at room temperature, which compares well to values reported for discrete metal complexes such as zinc and copper benzoates/acetates in the range of 0.1-1.5. This analysis also suggests that unbound states likely comprise a significant portion of MOF structures. To gain insight into the thermodynamics of this equilibrium, Van't Hoff analysis of VT-DRIFTS data of HKUST-1 was performed to assess the temperature dependence of Kflex. This result suggests that the population of loose states is associated with a small endothermic barrier (\u0394H = 5.9 \u00b1 0.2 kJ mol -1 ), overcome by an increase in entropy (\u0394S = 22.0 \u00b1 0.6 J mol -1 \nQuestion:\n How does the ln Kflex value of HKUST-1 at room temperature compare to the range of ln Kflex values reported for discrete metal complexes such as zinc and copper benzoates/acetates?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The ln Kflex value of HKUST-1 is within the range reported for discrete metal complexes.", "weight": 1}]}

They can be conveniently synthesized via a variety of transformations. One of the most prominent and versatile methods is the metal-catalyzed coupling of thiols with aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides, also referred to as Migita-coupling. Until recently aryl bromides and iodides were typically employed as electrophiles rather than the less reactive but abundant aryl chlorides. In comparison to aryl (pseudo)halides, alkenyl electrophiles have been much less systematically explored. One of the disadvantages of halides is the synthesis of not commercially available substrates, which may require multiple steps , forcing reaction conditions 10 restricting the functional group tolerance, as well as toxic chemicals (e.g. CCl4, 11 PCl5 12 ). In contrast, aryl and alkenyl triflates, representatives of pseudohalides, can easily be synthesized in a simple one step procedure from phenols and ketones, rendering them excellent alternative electrophiles. Phenols and ketones are both abundant, available as well as low-cost, and thus attractive building blocks, especially for more complex pharmaceutically active compounds. In particular alkenyl halides, for which even simple compounds are not widely commercially available, triflates are an excellent alternative.

It is important to note that in all of these cases, the direct bandgaps correspond to the smallest spin-polarized bandgap value. Electronic excitation from valence to conduction band in direct bandgap semiconductors does not require electrons' momentum to change, e.g. via phonon interactions. Therefore, this type of semiconductors are preferred for applications that require efficient photon absorption and photon emission. Our materials have a wide range of direct bandgap values, from 0.20 to 2.02 eV. Three of these materials have the ability to absorb and emit photons in the visible range: Cr-03, Ti-03, and V-03; since their smallest spin-polarized bandgap value falls between 1.65 and 3.26 eV (visible light spectrum). Interestingly, these materials have a similar structure, as they present a TM-03 intercalation pattern (with the intercalants positioned at the centroid of all benzene rings). The spin-polarized band structures and projected DOS for these materials are plotted in Figure . In this figure, we observe the important role of the transition metals, which provide electron density from their 3d-orbitals near the Fermi level. The transition metals and carbon atoms provide the largest electron density at the CBM/VBM. Thus, it is evident that the carbon 2p-orbitals in the COF layers hybridize with the TM d-orbitals, providing the unique direct-semiconducting electronic structures observed. These results confirm our hypothesis that promoting pd orbital interactions between the COFs and TMs leads to a modification of the electronic structure and properties of these systems. Furthermore, Ti-04a, V-04a, and V-01a-which are also direct semiconductors-have their larger spin-polarized bandgaps in the visible range and, although less likely, these visible-range direct transitions can also occur for these materials.From Table <ref \nQuestion:\n Which materials have the ability to absorb and emit photons in the visible range?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Cr-03, Ti-03, and V-03", "weight": 1}]}

The O 2 content was kept below 0.5 ppm. Steady-state absorbance spectra were recorded on a Cary Varian 1E UV-visible spectrophotometer (supplementary material Sec. 2). The pathlength used for spectroscopic measurements was 0.03 mm for the 8 mM samples and 2 mm for the 0.05 mM samples.

A portion of the output was doubled to 515 nm and introduced to a home-made optical parametric amplifier to obtain 810 nm, which was doubled to a 405 nm pump beam. The probe was a white light continuum obtained by focusing a portion of the 1030 nm output onto a 1 cm pathlength cuvette of D 2 O. The white light continuum was then focused onto the sample with a 0.2 mm spot size, and detected with a spectrograph (Oriel, 77400) and camera (Andor, Zyla 5.5 sCMOS). Experiments were performed with the pump polarization rotated to the magic angle (54.7 \u2022 ) relative to the probe.

Amber stop codons were introduced at A100, V83 or Q111 by site-directed mutagenesis. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were co-transformed with the pEVOL-BpyAla plasmid, which contains the orthogonal MjTyrRS/MjtRNA Tyr genes , and the pET28 plasmid carrying the SCP gene with a C-terminal TEV cleavable His6 tag. The genes were expressed in the presence of 0.5 mM BpyAla and the resulting proteins purified by Ni-affinity chromatography with the His6 tag removed using TEVprotease. Typical yields were 5-15 mg L -1 in LB media, representing a decrease of 20-80% compared to the yields of SCP-2L without BpyAla.

It is clear that in order to better understand the spectroscopic properties of lycopene aggregates, it is necessary to design an alternative experimental protocol where each aggregate type can be observed selectively. This would allow us to propose more sophisticated models than the current linear scheme. The selective purification of each species of lycopene aggregate would clearly be ideal, but this may well turn out to be extremely complex given the number of different aggregate types formed here and reported in the literature. An alternative would be to use time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy, which should be sensitive enough to separate and distinguish the different excited states involved. Indeed, the selectivity of resonance Raman spectroscopy, and its sensitivity to the different arrangements of lycopene aggregates in their ground state, is illustrated very clearly in Figure .

The ET rate from the Au electrode to the covalently bound EtnFc across the SAM has been determined using chronoamperometry. Chronoamperometry is a very useful tool for the determination of apparent ET rate (kapp) from an electrode to a redox active species bound to various SAMs modified electrode. In CA experiments, the faradaic current decays according to the following exponential relationship. i = kapp Q exp (-kappt) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..

The CA current decay comprises two types of processes, one for the overall capacitive current decay and the other is due to the faradaic current decay of the attached redox active moiety.

This helps to determine the kapp of ET from the electrode to the attached redox active species by simply choosing the appropriate time scale of decay. The plot of Ln(i) vs. time is linear and its slope yields the value of kapp. Chronoamperograms of N3C11SH-C8SH SAM-modified Au electrodes demonstrate a complete decay of charging currents within 0.2 ms time scale (Fig. ) whereas the faradaic currents decay completely at 7.5 ms when EtnFc covalently bound to it (Fig. ). The ET rate from the modified Au electrode to the EtnFc in pH 7 phosphate buffer is determined from the slope of the corresponding semilogarithmic plot of Ln(i) vs. time and is found to be 1030 s -1 which reduced to 575 s -1 when EtnFc bound N3C11SD-C8SD \nQuestion:\n What is the ET rate from the modified Au electrode to the EtnFc in pH 7 phosphate buffer before it was reduced?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: 1030 s-1", "weight": 1}]}

In terms of limitations, primary sulfinamides undergo the crossover reaction, however with a significant amount of side-products. Also, sulfinamides with electron-rich aromatic N-substituents led to unwanted side-products of the same mass, as indicated by HPLC-MS analysis.

Bespoke charges are usually assumed to be compatible with the fixed Lennard-Jones parameters of the force field, although these themselves have also been shown to be dependent on the local environment of the atom. Although proteins must also experience polarization effects in both the charges and Lennard-Jones parameters, protein force field parameters have always, to date, been assigned from a transferable library. This leads to an inconsistency in the parametrization strategy used for protein force fields and bespoke small molecule force fields. This is potentially problematic when studying properties that depend on the electrostatic potentials of proteins, such as their interactions with small molecules, and there is no clear way around this using traditional force field fitting methods.To improve the consistency between charge and Lennard-Jones parameters, and also reduce the reliance on fitting to experimental data, one could either directly fit non-bonded MM parameters to reproduce quantum mechanical (QM) energies and forces, or derive the non-bonded parameters of the force field directly from QM. In the latter approach, the QM interaction energy may be broken down into physically motivated components using intermolecular perturbation theory, though these methods are limited to quite small system sizes. \nQuestion:\n Why does the inconsistency in the parametrization strategy used for protein force fields and bespoke small molecule force fields potentially cause problems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The inconsistency in parametrization strategies between protein force fields and bespoke small molecule force fields is potentially problematic because it affects the study of properties that depend on the electrostatic potentials of proteins, such as their interactions with small molecules.", "weight": 1}]}

Figure shows two frontier natural orbitals and their occupations for the ground X 1 \u03a3 + g state of MgCCMg; natural orbitals of CaCCCa and SrCCSr are shown in Figure in the SI. In all three molecules, the antibonding natural orbital has a higher occupation number than the bonding orbital in contrast to the case of Li 2 , where, in the agreement with the molecular orbital theory, the bonding natural orbital lies below the antibonding orbital. Such an effect of the flipped orbital ordering has been observed in systems where the (indirect) through-bond interaction between electrons dominates a weak (direct) through-space interaction; for example, it is clearly seen in para-benzyne . Indeed, orbital hybridization induced by the negatively charged linker directs the distribution of the two electrons away from each other, thus minimizing the orbital overlap and through-space interaction.The occupation numbers in all three ACCAs are very close to those of a perfectly diradical wavefunction (i.e., n 1 = n 2 = 1) and, correspondingly, the Head-Gordon's indices are close to the limiting value of 2 (Table in SI). The observed small deviations from the perfect diradical values reflect that the interaction between two unpaired electrons is weak but is not negligible. As such, the electronic wavefunction of the X 1 \u03a3 + g state in all three ACCA molecules is dominated by the covalent configuration with a small contribution from the ionic (chargeresonance) configuration.

The excitation energies for H 2 /6-31G system are identical to the FCI results showing absolute errors less than 10 -5 mE h since SD level of theory recovers FCI regime for the two-particle systems. The suggested algorithms also produce nearly exact excitation energies for LiH/STO-3G system showing all errors are within the shaded region (M AX(error) \u223c 0.17 mE h and M AX(error) \u223c 0.30 mE h for the non-variational and variational, respectively). From Fig. ) and (d), one can clearly see that the errors in excitation energies exceed the target accuracy, 1.6 mE h , for the H 4 /STO-3G and the H 2 O/STO-3G at certain inter-nuclear distances due to the strong electron correlation. In the case of water molecule, it is known from standard EOM-CCSD that triple excitations are significant in the bond-breaking regime . In the case of the H 4 /STO-3G system, one needs to take into account triple excitations for T 1 , T 2 , S 2 , and S 3 states. In addition, even quadruple level of excitations (FCI level) need to be considered to achieve the target accuracy for S 1 with a much smaller subspace resulting in the electronic configurations, which are expected to recover the electronic correlations of the current excited state. That is, the dimension of the working space remains within a practical regime for classical computers. The numerical example of H 4 /STO-3G with SDTQ level of excitations is shown in Fig. .Note that the dimension of the working space does not grow significantly with the Davidson method. However, the increase in the level of excitations leads to the increase in the number of projections to be measured in the residual vector calculations of Eq.

The deviation of the \u03be full curve from the Tersoff/ZBL curve is consequently not as much as other AC and SDAC curves after 0.1 ps. This is not an advantage, however, since other aspects of the dynamics (such as v max ) become worse.The number of defects stabilizes as the system cools down to 300 K at about 10 ps. For SDAC with/without transition forces, the numbers of defects left at 10 ps are either in between that of the SW and the Tersoff/ZBL potentials or very close to that of the SW potential. For AC simulations, however, the numbers of defects left at 10 ps are much less. This demonstrates the deficiency of the AC method in the simulation of DD generation. The AC method can only partition the system according to geometrical criteria. With the AC method, the collision of atoms is treated with the higher-level method only after atoms are very close to each other, and is treated with the lowerlevel method when atoms are not close enough (Fig. ), so the description of the collision process is inconsistent. This affects the geometries of the defect clusters and leads to the much faster healing of damage.

Cu intercalation is non-magnetic throughout all configurations. Finally, Cr, Fe, Mn, Sc, and Ti intercalations can be FM, AFM, or FiM, depending on TM concentration.Furthermore, in these compounds, the magnetic behavior of intercalated atoms can be highly dependent not only on their concentration, but also on their position. In particular, we highlight that some TM atoms have reduced unpaired electron density depending on their position. For example, for Cr intercalation, the \u03b1\u03b2 (unpaired) electron population is larger for Cr atoms intercalated at the centroid of boroxine or triazine rings, compared to those intercalated at the centroid of benzene rings, with the exception of Cr-02 where magnetic moments are reduced in triazine rings.

Finally, for Ti intercalation, the only atoms that show open-shell configurations are those intercalated at the centroid of boroxine rings.

Molecular optimization (both for minima and saddle points) is generally performed in a basis of internal coordinates, which typically comprise bond stretch distances, bending angles, and dihedral angles, as internal coordinates are significantly less energetically correlated than Cartesian coordinates. These chemically relevant features provide a more effective coordinate system for optimization at the cost of additional algorithmic complexity. We have recently developed a new method for realizing displacements in a basis of redundant internal coordinates which dramatically reduces the number of steps required to reach convergence on a minimization benchmark. In this work, we extend this algorithm to optimization of saddle point geometries.Our optimization algorithm is designed to be used in automated frameworks without the need for manual intervention. However, the complexity of optimization in a basis of internal coordinates frequently frustrates attempts at automation. For example, when a bending angle of a molecule becomes linear or nearly linear during the course of optimization, displacement of the bending angle coordinate becomes ill-defined. To solve this problem, it is necessary to redefine the internal coordinate system to replace the linear bending angle with a different coordinate. Occasionally, this may require the addition of fictional \"dummy atoms\" that act as scaffolding off of which the replacement coordinate can be defined. The process of adding dummy atoms and dealing with the \nQuestion:\n What action is taken when the bending angle of a molecule becomes linear or nearly linear during optimization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The internal coordinate system is redefined to replace the linear bending angle with a different coordinate.", "weight": 1}]}

The flexibility in the desired properties has previously been achieved by variation of substituents at the periphery of the pyrene backbone. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the central \uf070-electron system on the relevant properties such as the band gap or the fluorescence behavior has not yet been addressed. In this work, pyrene is compared with its structural isomer azupyrene, which has a \uf070-electron system with nonalternant topology. Using photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and other methods, it is shown that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of pyrene. The difference of the optical band gaps is even larger with 1.09 eV, as determined by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. The nonalternant nature of azupyrene is also associated with a more localized charge distribution, as can be seen in 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance shifts, as well as the C1s core-level shifts. Further insight is provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the molecular properties and ab initio coupled cluster calculations of the optical transitions.

Consequently, we prepared Ter-P(NR2)2 [R = Me (1a), Et (1b)] by treatment of isolated Ter-Li with ClP(NR2)2 (R = Me, Et; an HClfree P-source) in toluene at ambient temperature (Scheme 1, reaction 1). In case of 1a, filtration over a celite-padded frit and removal of the solvent resulted in the isolation of an analytically pure colourless so lid in 67% yield. For 1b, after stirring for 1.5 h, the solvent was removed and the residue was extracted with n-hexane, concentrated to incipient crystallization and standing at 5 \u00b0C overnight afforded 1b as an analytically pure colourless crystalline solid, in a moderate yield of 40%. We found that consistently higher yields are obtained by starting from Ter-I. Lithiation of Ter-I with 2.5 M n BuLi (in n-hexane) in Et2O at 0\u00b0C and subsequent treatment with ClP(NR2)2 afforded 1a (79 %) and 1b (89 %) in good isolated yields (Scheme 1, reaction 2).

In 1a a doublet corresponding to the two NMe2 groups is detected, indicating C2 symmetry in solution.

In the case of ACCB, such a reaction is ACCB + HCCH \u2192 ACCH + BCCH.(Interestingly, all computed DSEs are negative and increase in magnitude in the Mg\u2192Ca\u2192Sr series from -1 kcal/mol to -6 kcal/mol (Table ). This is puzzling, because in organic diradicals only positive DSEs, indicating stabilizing interaction of the radical centers, were observed and because singlet-triplet gaps in ACCA indicate weak bonding interactions. We attribute negative DSEs to strongly ionic nature of the AC bonds, which results in negative charges of the acetylene linker, resulting in the strong Coulomb repulsion. The analysis of Mulliken's chargesshows increased ionic character in the Mg\u2192Ca\u2192Sr series, which correlates with increasingly negative DSEs (Table ).

In this work, we look to challenge this assumption by deriving system-specific non-bonded parameters, from linear-scaling QM simulations, for consistency with the QUBE small molecule force field. These non-bonded terms were used here alongside libraries of (non-bespoke) bond and angle parameters, derived using the modified Seminario method, and newly reparametrized torsional terms.We have shown here that using system-specific non-bonded force field parameters can result in accurate conformational preferences for short peptides. Rotamer populations and simulated J couplings for the dipeptide molecules are in good agreement with experimental data and compare favorably with the latest OPLS force field. For longer peptide molecules, the problems associated with fitting torsional parameters to a system-specific force field became more apparent. Using regularization in the fitting process was shown to overcome these issues and resulted in a J coupling error of just 0.90 \u00b1 0.03 for the alanine pentapeptide. Further work investigating disordered peptides will ascertain how general this fix is.The accuracy of the peptide simulations supports the use of our non-bonded and modified Seminario bonded parametrization strategies.

Reforming: hydrogen is produced by reacting a fossil fuel with steam, thereby releasing hydrogen as well as carbon monoxide, a mixture commonly referred to as 'syngas':CmHn + mH2O -> mCO + (m+n/2)H2(1)2. Partial oxidation: in this process, a fossil fuel is combusted with a sub-stoichiometric amount of oxygen, leading to the production of syngas:CmHn + m/2O2 -> mCO + n/2H2 (2)Steam methane reforming (SMR) is the leading process to produce grey hydrogen. In 2021, the global hydrogen demand reached a peak of 94 Mt. Currently, about 48% of the hydrogen produced worldwide (~45 Mt in 2021) comes from SMR. This process consists of dehydrogenating methane (commonly from a natural gas stream) to produce a hydrogen-rich mixture, and it is the cheapest at the industrial scale. However, its environmental impact is very high: every kg of H2 produced in this way generates around 8 kg of CO2, indirectly. Oil and coal gasification are still heavily used, accounting for the 30% (~28 Mt) and 18% (~17 Mt) of the world's hydrogen production in 2021, respectively. Typically, grey hydrogen production processes include additional steps (e.g., water-gas shift and acid gas removal) to maximize the hydrogen yield and separate the carbon oxides from the hydrogen stream.Among the traditional methods of producing grey hydrogen (reforming and partial oxidation), autothermal reforming (ATR) is used in less proportion.

These results show quite clearly that initial rates observed for c/w and pulsed laser experiments, carried out under similar experimental conditions are very close to each other. Although comparison is limited to relatively lower intensities that are available from our c/w laser, the close correspondence among the observed rates suggests that this trend should also hold true at higher intensities too. Based on these observations, we believe that any major differences resulting from the pulsed vs c/w nature of light used in our experiments can be ruled out.Consequently, any underestimation of T eff in case of pulsed laser based experiments can also be ruled out.Above presented results clearly show that activation energy for light-induced reaction is much lower than the thermally-driven case. We interpret this large difference in activation energies as a signature of different reaction pathways followed under thermally driven and light induced conditions. These observations are also qualitatively consistent with the earlier proposed hypothesis based on first principles calculations, where it was suggested that plasmonic excitation causes transient electron transfer to the adsorbate molecules leading to bond weakening, thereby lowering the activation barrier and leading to enhanced reaction rates compared to the thermal reaction pathway. Dashed lines depict linear fit to the data points obtained with pulsed laser, and have been included to indicate the trend. For a given incident intensity, the observed initial rates using pulsed or c/w laser are very similar.

Since each of the phosphate groups along the backbone has a -1 charge, a single Na + cation was added near these groups to ensure charge neutrality of the entire periodic system.

UPS and NEXAFS show that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of the alternant molecule pyrene, and theory predicts a very similar difference of 0.87 eV. The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding an even larger difference of 1.09 eV. One reason why this difference is larger for azupyrene is due to symmetry selection rules, which result in a forbidden HOMO\u2192LUMO transition and the lack of fluorescence for azupyrene. These special properties of azupyrene's electronic structure are related to the nonalternant topology of its \uf070-electron system. The topology of azupyrene also leads to a more localized charge distribution, visible in the experimental XPS and NMR shifts as well as in the DFT-calculated partial charges, all showing a negative charge surplus at the apices of the 7-membered rings and positive charge at the central C2-unit. The conjugated system of pyrene is best described as a biphenyl with two ethenediyl bridges, whereas azupyrene is a [14]annulene with a central double-bonded C2 unit. This interpretation follows from HOMA considerations, bond length changes, and the vibrational modes seen in experimental and calculated IR spectra. Overall, we found that the topology of the \uf070electron system drastically influences the electronic structure of the two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Those differences in electronic structure are reflected in the absorption and fluorescence behavior, a lower electron-hole binding energy, and a lower barrier to electron-hole separation for azupyrene. The possible application of nonalternant molecules in organic electronic devices is favored by those differences.

Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP, 2) was synthesized by the Adler-Longo method. 3b Previous methodology for accessing PorSils relied on the use of a highly reactive lithium amide to deprotonate the porphyrin prior to reaction with HSiCl3, which was found to be a better porphyrin silylating reagent than the perhaps more intuitive building block SiCl4. Sun and co-workers found that porphyrin silylation could be accomplished by combining the porphyrin and HSiCl3 in the presence of Pr3N. They relied on chromatography to purify the resulting TPP-Si(Cl)2 (2-SiCl2), an inefficient approach that also notably did not work in our hands as the modified porphyrin covalently reacted with the solid support. We accomplished the silylation of 2 using HSiCl3 with Et3N, a common laboratory reagent (Scheme 1). After aqueous workup, residual Et3N can be readily removed by evaporation. Using this method we were able to avoid the necessity for chromatography, and instead were able to isolate our desired product by simple liquid-liquid extraction, resulting in up to an 85% yield of 2-SiCl2. The generalization of this reaction in combination with the simplification of the purification procedure are steps forward for the prospects of developing this class of molecules. To synthesize the SOPS, 2-SiCl2 was converted quantitively to 3 by refluxing in a THF/water mixture, and subsequently silylated using Et3N and the respective silyl chloride (Scheme 1). These final compounds were air-stable and purified by column chromatography using silica gel and alkaline eluents (see Supporting Information); large scale purification could be accomplished by recrystallization.It is worth commenting on the more practical aspects of this synthesis, particularly in reference to key intermediate \nQuestion:\n Why was the method of silylation using HSiCl3 with Et3N preferred over the previous method using a highly reactive lithium amide?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The method using HSiCl3 with Et3N was preferred because it allowed the avoidance of chromatography, simplifying the purification process and enabling the isolation of the desired product by simple liquid-liquid extraction, resulting in up to an 85% yield of 2-SiCl2.

Owing to the synergistic effect of the AIE-molecular rotors (PE) and ACQ-based chromophore units (carbazole), JUC-557-nanosheet demonstrates high absolute quantum yields (up to 23.0%) in both solid-state and solution. Also, electron-rich carbazole and electron-deficient cyan are uniformly distributed and exposed on the channel wall, rendering efficient combining with the analytes for detection. Therefore, JUC-557nanosheet as a sensitive fluorescence sensor exhibits an excellent molecular recognition toward the essential element in the human body (Fe 3+ with K a of 1.98 \uf0b4 10 4 M -1 and LOD of 706 ppb), radioactive contaminant (I 2 with K a of 2.10 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and LOD of 302 ppb), explosive (TNT with K a of 4.38 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and LOD of 129 ppb), and especially toxic nitro-compounds (such as NB with K a of 6.18 \uf0b4 10 6 M -1 and LOD of 5 ppb), which is far superior to previous fluorescence detection materials, including COFs, MOFs, POPs, small molecule probes, and inorganics. Due to its high chemical stability, JUC-557nanosheet exhibits a good luminescence and sensitive molecule recognition even under extreme conditions, such as in strong acid with pH = 1 or strong base with pH = 14. Moreover, JUC-557-nanosheet can be assembled into visual detection equipment, allowing easy optical trace detection of various analytes. Finally, the molecular recognition mechanism was investigated by a combined theoretical and experimental studies, including TRPL measurements, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations.

In the minimal set we find that for our toy model the operators have Lagrange multipliers that can be neglected as shown in Fig. This is unlike the operators that are quite dominant. The difference is due to that the electronic transition is accompanied by a gain or loss of one vibrational quantum as can be seen from the oscillation frequency of the Lagrange multiplier for the constraint, . It is higher from the electronic gap by one quantum of vibration and corresponds to the period of 4 fs. Consistent with this selectivity, the Lagrange multipliers for the pair are again negligible. The vibrational selectivity is rather likely a reflection of the linearity in the nuclear dispacement of the coupling between the two electronic states.

General metal complexes with Buchwald-type ligands (A), related gold complexes from the literature (B, C), and synthetic targets of this study (D).In Au(I) catalysis a major drawback is the decay of the gold catalyst, which results from reduction of the cationic gold center to gold(0).

For the intermolecular amination of alkynes electron-rich phosphines with a 2-biphenyl moiety are considered superior.

In Equation ( ), n is the number of bonds (with lengths Ri) in the conjugation path. The parameter \uf061 is an empirical constant chosen to give H = 1 for the ideal aromatic system of benzene (with six equal bond lengths) and H = 0 for the hypothetical Kekul\u00e9 cyclohexatriene structure of benzene (with three single and three double bonds). The physical meaning of H is based on the fact that bonds in a conjugated \uf070-electron system have lengths between pure \uf073and \uf070-bonds, which means that the \uf073-bonds are compressed and the \uf070-bonds are extended in the final equilibrium structure. Both the \uf073-bond compression and the \uf070-bond extension cost energy. Ropt represents the optimum bond lengths, at which compression of the typical \uf073-bond to the value of Ropt is equal to the energy of extension of a typical \uf070-bond to Ropt. For the HOMA values discussed below, we used the bond lengths obtained from the DFToptimized structures of the two molecules (PBE functional).

Therefore, the reliability of static computational strategy depends on whether the ideal models are deviated from the realistic conditions. In comparison, MD simulations is a well-tested approach to obtain the thermodynamics as well as the kinetics of the target system by going beyond ideal models. The reliability of the dynamic computational strategy in statistical thermodynamics depends on whether the converged sampling can be achieved.The dynamic computational strategy based on AIMD simulations has been used to face some issues in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the expensive computational cost in AIMD simulations greatly limited its wide applications. The NN PES provides an accurate and efficient computational approach by avoiding most expensive ab initio calculations. Therefore, a dynamic computational strategy by combination of NN PES and MD simulations has been proposed here for efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent thermodynamics for heterogeneous catalysis. We have constructed a 6-D NN PES for CO adsorbate on Ru(0001) surface, which can fully reproduce the potential energy and gradients at ab initio level.Base on it, converged sampling by MD simulation has been carried out for the temperaturedependent thermodynamics of CO adsorption and diffusion on the surface. Benefit from our highly efficient dynamic computational strategy, the temperature-dependent thermodynamics have been obtained from a total of 3.5\u00d710 3 ns long MD simulations at each of seven temperatures, that is 300 \u223c 900 K.We obtained the \nQuestion:\n Why has the expensive computational cost in AIMD simulations greatly limited its wide applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The expensive computational cost in AIMD simulations has greatly limited its wide applications because it makes it less accessible and feasible for broader use in various scenarios, particularly where resources are limited.", "weight": 1}]}

Both of these HOCO and LUCO localization patterns are consistent with previous work  It is worth noting that the ssDNA structures with purine nucleobases (i.e., A and G) have a significantly lower hole mobility than the corresponding structures with pyrimidine nucleobases (i.e., T and C). This is due to the HOCOs in poly(A) and poly(G) being formed from the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of A and G (cf. Figure ), which have an antibonding interaction in the helical ssDNA stacked geometry. Conversely, the ssDNA structures with purine nucleobases have a significantly higher electron mobility than the corresponding structures with pyrimidine nucleobases. This trend arises from the LUCOs in poly(A) and poly(G) having a larger overlap than the corresponding LUCOs in poly(T) and poly(C), as can be seen in Figure .Furthermore, both A and G contain more sp 2 hybridized segments with highly electronegative atomic species (i.e., nitrogen and oxygen) than C and T. For example, A contains three sp 2 C=N units, and G has two C=N and one C=O unit; in contrast, C includes one C=O, one C=N, and one C=C unit, and T contains one C=C and two C=O units. This results in a partial negative charge on the nitrogen and oxygen atoms and a partial positive charge on the neighboring carbon atoms. In turn, this polarity of the sp 2 hybridized atoms can facilitate noncovalent interactions between nucleobases, leading to a larger electron mobility due to its increased electron affinity. As such, these chemical insights corroborate our results showing that purine \nQuestion:\n The ssDNA structures with which nucleobases have a significantly higher electron mobility than the corresponding structures with pyrimidine nucleobases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Purine nucleobases", "weight": 1}]}

Moreover, in the current scenario of water scarcity worldwide, purified water is a critical commodity: about one-in-four people (~2 billions) do not currently have access to clean, potable water. Unfortunately, this situation might worsen in the near future, due to the global warming and related climate change. Therefore, direct seawater splitting has the potential to be less reliant on centralized production facilities, making it a cheap, sustainable, and readily available option for de-centralized green hydrogen production. Cheap and Earth-abundant oxide-based semiconducting light absorbers could be pivotal for this technology: the main advantage of direct PC/PEC seawater splitting is that it does not require external sources of electricity to sustain the electrolysis, as schematically reported in Figure for a single junction device.Instead, the process is powered directly by sunlight, which is free, abundant (1.0 kW\u2022m -2 at AM1.5), and renewable. In addition, due to the high concentration of NaCl in seawater (~0.5 mol\u2022L -1 ) , this process could provide chlorine gas as a side (anodic) product, a commodity used to disinfect water, for the sanitation of sewage and industrial waste, and for production of derived chemicals and polymers. This side production could add a significant contribution to the value chain of hydrogen.The aforementioned green hydrogen production methods face the common challenge of high energy costs required to split water. According to thermodynamics, the energy input required for this reaction is equivalent to an applied voltage of 1.23 V.

Structural features including average bond distances and average angles for the sixty-three intercalated bilayers are displayed in Table of the supplementary information. To summarize the information in Table , Next, we pay attention to two important features that describe TM interactions with the 2D COF: 1) binding energy (BE) of transition metal intercalants in the 2D COF structure, and 2) average interlayer distance (ILD) between the two COF layers. The third column of Table shows the average interlayer distance (ILD) between COF layers for all intercalant concentrations. As a reference, the pure 2D COF has an ILD of 3.34 \u00c5. Furthermore, in Figure we plot the relative binding energy per intercalant for all 2D COF TM intercalations calculated in this work. Binding energy was estimated using the following equation:E B n = - E T M2DCOF -E layers -E intercalants n(1)In Equation , E B n is the BE per transition metal atom intercalated in the structure, E T M2DCOF is the total energy of the optimized TM-intercalated 2D COF, E layers is the energy of the 2D COF layers without intercalants (keeping the same ILD as in E T M2DCOF ), and E intercalants is the energy of the transition metals. Due to the negative sign on the right side of Eq. 1, more positive BEs indicate stronger interactions. From Figure , it can be observed that TM-03 configurations (intercalation at the centroid of benzene rings only) in general have larger BE than other configurations, with the only exception being Fe, \nQuestion:\n How does the binding energy of TM-03 configurations compare to other configurations in the 2D COF structure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: TM-03 configurations generally have a larger binding energy than other configurations, with the exception of Fe.", "weight": 1}]}

The HPLC separation of OLED compounds, especially in the case of structural homologs/analogs and geometric/optical isomers of OLEDs, often entails compromised resolution due to the lack of selectivity (tend to co-elute). Chromatographic method development for such structurally similar compounds and isomers is laborious and timeconsuming. Moreover, impurities or degradation products are often structurally very similar to the analytes; as a result, they elute on the front or tail of the main analyte peak or potentially remain hidden under the target chromatographic peak. In such a scenario, it becomes practically difficult for the analysts to detect and remove impurities from the main peak, especially in the preparative scale when the higher mass load becomes critical. In addition to the chromatographic resolution, HPLC analysis of OLEDs, in most cases, involves normal phase chromatography that utilizes 100% organic solvents as the mobile phase due to the low solubility of the most OLED compounds in the aqueous-based solvents. Utilization of such a high volume of organic solvent is hazardous from the environmental perspective and costly.Sivasubramaniam, et al. utilized three columns in series and used 100% acetonitrile as the mobile phase to separate a standard mixture of only four OLED compounds in about 50 minutes -this is an example of HPLC separation of OLEDs with a considerable waste of time and resources. Therefore, the utilization of preparative HPLC for the purification of OLEDs becomes a poor choice due to the requirement of excessive energy and high dry-down time to deal with such a high volume of organic solvent.

At above 1.0 A cm -2 , the bubble coverage became excessive, notably decreasing the active surface area of the electrode. Flowing liquid electrolyte over the electrode significantly decreased the bubble coverage with the fractional coverage dependent on the velocity of flow. In early 2019, Li et al. reported a 'breathable' oxygen-evolving anode that was prepared by sputter coating a thin gold layer onto a porous, hydrophobic polyethylene (PE) membrane, followed by electrodepositing a NiFeOx catalyst onto the gold layer. The 'breathable' nature of the electrode derived from the fact that the resulting NiFeOx/Au/PE electrode produced oxygen from water without producing visible gas bubbles at room temperature; the oxygen was drawn, as it was generated, through the porous PE membrane into a gas chamber at its rear. In so doing, the electrode exhibited a 90 mV lower overpotential at 0.01 A cm -2 than when a non-porous PE substrate was used. The non-porous PE substrate forced the formation of oxygen bubbles as no pathway existed to extract the gas from the NiFeOx catalyst layer and this is why it displayed a higher overpotential.At around the same time, Tiwari et al. reported a comparison between a 'bubble-free' cell employing Gortex gas diffusion electrodes and conventional, bubble-generating electrolysis cells. They calculated that the contribution of bubble formation to the activation overpotential was ~0. 16 V at 80 o C, excluding the effect of impedance. The energy efficiency decrease caused by bubble formation in conventional, bubble-generating electrolysers was estimated to be \u226511.9% (vs. the Lower Heating Value, LHV, of hydrogen).Most recently, a novel class of 'bubble-free' electrolysis cell, known as a capillary-fed cell, has \nQuestion:\n When did Li et al. report a 'breathable' oxygen-evolving anode that was prepared by sputter coating a thin gold layer onto a porous, hydrophobic polyethylene (PE) membrane, followed by electrodepositing a NiFeOx catalyst onto the gold layer?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: In early 2019", "weight": 1}]}

It is not possible to normalise the experimentally determined quantum state in this way as the initial state is not determined. Instead, the fitted state was normalised by the magnitude of the calculated expectation values, and so is insensitive to an overall loss in magnetisation. This relative normalisation process can dramatically increase the experimental fidelity, especially for the simulations of the entangling gate considering anisotropic coupling frequencies. The uniformly and orientationally weighted simulations with \ud835\udf14 C = 2 MHz have simulated pseudofidelities of just 0.746 and 0.820, but normalised pseudo-fidelities of 0.963 and 0.927.such we consider it more feasible to reduce the spread of couplings by orienting the ensemble, either in a single-or liquid-crystal.Orienting the sample would also narrow the spectra of anisotropic spin systems as angular distributions of spin Hamiltonian parameters will also be reduced to a single value. The oriented spectrum will still be broadened by couplings to neighbouring electron and nuclear spins, as well as the presence of different molecular conformations which will introduce distributions in \ud835\udc54-values, hyperfine couplings, and zero-field splitting parameters where relevant. As such, it is likely that the reduction of partial excitation of near resonant spin packets will require both orientation of the sample and enhanced uniformity of excitation.The bandwidth of rectangular pulses can be increased by reducing pulse lengths, however sufficiently broadband pulses would need to be of picosecond length. Not only is this not attainable using available hardware, it is also undesirable as such short pulses would not \nQuestion:\n What happens to the spectra of anisotropic spin systems when the sample is oriented?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Orienting the sample narrows the spectra of anisotropic spin systems as angular distributions of spin Hamiltonian parameters are reduced to a single value.", "weight": 1}]}

This custom Raman-compatible substrate is based on a gold layer that blocks interfering signal from the underlying glass slide . This gold layer is coated with a thin SiO 2 layer that allows the covalent attachment of a PA gel without producing a substantial background signal . This renders the substrates suitable for the construction of the aforementioned microarray platform for screening HSC fate decisions and other types of stem cells with noninvasive Raman spectroscopy. To fabricate the substrates, thermal vapor deposition was used to deposit a 5-nm-thick chromium (Cr) adhesion layer on the glass substrate, followed a 50nm-thick gold (Au) layer. The thickness of each layer was monitored during deposition with a quartz crystal thickness monitor. These layer thicknesses were validated by using X-ray reflectivity, and good agreement was found (Figure ). Then a 100-nm-thick silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) layer was deposited on top of the gold layer using PECVD. Based on use of this fabrication process to create a single batch of substrates, we calculate our cost is $3.35 per substrate, which is approximately 8 times less expensive than the commercially available (Thorlabs) protected gold mirror substrate (Table ). Of course, the cost would further decrease for both academic and nonacademic users if multiple batches were fabricated at a time.

The thickness of the films was between 30 and 70 nm. The lack of order in the films was proven by the lack of dichroism in NEXAFS measurements. All measurements for the thin films were performed at a temperature of below 200 K to prevent desorption of molecules from the thin film. XPS and UPS were performed with a SPECS PHOIBOS 150 electron energy analyzer equipped with a MCD-9 multi channeltron detector. For XPS, monochromatic Al-K\u03b1 radiation from a SPECS XR 50 M X-ray anode with a FOCUS 500 monochromator was employed. For UPS, He-I radiation from a SPECS UVS 10/35 gas discharge source was used.

They can be conveniently synthesized via a variety of transformations. One of the most prominent and versatile methods is the metal-catalyzed coupling of thiols with aryl and alkenyl (pseudo)halides, also referred to as Migita-coupling. Until recently aryl bromides and iodides were typically employed as electrophiles rather than the less reactive but abundant aryl chlorides. In comparison to aryl (pseudo)halides, alkenyl electrophiles have been much less systematically explored. One of the disadvantages of halides is the synthesis of not commercially available substrates, which may require multiple steps , forcing reaction conditions 10 restricting the functional group tolerance, as well as toxic chemicals (e.g. CCl4, 11 PCl5 12 ). In contrast, aryl and alkenyl triflates, representatives of pseudohalides, can easily be synthesized in a simple one step procedure from phenols and ketones, rendering them excellent alternative electrophiles. Phenols and ketones are both abundant, available as well as low-cost, and thus attractive building blocks, especially for more complex pharmaceutically active compounds. In particular alkenyl halides, for which even simple compounds are not widely commercially available, triflates are an excellent alternative. This point is supported by a variety of publications reporting the transformation of alkenyl triflates to the corresponding alkenyl halides, showcasing the synthetic potential and \nQuestion:\n Which are more reactive as electrophiles, aryl bromides and iodides or aryl chlorides?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Aryl bromides and iodides are more reactive as electrophiles compared to aryl chlorides.", "weight": 1}]}

There are several algorithms for the enforcement of constraints on molecular geometry optimization. RAT-TLE and SHAKE are two well-known algorithms that rigorously enforce c(x k ) = 0 for all geometries x k visited during the course of the optimization trajectory. This is important for molecular dynamics simulations, where conservation of energy requires that all structures of the trajectory lay on the constraint manifold. In contrast, optimization trajectories do not need to conserve energy, and, therefore, only the final converged structure must lie on the constraint manifold. For this reason, we have chosen not to use RATTLE or SHAKE for constrained optimization in our framework. Instead, our algorithm performs constrained optimization using null-space SQP, a method of Lagrange multipliers in which a linear step towards the constraint manifold is made at every iteration of the optimization. Using this approach, intermediate steps of optimization may not rigorously satisfy the constraint, though the constraint will be satisfied at convergence. In principle, our algorithm is capable of enforcing any function of the molecular structure as a constraint on the optimization. Sella natively supports the fixing of arbitrary atomic distances, bending angles, dihedral angles, and one or more Cartesian components of the barycenter of a cluster of atoms. When applied to a single atom, this last constraint fixes the atom in space. Recently, Sella has also implemented the ability to define custom constraint expressions, as well as the ability to enforce inequality constraints.Algorithm 2 Optimization algorithm 1: \nQuestion:\n Why did the authors choose not to use RATTLE or SHAKE for constrained optimization in their framework?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The authors chose not to use RATTLE or SHAKE because these algorithms enforce constraints at every step of the optimization, which is not necessary for optimization trajectories where only the final converged structure must lie on the constraint manifold.

This model is able to capture the behavior of TIPS-Tn reasonably well. The triplet formation kinetics are reproduced well, and the singlet decay has some small discrepancies, which, as with TIPS-Pn, we attribute to solvent reorganization or the presence of some additional S 1 deactivation pathways.

In this case, the average production cost for an optimized production and distribution network is between 1,000 USD/t N H 3 with a low capital cost scenario and 1,800 USD/t N H 3 with a high capital cost scenario (Figure ), the average transportation cost is between 90 USD/t N H 3 with a low capital cost scenario and 230 USD/t N H 3 with a high capital cost scenario (Figure ), and average transportation distance is between 1,000 km with a low capital cost scenario and 2,500 km with a high capital cost scenario (Figure ).

The magnitude of this increase in the experimental data over 8 ns is about 2.3% of the GSB magnitude, which is approximately equivalent to 0.041 mOD. An upper bound of 0.049 mOD T 1 absorption is therefore a reasonable estimate.For TIPS-Tn, SF begins to produce the same amount of triplet excitons as the upper limit of ISC at a concentration of 2.1 mM. At 8 mM, this rate of ISC would account for 22% of triplets formed by 8 ns. So as with TIPS-Pn, the assumption of negligible ISC when fitting the bimolecular SF rate constant is potentially invalid. Refitting the deconvoluted concentrations of the 8 mM TA with an ISC rate constant of 8.50 \u00d7 10 6 s -1 , gives a bimolecular SF rate constant of (2.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 9 M -1 s -1 (supplementary material Sec. S4. 3.3, Fig. 6(d)). Using this adjusted rate at 0.05 mM results in 2.7\u00d710 -10 M of triplets formed due to SF, which is still substantially lower than the limit of detection, so an upper bound of 118 ns for ISC is still valid. As with TIPS-Pn, the 8 mM TIPS-Tn S 1 population decays faster and fits slightly better than without ISC. Given that 8.50 \u00d7 10 6 s -1 is an upper bound on the ISC rate constant, the range of bimolecular SF rate constants can now be considered to be between 1.4 \u00d7 10 9 M -1 s -1 (lower bound of T 1 concentration, upper bound of ISC) to 3.2\u00d710 9 M -1 s -1 (upper bound of T 1 concentration, no ISC), or (2.3\u00b10.9)\u00d710 9 M -1 s -1 .We again note that, as for TIPS-Pn, the adjusted value of the SF rate constant does not affect the previously determined upper bound for the ISC rate constant.

We break this ideal situation by allowing the electronic transition dipole between the two electronic states to depend on the nuclear displacement. Physically this is a common situation because the ground and more often the excited states change their electronic configuration as the bond displacement is changing. This results in a stronger correlation between the electronic and nuclear dynamics because, on a fast time scale, the motion of the nuclear wave packets modulates the strength of the electronic coupling.

However, approximately 175 million metric tons of ammonia are produced yearly in fewer than 100 locations around the world. This results in transportation distances of thousands of kilometers in some instances. A consequence of centralized fertilizer manufacturing is that transportation costs can contribute more than 30% of the total fertilizer cost in certain regions. The cost of ammonia-based urea can range from as low as 250 USD/t in the United States to as high as 1,060 USD/t in Mozambique. This cost divergence often contributes to the underuse of synthetic ammonia-based fertilizers in many regions with growing populations, raising concerns for equitable development. Haber-Bosch facilities are also highly dependent on fossil fuels and produce 1.2% of global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions and consume 2% of global energy. Reliance on fossil fuels contributes to unstable ammonia prices. Between 2020 and 2023, the average global cost of ammonia fluctuated between 400 USD/t N H3 and 1,600 USD/t N H3 , largely due to the volatility of \nQuestion:\n Why do transportation costs contribute more than 30% of the total fertilizer cost in certain regions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Transportation costs contribute more than 30% of the total fertilizer cost in certain regions because approximately 175 million metric tons of ammonia are produced yearly in fewer than 100 locations around the world, resulting in transportation distances of thousands of kilometers in some instances.", "weight": 1}]}

Generating sequence orthogonal tyrosinases could enable the facile creation of complex multi-domain proteins by coupling anionic and cationic tagged subunits sequentially. This could be done in a manner similar to peptide synthesis but using entire proteins as building blocks. The controlled production of multi-protein polymers could be an enabling technology for protein based materials, biomedical technologies, and enzyme engineering. Although the megaTYR mutants to date were not fully prevented from acting on cationic substrates, the range in selectivity between abTYR and D55R megaTYR proved a tantalizing target. To test this, the cysteine-containing Y200C sfGFP was modified with EEEEY and RRRRY C-terminal tags, which should be unreactive with abTYR, and D55R megaTYR, respectively (Figure , S4). After purification, the Y200C sfGFP-EEEEY (GFP-E4Y) was exposed to abTYR for 30 min in a variety of conditions. Notably, the mushroom tyrosinase was able to append GGGGY and RRRRY peptides to the GFP-E4Y without oxidizing the EEEEY tag. In addition, exposing the GFP-E4Y to abTYR resulted in no discernable oxidation by ESI-MS. This aligns with our previous peptide screens, and suggests that the EEEEY tag is not succeptible to abTYR activation (Figure ). Similarly, Y200C sfGFP-RRRRY (GFP-R4Y) was exposed to D55R megaTYR under similar conditions, with the EEEEY peptide used in place of the RRRRY peptide. Similarly to abTYR, D55R megaTYR was able to selectively oxidize the added peptides without modifying the tyrosine tag on the GFP-R4Y. Reaction selectivity was further confirmed when exposure of GFP-R4Y to D55R megaTYR alone did not result in any oxidation (Figure ).

We reasoned that this was likely the high degree of negative charge on the nucleotide substrate.We next examined the substrate preference of the new tyrosinases, specifically with respect to their charge and steric tolerance. A peptide library with tyrosine residues at their C-termini was obtained, shown in Supplemental Table , which contained a variety of charged and neutral sequence elements. The peptides were coupled to Y200C GFP in 30 min reactions and analyzed via ESI-TOF MS to determine conversion to the modified peptide-protein conjugate. To ensure that peptide coupling was not biased by electrostatic interactions between GFP (pI = 6.2) and the peptides, control reactions were run on a p-aminophenylalanine modified MS2 capsid, which has a pI of 8.0. These reactions reached similar levels of modification (Supplemental Figure ). Comparing abTYR to the non-eukaryotic tyrosinases, it is readily apparent that abTYR is significantly more sensitive to negative charge (Figure ). In fact, abTYR shows no activity towards any peptide with 4 or more acidic residues adjacent to the terminal tyrosine. Also of note is the fact that megaTYR shows high activity towards all peptide substrates, with a drop in activity only in the case of the RRRRY peptide. These results supported the earlier challenge activating ssDNA substrates using abTYR, and suggest that megaTYR may serve as a highly permissive tyrosine activator.One additional observation of this study was that cnkTyr samples showed no discernable pattern of substrate specificity.

We expect such amphiphilic nature to enable strong electrostatic interactions between our Cu-HHTP films and PFAS owing to both i) the residual negative charge along the coordination sites and, ii) the hydrophilic nature of the MOF from the oxygen-rich ligand. In addition, the unique chemical structure of PFAS distinguishes them from other common water contaminants (e.g. inorganic salts) allowing the selectivity towards these larger and highly polar analytes easier to engineer. We thus tested the sensitivity of our Cu-HHTP films towards PFAS with the rationale that the electronic cloud present at each coordination nodes within the MOF would lead to strong electrostatic attractions between the MOF films and PFAS. Upon adsorption of a PFA, we expect electrostatic interactions between our electron-rich MOF and the fluorinated tail to alter the overall oxidation of Cu-HHTP. The change in film conductivity would be used for detection. This sensing mechanism was also inspired by the recent success of MOFs ( e.g. NU-1000, Cr-MIL-101) towards adsorbing PFAS in water. We aimed to enhance such adsorptive sensitivity by exposing more active metal sites on the surface of our MOF films, as opposed to the previously reported adsorb-to-capture approach in powder-based platforms. Since we expect that other oxidative pollutants might have a similar effect on the MOF, thus making selectivity a challenging task especially in ground water samples, we targeted to test the presence of PFAS in drinking water for proof of concept.

CEs of systematically increasing quality are generated by a modified metadynamics search algorithm and extrapolated to completeness. Variations of the rovibrational entropy over the CE are accounted for by a Boltzmann population average for the first time consistently.

Excellent performance is observed with mean deviations <1 cal mol -1 K -1 (about <1-2%) for the total molecular entropy.

Actually it is well known that formic acid protons -and more in general proton transfer events -can be strongly influenced by quantum effects, in particular by zero point energies (zpe). To gather insight on such issue, we have optimized the structure of the activated complex at the PBE level (see SI for details).The harmonic frequency involving the \"shared\" proton resulted 1676 cm -1 (with an O s -O f distance of 2.395 \u00c5), not surprisingly much lower than the wavenumbers obtained for the double well potential protonshuttling mechanism. By adding to the energy of the three optimized configurations the zpe, the barrier disappears, (see Figure ) indicating that the quantum approach predicts a shared-proton in a single-well at 0 K. Yet the energy differences still remain below the 1 kcal/mol, even upon inclusion of the zpe contribution. This result indicates that, in order to have a clear-cut answer to the question as to whether the molecule-to-surface proton transfer is governed by a single-well or a double-well potential, one should rest on electronic-structure calculations assuring at least 0.1 kcal/mol accuracy.

The interaction potential at different O-O' (in HOO') bond distances and HOO' bond angles are plotted in Figures and, respectively. As seen, the depth of the well is not increased with the increase of the bond distance or angle, even slightly decreased. Hence, exciting the two modes has no significant enhancement effects on the reactivity of R1b.Note that, the QCT approach can't consider the quantum effects, such as tunneling, zero-point energy conservation, and resonances. However, our previous quantum dynamics (QD) calculations yielded similar kinetics and dynamics results to the QCT calculated ones for a similar radicalradical reaction OH + HO2 \u2192 H2O + O2.

Two isostructural lanthanide based-metal-organic frameworks are used including a recognition center (aminogroup) that provides high selectivity for NO2 molecules. Energy transfer from the organic ligands to Ln is strongly dependent on the presence of NO2, resulting in an unprecedented photoluminescent sensing scheme.

However, these well-known microporous materials could see restricted their applications in heterogeneous catalysis if large reactants exceed their pore sizes leading to unavailable surface areas. In this work, we studied the effect of acetic acid concentration, used as the modulator, on the formation of micro/mesoporous materials. This inclusion of a modulator during synthesis and its removal by activation process generate materials with missing linker defects. We showed that an increase in the concentration of modulator leads to an improvement of calculated apparent surface area and a modification of MOF-808 pore structure by producing mesopores at the expense of micropores. Furthermore, we performed a post-synthetic modification of the MOF-808. We observed the expected sulfation of the zirconium oxo-cluster but also the sulfonation of the organic ligand. Also, we found that only the families of mesopores and the larger micropores are interconnected within the material, and the ultramicropores seems to be isolated from the porous structure. The PSM process led to the addition of Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acid sites to the MOF-808.

The arene fragment interacts with the Ni-Ni core via both a s-bond and a h 2 -interaction, with a bridging pivalate between the two Ni centers. Given that NBO analysis of I showed a symmetrical distribution of charge at the Ni-Ni core, we wondered whether a dynamic motion between the Ni-Ni core might enable a formal translocation of the Ni center at a proximal C(sp 2 ) site by forming a new s-bond and a h 2 -interaction with the arene backbone. If successful, such a process might constitute a formal metal translocation over the arene backbone, thus setting the basis for establishing a new rationale for enabling Ni-catalyzed C(sp 2 )-H functionalization of C-O electrophiles via \"ring-walking\" in the absence of directing groups or metalation events. Prompted by our interest in Ni-catalyzed C-H functionalization, we report herein the successful realization of this goal.

MOFs contain voids accessible for various probe molecules that can be used for many applications. Due to this modular design, there are almost no limits regarding structural nodes combination, resulting in a wide variety of frameworks with different topologies. In addition to excellent tunability of the material properties, MOFs often show immense surface areas with permanent porosity. A limited number of MOFs show also structural flexibility, reflected in a distinct structural response to external stimuli which can be considered among the most unique and fascinating properties compared to traditional porous solids. The phenomenon was first predicted in 1998 as an attribute of the third generation of MOFs, which are also known as flexible MOFs or soft porous crystals.

To compute the S 1 state (at 1 \u00c5 bondlength), we need to prepare the superposition of two singly excited configurations (excitation from \u03c3 to \u03c3 * with respect to the reference vacuum state |11000000\u27e9) with the equal weights as an initial guess vector |b 1 \u27e9.

The observed emission colors were distinguishable on the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram, yellow for JUC-557 and green for JUC-557-nanosheet (Fig. ). As shown in Supplementary Table , the fluorescence absolute quantum yield of bulk JUC-557 in solid state was only 9.0%, which can be attributed to the contribution of PE groups as AIE chromophores. However, compared with its bulk counterpart, JUC-557-nanosheet in solid state showed a 2-fold increase of fluorescence absolute quantum yield (~ 21.5%, Supplementary Table ), which is better than those of COF materials composed of only ACQ fluorophores. This is because of an enhanced emission by weakening the luminescence quenching of carbazole knots and no significant change of the fluorescence of PE groups. Furthermore, JUC-557nanosheet dispersed in ethanol showed a more improved absolute quantum yield (up to 23.0%) because the nanosheets can be well scattered in solution, leading to further fluorescence enhancement (Supplementary Table ).

Consequently, although QPE is an important milestone in quantum computing for quantum simulations, it is not practical for realistic applications . To address this limitation, a more NISQ-friendly algorithm with low circuit depths, called a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), was proposed . The VQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on variational principle. The algorithm entails preparing a parameterized quantum state on the quantum device and measuring the expectation value of the Hamiltonian on the trial state. The classical optimization procedure iteratively adjusts the parameters of the trial state to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. By leveraging classical optimization techniques with quantum measurements, VQE requires significantly smaller quantum resources compared to QPE.

In particular, three heavy industries, i.e. chemicals (production of primary chemicals i.e., ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, ammonia, and methanol), steel, and cement, account for nearly 60% of all energy consumption and about 72% of all the industrial CO2 emissions. Electrifying industry has been a viable option for years, but it has two challenges. Firstly, the cost of electricity per unit energy (MWh) is higher than fossil fuels, making it less appealing for businesses. Secondly, industrialized countries such as Germany, Poland, the US, and the Netherlands produce electricity with high carbon intensity (>300 g CO2/kWh) , making electrification ineffective in reducing industry's carbon footprint.In densely populated countries like the Netherlands, the electricity grid is near its maximum transport capacity, causing congestion problems. Large off-takers and electricity producers joining the network without a planned expansion worsen the situation. Hence, hydrogen is seen as a potential substitute for electrification. In industry, there are two primary methods for utilizing hydrogen. The first is to generate heat, primarily high-temperature heat. The second is to use it as a chemical reagent in processes such as the Haber-Bosch process for obtaining ammonia.If heat is the main input needed by a particular industry, then in principle hydrogen can directly substitute fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal.

Understanding the processes that occur at each electrode and their relationship with the current density is critical to further improvements in energy efficiency.To achieve the necessary insights, suitable interrogation and measurement techniques are needed to detect what occurs on each electrode surface. High-speed video cameras have commonly been used as a non-invasive tool to monitor gas evolution on electrode surfaces. However, it is extremely difficult, if not physically impossible, to observe bubble generation in a zero-gap cell using a high-speed camera, even in the form of a boroscope. Therefore, it is necessary to develop other techniques that could be applied to the detection and characterization of bubble formation in water electrolysers.Acoustic emission has been demonstrated as a cost-effective, non-destructive testing technique that can detect and monitor transition elastic waves produced under the stress of material deformation. It is generally deployed in structural testing, process monitoring and materials characterisation. This technique has been applied to the detection of bubble formation in PEMWE by monitoring and analyzing sound waves generated when bubbles form and burst.

These Buchwald-type ligands with flanking mesityl groups have been shown to possess attractive interactions between the gold center and one of the flanking mesityl groups, as was ascertained by determination of the molecular structures of a series of gold complexes 2, 3, 4 and 5.The percent buried volume of 1b amounts to ca. 55% and a linear fit of known TEP-values with their respective gas phase structures (obtained by DFT studies) revealed that particularly 1b can be classified as electron-rich phosphine and their application in the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes was tested. Preparing catalyst solutions by chloride ion abstraction from 2 with AgX salts, sometimes the formation of the respective dimeric Ag-complexes [(L)Ag-\u00b5-Cl]2 6a and 6b was noted, which were independently synthesized. This is another example that AgCl contamination can result in erroneous catalyst screening results. Screening of the catalytic reaction conditions showed efficient hydroamination to take place at 60\u00b0C in MeCN with a catalyst loading of 4 of 1 mol% and moderate to excellent yields were achieved for bulky anilines such as Dip-NH2 and different phenyl acetylene derivatives. No obvious difference in performance between ligands 1a and 1b was noted. In summary, terphenylbisaminophosphines meet the criteria of efficient ligands for intermolecular gold-catalyzed hydroamination reactions, as they combine strong donor properties with the 2-biphenyl structural motif, which is needed to enhance complex stability during catalysis. \nQuestion:\n At what temperature did the efficient hydroamination take place?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: 60\u00b0C", "weight": 1}]}

We must consider the spatial distribution of water stress to create ammonia production infrastructure that is not affected by changes in seasonal water availability. To do this, we modified the optimization equation (equation S46) by adding a weight (w 1 ) to the ammonia production cost and a weight (w 2 ) to the water stress at the possible production locations. By changing the value of w 1 and w 2 , we can vary the relative importance placed on the ammonia cost and water stress.As the importance placed on water stress increases, the average water stress decreases dramatically (Figure ). The same increase in the importance placed on water stress leads to a marginal increase in ammonia production and distribution costs. For example, a scenario that prioritizes cost over water (Figure -red line) results in an average ammonia production cost of 805 USD/t N H 3 , a distribution cost of 85 USD/t N H 3 , and a water stress of 6.8 (indicating that the water usage in the region is 6.8 times larger than The production and distribution networks were optimized assuming an ammonia transportation cost of 0.09 USD/t N H 3 -km for the medium cost scenario and 40% energy efficiency.

Optimal results were achieved with a catalyst concentration of 300 mg/L, as higher dosages led to reduced efficiency due to particle agglomeration and decreased light access to active sites.Higher initial dye concentrations also resulted in reduced removal rates due to increased competition for reactive radicals.

The spatial separation of the excited electron from its orbital of origin (the hole left behind upon excitation) suggests a small electron-hole binding energy in azupyrene. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that electron and hole, i.e., positive and negative charge carriers, can more easily be separated in azupyrene-based than in pyrene-based organic electronics devices.For illustration, the frontier orbitals of azupyrene are shown in Figure : the HOMO is partly localized at the tip-atoms of the 7-membered rings and has vanishing coefficients at the neighboring atoms and the central C2-unit, whereas the LUMO+1 shows a reversed localization with a nodal plane running through the tip atoms of the 7-membered ring (see Figure , left). In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO of pyrene are linked by the Coulson-Rushbrooke pairing theorem and thus are localized on the same carbon atoms (see Figure , right). Thus, the lower band gap of azupyrene is caused by its nonalternant nature in two ways: (i) the \"frozen orbital\" electronic band gap is smaller, because the HOMO is higher in energy and the LUMO is lower in energy and (ii) the reduced electron-electron repulsion in the excited state leads to an even smaller optical band gap.The fact that the HOMO\u2192LUMO transition is forbidden for azupyrene has further consequences for its fluorescence spectrum. Indeed, no substantial fluorescence could be detected for azupyrene (see Figure of the SI). Adhering to Kasha's rule, the azupyrene molecule would relax non-radiatively to the lowest excited singlet state S1, where one electron resides in the former LUMO.

Unlike ordered and stoichiometric compounds, alloys represent a continuous compositional space. Isostructural alloys -solid solutions of two or more materials with the same underlying crystal structure -are the most common types of functional alloys. Iso-structural alloys as electronic materials have applications in photovoltaics (e.g., II-VI materials such as CdSe x Te 1-x and III-V-based multijunction technologies ), energy storage (e.g., Li 6 PS 5-x Se x (Cl,I), Li 3 Y 1-x In x Cl 3 ), and thermoelectrics (e.g., PbSe x Te 1-x 9 ), etc. Heterostructural alloys, in contrast, form between materials with different structures, such as alloys between wurtzite AlN and rocksalt ScN, wurtzite ZnO and rocksalt MnO, and orthorhombic SnS and rocksalt CaS. Beyond their functional properties, they also exhibit interesting thermodynamics of mixing not observed in their isostructural counterparts. Due to their exceptional optoelectronic, charge transport, and electromechanical properties, a large class of polar wurtzite AlN-based alloys is already enabling light emitting diodes (isostructural Al 1-x Ga x N ) and electromechanical resonators \nQuestion:\n What are the most common types of functional alloys?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Isostructural alloys", "weight": 1}]}

As predicted by mechanical considerations of the H4FBCDC ligand, the metal-organic framework DUT-140(Cu) shows intrinsic flexibility as well as negative gas adsorption property with an \u0394nNGA = 5.45 mmol/g. The contraction of the opphase can be induced by adsorption of hydrocarbons like methane or butane as well as carbon dioxide. Adsorption experiments also confirm the assumption that the use of the H4FBCDC linker leads to a more rigid network since the adsorption of nitrogen does not trigger the phase transformation.UV/Vis investigations of DUT-140(Cu) showed a distinct change in the absorption spectrum which could be attributed to an excitation from the carbazole moiety to the fluorenone part by DFT calculations. Since this excitation is highly affected by the deformation of the linker, it can be concluded that the fluorescence spectrum also should change under the given conditions due to the structural transformation.The fluorescence properties of the fluorescent linker could be unveiled by an exchange of the metal node to a zinc paddlewheel. However, the stiffening of the metal-organic framework did not lead to the desired increased resistance to desolvation stress for DUT-140(Zn), indicating the metal node to be the main limiting factor, leading to amorphization during desolvation in such highly porous framework materials, even under mild supercritical conditions.In situ fluorescence studies provide clear evidence that a fluorescence change is caused by structural decomposition of the metal-organic framework and revealed the importance of the fine interplay of linker rigidity and metal node stability for the investigation of structural contraction by solvent desorption.Overall, fluorenone moieties are valuable functional building blocks for the detection of structural \nQuestion:\n What happens to the fluorescence properties of the linker when the metal node is exchanged to a zinc paddlewheel?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The fluorescence properties of the linker could be unveiled by an exchange of the metal node to a zinc paddlewheel.", "weight": 1}]}

The goal here is to:(1) assess whether M -rich heterostructural Al 1-x M x N alloys can be (meta)stabilized using similar non-equilibrium thin-film growth used for Al 1-x Gd x N, and (2) derive trends across the series of Al 1-x M x N alloys and formulate design principles. Figure shows the calculated formation thermodynamics of Al 1-x Tb x N and Al 1-x Pr x N alloys. For consistency, the same DFT methodology as used for Al 1-x Gd x N alloy calculations is adopted for the Tb and Pr analogues. Here, Tb is chosen because of its similar ionic size and electronegativity to Gd and Pr because it lies in the lanthanoid series between La (no f electrons) and Gd.The critical compositions (x c ) for wurtzite\u2192rocksalt phase transition in the three Al 1-x M x N alloy systems studied here are 0.82 (M = Gd), 0.84 (M = Tb), and 0.87 (M = Pr).

We observe a non-monotonic change in x c as we move down group 3 and across the lanthanide series, with x c first increasing from Sc \u2192 La and then decreasing through to Yb. The trend is counter-intuitive if one considers only the changes in the ionic size. The M 3+ cation sizes in octahedral coordination, which is the native coordination in the ground-state M N rocksalt phase, are tabulated in Table .

In addition to breathing and swelling phenomena of flexible MOFs, negative gas adsorption (NGA) and pressure amplification (PA) is one of the more recent discoveries in this field, initially observed in the cubic DUT-49 framework. In recent years the structural contraction was monitored by physisorption, X-ray diffraction, NMR and EPR techniques, providing only limited information about the electronic structure of the ligand. In this work we designed a new ligand with a fluorescent core in the linker backbone and synthesized three new MOFs, isoreticular to DUT-49, denoted as DUT-140(M) (M -Cu, Co, Zn) crystalizing in space group Fm 3 m . DUT-140(Cu) can be desolvated and is highly porous with an accessible apparent surface area of 4870 m 2 g -1 and a pore volume of 2.59 cm 3 g -1 . Furthermore, it shows flexibility and NGA upon adsorption of subcritical gases. DUT-140(Zn), synthesized using post-synthetic metal exchange, could only be studied with guests in the pores.

Obviously, like for other techniques based on empirical scores, the predictiveness of the method cannot be limited to the best solution only and those secondary metal binding sites that BioMetAll detects are not necessarily false positives but transient metallic environments accessible to the protein (see our first application case on HSA). Energetic terms and other physico-chemical magnitudes that are not present in BioMetAll, could dictate the fine structure of the metal-binding site. Posterior filtering could be necessary depending on the objective of its use.The accuracy of the predicted binding area was further assessed by measuring the distance from the experimental metal position to the nearest computed probe. On average a difference between calculated and experimental positions of the metal is about 0.56 \u00b1 0.19 \u00c5. Importantly, such quality is not influenced by the presence of donors coordinated to the metal provided by exogenous compounds (e.g. phosphate or water molecules). In these cases, we generally observe a displacement to the limits of the predicted region (Figure ), suggesting that the exogenous donors only slightly modify the position of the metal and the organization of the side chains.Because calculations are performed in a blind manner, meaning that all the system is screened for predicting metal-binding sites, these results are quite remarkable. Regarding the computational cost of the calculations, they range from 3s to 245s, with a median of 18s (with the size of the system highly correlating with the computational time r=0.89, p<0.0001).The benchmark shows that BioMetAll is a suitable software to predict metal-binding sites.

All other terms carry their usual meanings. The vibrational energy (\u0127\uf077) is affected by the isotope effect and hence may give rise to KIE in ET rates. The model predicted both normal and inverse KIE depending upon the frequency shifts and the displaced potential energy surfaces of the reacting components.Realizing that some of the thiols (~ 30%) stay protonated in these SAMs and are likely strongly H-bonded to their neighbouring thiolates as indicated by a very weak -SH stretch at 2155 cm -1 relative to 2550 cm -1 in free thiols, the KIE observed here can originate from one of the many possible normal modes at the interface that may be displaced during ET. In particular, very large (>200 cm -1 ) normal H/D isotope effects were observed for C-S-H bending modes and large inverse (10-30 cm -1 ) H/D isotope effects were observed on the C-S stretching modes (both Gauche and Trans). Observation of such strong coupling between these modes and very weak S-H vibration suggests that the thiols at the interface are likely strongly hydrogen bonded to the neighbouring thiolates. It is conceivable that these modes change during electron transfer. Of course, this requires the ET from the electrode to be localized at these Au-SAM units.

Subsequently, the reactor was exposed to a UVA light source for a predetermined duration of 120 minutes, while being subjected to constant stirring. The process of dye molecule removal was observed through the utilization of UV-Vis absorption spectra measurements of the solutions at predetermined time intervals.

Since the phosphorylation levels of MOM proteins are regulated by the balance between phosphorylation by PINK1 and dephosphorylation by DUBs (step (i) in Fig. ) , the observed acceleration of Parkin recruitment in Fig. is likely due to the increased phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Parkin by artificially recruiting cytPINK1 on the MOM. In other words, our photochromic CID technique can manipulate the phosphorylation levels of proteins on the MOM in a photoreversible manner and may eventually be applied to the regulation of other signaling pathways.We also recognize some drawbacks of this photochromic CID system. The intense excitation light for mEGFP (473 nm) and mOrange2 (555 nm) may cause photoisomerization of pcDH (Fig. , Supplementary Fig. ). However, this unfavorable isomerization could be overcome using intermittent illumination (Figs. ).

Thus, a one-pot synthesis procedure involving in situ formation of potassium salt K[Cu(CF3)4] by oxidation of CuCl in MeCN with oxygen in the presence of excess TMSCF3 and KF was developed (Scheme 3). The formed tetrakis(trifluoromethyl)cuprate was quantitatively converted into (MeCN)Cu(CF3)3 (1b) by the treatment with triflic acid. Complex 1b was isolated by aqueous acidic workup and extraction with dichloromethane. In contrast to relatively stable DMF complex 1a, compound 1b should be handled with care and stored in solution at -20 \u00b0C. A spontaneous decomposition with the evolution of gas took place upon complete removal of solvent or heating above room temperature. Crystallization at -20 \u00b0C afforded colorless Xray quality crystals of acetonitrile Cu(CF3)3 adduct 1b. Crystal structure (Figure ) showed square-planar geometry of the Cu(III) center with exceptionally short Cu-N distance of 1.906(8) \u00c5.

It is also shorter than Cu(II)-N distances in acetonitrile complexes. This can be attributed to a combination of highly electron-deficient Cu(III) center and sp-hybridization of the nitrogen atom. To the best of our knowledge, this is the shortest Cu-N bond found in the CSD database. Inspired with the success in isolation of Cu(CF3)3 solvates, we investigated the properties of elusive free Cu(CF3)3 molecule by theoretical calculations. First, optimization of the geometry showed that the free Cu(CF3)3 is T-shaped in the absence of any ligand, and the geometry of this fragment is preserved upon solvation (Figure \nQuestion:\n Is the Cu-N distance in the acetonitrile Cu(CF3)3 adduct shorter or longer than the Cu-C distances mentioned?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The Cu-N distance is shorter than the Cu-C distances.", "weight": 1}]}

Listing 1 contains a minimal Python script that uses Sella to perform saddle point optimization on a molecule in an internal coordinate basis. An initial geometry contained in input_structure.xyz is read using ASE's IO routines. An ASE calculator for NWChem is attached to the resulting ASE Atoms object using all default settings, which will perform a calculation at the HF/3-21G level of theory. This level of theory can be changed by adding arguments to the NWChem calculator object constructor, and the code used to perform the calculation can be altered by replacing the NWChem class with a different calculator for an alternative code. A Sella optimizer object is then created for the ASE Atoms object, with optimization in internal coordinates requested explicitly. Finally, the optimization to a saddle point is run with a convergence criteria of a maximum atomic force of 0.01 eV \u00c5 -1 .The optimization algorithm implemented in Sella has several user-tunable hyperparameters that may be passed to the Sella class. One important parameter is the iterative diagonalization convergence criterion \u03b3, which may be set with the keyword argument gamma. By default, \u03b3 = 0.1, though tighter convergence may be requested by reducing \u03b3. Reducing \u03b3 will result in additional iterative Hessian diagonalization steps, but will result in a more accurate approximate Hessian and therefore better subsequent geometry optimization steps.

However, the crossover between electrodes was shown to be minimal.Constant current steps (60 s) of increasingly high areal current density were conducted with 120 s rests between each value.

The results in Figure indicated that every time an acoustic event (a 'hit') was detected, it was above the chosen threshold value of 25 dB. The amplitude of each hit is indicated in each plot.For the cathode (Figure (a)) very few acoustic hits were observed at low current densities (e.g. Only two hits were observed across the 1 min, 10 mA cm -2 period), this is an indication of exceptionally low bubble formation with very limited acoustic activity. This trend for low amounts of bubble formation at low areal current densities continued across the first few current densities tested, although notably as the current density increased there was an increase in the number of hits occurring in each constant current step.

INTRODUCTIONMultireference wave function methods are important tools in the quantum chemist's arsenal, for the description of static correlation in systems with stretched bonds or other types of (near-) degeneracies, as well as open-shell systems including radicals and excited states. However, the exponential scaling of computational cost with respect to active space size, for methods such as the complete active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) theory, limits the size and scope of problems that can be addressed in this way. To reduce the cost of multireference approaches, alternative ans\u00e4tze have been developed, notably spin-flip (SF) methods. Amongst the SF family of approaches, one of the most important variants is the restricted active space (RAS-)SF method. Configuration interaction (CI) wave functions within the RAS family include all possible configurations within an active space, and (at a minimum) single excitations into and out of the active space. As such, RAS-SF provides a low-cost, balanced treatment of ground and excited states with multi-radical character. Unlike CASSCF, the RAS-SF technique does not require orbital optimization, which significantly reduces both complexity and cost.

We tested the method, named qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson and qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson/Variational, on four systems: H 2 /6-31G, H 4 /STO-3G, LiH/STO-3G, and H 2 O/STO-3G(FC) showing good agreements with the energies obtained from EOM-VQE .The Davidson implementation of the qEOM-UCCSD algorithm provides the advantage over the qEOM and EOM-VQE by reducing the working Hilbert space significantly. The classic Davidson method iteratively interacts with the outcome from the quantum devices and provides feedback to grow the ansatz (vector space) to prepare desired quantum states.The implementation provides several advantages compared to the currently available excitedstate methods in quantum computing. First, qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson significantly reduces the computational demand for classical diagonalization step, because the dimension of the resulting subspace Hamiltonian only spanned by a few guess vectors. In the case of its variational variant, the Davidson algorithm provides the certain electronic configurations that are expected to contribute to the target excited states. Therefore, it introduces a significantly smaller number of variational parameters resulting in a significantly reduced searching space.In addition, similarly to the classical variant, the presented Davidson algorithm produces the excited state of the desired spatial or spin symmetry (in the case of the closed-shell references). The qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson can target the specific group of transitions by defining suitable subspace vectors and can be extended to target higher-energy states or specific transitions .

Two synthetic routes towards terphenyl-substituted bisaminophoshines 1a (R = Me) and 1b (R = Et).Ragogna and co-workers have recently described a route towards Ter-PCl2 through aminolysis of Ter-P(NEt2)2 with dry HCl. Consequently, we prepared Ter-P(NR2)2 [R = Me (1a), Et (1b)] by treatment of isolated Ter-Li with ClP(NR2)2 (R = Me, Et; an HClfree P-source) in toluene at ambient temperature (Scheme 1, reaction 1). In case of 1a, filtration over a celite-padded frit and removal of the solvent resulted in the isolation of an analytically pure colourless so lid in 67% yield. For 1b, after stirring for 1.5 h, the solvent was removed and the residue was extracted with n-hexane, concentrated to incipient crystallization and standing at 5 \u00b0C overnight afforded 1b as an analytically pure colourless crystalline solid, in a moderate yield of 40%. We found that consistently higher yields are obtained by starting from Ter-I. Lithiation of Ter-I with 2.5 M n BuLi (in n-hexane) in Et2O at 0\u00b0C and subsequent treatment with ClP(NR2)2 afforded 1a (79 %) and 1b (89 %) in good isolated yields (Scheme 1, reaction 2). In addition, this synthetic approach can be easily scaled and 1b was prepared on a multigram scale. Ligands 1a and 1b are characterized by 31 P NMR signals at 102.5 and 100.2 ppm, respectively, upfield-shifted compared to their respective ClP(NR2)2 precursors. In the 1 H NMR spectrum of 1a and 1b two signals for the ortho and para CH3-groups of the mesityl groups in a 2:1 ratio are observed. In 1a a doublet corresponding to the two NMe2 groups is detected, indicating C2 symmetry in solution. In 1b a complex multiplet is observed for the methylene protons in the Et-groups of the NEt2-moiety, and a triplet for the Me-groups. X-ray quality crystals of both 1a and 1b were grown from saturated n-hexane \nQuestion:\n What is the step before subsequent treatment with ClP(NR2)2 in the synthesis of terphenyl-substituted bisaminophoshines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Lithiation of Ter-I with 2.5 M n BuLi in Et2O at 0\u00b0C", "weight": 1}]}

Moreover, the TRPL spectra of JUC-557-nanosheet were studied, and it showed a slight change after adding different amounts of I 2 with \u03c4 0 /\u03c4 \u22481 (from 6.48-6.25 ns, Fig. ), indicating a static nature of the fluorescence quenching. The obvious change of UV-vis absorption band of JUC-557-nanosheet caused by the addition of I 2 was observed, indicating the formation of a nonemissive complex (Supplementary Fig. ). Meanwhile, the absorption band of I 2 in water was obviously overlapped with the excitation band of JUC-557-nanosheet, leading to a fluorescence quenching from resonance energy transfer of nanosheet with I 2 (Supplementary Fig. ). Like the detection of Fe 3+ , the synergistic mechanism of static quenching and energy transfer quenching renders an outstanding fluorescence sensing of JUC-557-nanosheet for I 2 .Also, we proved the unique iodine recognition ability of the nanosheet in the seawater (from the Bohai Sea, China). As shown in Supplementary Fig. , the seawater with the trace iodine caused an apparent fluorescence quenching of the nanosheet. The K a value of JUC-557-nanosheet with I 2 in seawater was estimated to be 1.27 \u00d7 10 5 M -1 , which is slightly lower than that from pure I 2 because organics in seawater could partially react with iodine. Furthermore, I 2 vapor can be quickly detected based on the fluorescence quenching of JUC-557-nanosheet, and the quenching percentage was almost up to 90% within only 30 s (Fig. ). These results demonstrated that JUC-557-nanosheet had a promising practical application for the detection of harmful I 2 as a sensitive sensor. \nQuestion:\n What are the benefits and drawbacks of using JUC-557-nanosheet for iodine detection?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Benefits include excellent cycling stability, outstanding fluorescence sensing for iodine, unique iodine recognition ability in seawater, and rapid detection of iodine vapor with high quenching percentage.

To reduce overhead, the constructed pipelines are designed to function exactly as any single method, i.e., they are fully compatible with the rest of the modules and data structures in the package. Furthermore, pipelines can be easily saved, reused and shared to foster the development of a repository of preprocessing protocols. As a seed to this repository, RamanSPy provides a library of assembled preprocessing protocols (custom pre-defined, or adapted from the literature ), which users can access and exploit.To illustrate the pipelining functionalities, we use RamanSPy to construct three preprocessing protocols by compiling selected methods in the desired order of execution, and applying them out-of-the-box to data loaded into the platform (Fig. ). We use them to preprocess Raman spectroscopic data from (Fig. ). Note how the three pipelines yield substantially different results, reinforcing the importance of consistency in the selection of preprocessing protocols. Pipeline II was deemed the most robust, and consequently added to the protocols library in RamanSPy as default.RamanSPy facilitates AI integration and validation of nextgeneration Raman data analytics. To help accelerate the adoption of AI technologies for RS analysis, RamanSPy is endowed with a permeable architecture, which streamlines the interface between Raman spectroscopic data and the burgeoning ML ecosystem in Python. This is complemented by tools for benchmarking, such as datasets and performance metrics, which support the evaluation of new models and algorithms. We show below two examples of RamanSPy's capabilities for ML integration and benchmarking.First, RamanSPy allows the seamless integration of standard Python AI/ML methods (e.g., from scikit-learn , \nQuestion:\n What is the step before applying them out-of-the-box to data loaded into the platform in constructing preprocessing protocols using RamanSPy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Compiling selected methods in the desired order of execution", "weight": 1}]}

The anhydrous samples here should have little oxygen present, which is consistent with the 18 ns lifetime measured for TIPS-Pn here being towards the higher end of the previously reported lifetimes.The 8 mM TIPS-Pn TA spectra (Fig. )) show predominantly the same spectral features as the dilute sample, but with the addition of a peak at 504 nm that forms over the 8 ns window.The singlet features decrease in amplitude concurrent with the formation of this peak, as shown in Fig. 1(d). This additional peak is consistent with the ESA of a TIPS-Pn triplet exciton. ISC is a unimolecular process, and so it should cause the same amount of triplet formation at 0.05 mM as at 8 mM. Given negligible triplet formation was observed at 0.05 mM, the triplet formation observed at 8 mM must be due to SF. TA gives no indication of spin coherence, and so potentially the 504 nm peak could be assigned to the 1 (T...T) state. However, since this state behaves spectroscopically the same as free triplets, for simplicity we refer to it as the T 1 state.The TA spectra of dilute and concentrated TIPS-Tn exhibit differences that are similar to those in TIPS-Pn.

This is apparent in the intense yellow color displayed by solutions of azupyrene, whereas solutions of pyrene are colorless (See insets in Figure ). In agreement with the yellow color of azupyrene, the UV/Vis spectrum (Figure ) shows an absorption peak for azupyrene at a photon energy of 2.6 eV, in the blue part of the visible range. Pyrene has its lowest energy peak at a much higher photon energy of 3.7 eV, well outside the visible range. The resulting optical excitation energies, determined from the rising edge of the peak, are 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding a difference of 1.09 eV. Our ab initio calculations within the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) approach (see vertical lines in Figure ) overestimate the absolute excitation energies for both molecules. However, the calculations yield a difference in transition energies of 1.10 eV between azupyrene and pyrene, in excellent agreement with the experiment. It should be noted that while the lowest energy excitation corresponds to the transition from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO\u2192LUMO) in pyrene, this transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and the peak in the visible range has to be attributed to the transition into a higher lying unoccupied orbital (HOMO\u2192LUMO+1).

This is observed for C 18 H 38 and S conf calculated at the GFN-FF level and would always be the case if S msRRHO (see Eq. 11) is calculated at the same level as S msRRHO . For C 16 H 34 variations between the different theory levels are larger and only the GFN2 conformational entropy for the folded conformer as reference is still within chemical accuracy. Nevertheless, accurate entropies of extremely flexible large alkanes have been consistenly obtained for the first time and this can be considered as a major achievement even though some issues for C 18 H 38 remain. The detailed reasons for the deviations for the \"worst cases\" C 16 H 34 and particularly C 18 H 38 are not fully clear at this point but originate tentatively from the S conf part.Technical size limitations of our approach should also be noted. The computational cost increases strongly with molecule size at high flexibility and can make the conformational entropy calculation unfeasible for larger molecules. At the GFN2 level, the S conf calculation for C 16 H 34 already takes a few hundred hours of computation time, and hence, we did not attempt to calculate C 18 H 38 at this level of theory. With the much cheaper GFN-FF method, on the other hand, the entropy for both C 16 H 34 and C 18 H 38 can still be computed roughly \"over night\" on a standard CPU node with 14 cores. Somewhat larger (up to 100-200 atoms) but less flexible molecules (e.g., typical drugs, see Sec.4.4) are also feasible at the GFN-FF level due to the shorter MD run times required.

Dvo\u0159\u00e1k et al. fit the SF rate constant for a range of TIPS-Pn concentrations in chloroform, and found the rate constant decreased linearly with concentration below 10 mM. The bimolecular rate constant from this linear trend was 4 \u00d7 10 9 M -1 s -1 . This value is somewhat larger than the (2.7 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 9 M -1 s -1 from our analysis here, which we attribute partly to the different rates of diffusion in chloroform and toluene. Toluene has a higher viscosity than chloroform (0.56 mPas compared with 0.52 mPas), so diffusion is expected to be slower. We can determine a theoretical rate of diffusion in these solvents from the Stokes-Einstein relation ask diffuse = 8RT 3\u03b7, where \u03b7 is the viscosity. For toluene the diffusion rate is 1.2\u00d710 10 M -1 s -1 , and for chloroform it is 1.3\u00d710 10 M -1 s -1 . This difference (10%) is smaller than the difference in SF rate constants of TIPS-Pn in the two solvents, but the Stokes-Einstein relation is a simplified representation of diffusion, and the trend is consistent. We note the two solvents also have different dielectric constants (2.38 for toluene compared to 4.81 for chloroform). It has been suggested that charge-transfer states may play a role in SF, which would be influenced by the dielectric constant, and may also be a contributing factor to SF.

The main key findings in this regard were: (i) all the synthesized materials displayed a certain degree of amorphicity related to the formation of a mesoporous structure. (ii) Increasing the concentration of the employed modulator promoted the formation of a more crystalline structure without affecting the thermal stability of the material. At the same time, the porous structure of the materials was also modified as a function of the concentration of the modulator. Particularly, wider and more numerous mesopores were formed at the highest acetic acid concentration without affecting the relative proportion between the two families of micropores belonging to the inner structure of the material. (iii) Evidence suggests that the activation stage of the materials synthesis encompasses the removal of adsorbed water and organic linkers replaced by molecules of the modulator was found. On the other hand, an analysis of the effects produced by performing a conventional post-synthetic modification with sulfuric acid of a selected sample from the synthesized defective Zr-MOFs led to conclude the following: (i) sulfuric acid chemically attack the surface structure of the defective Zr-MOF leading to a sulfation of the Zr moieties and to a sulfonation of the organic functional groups besides of depositing residual sulfate ions on the surface. (ii) The attack performed by sulfuric acid enhanced the thermal stability of the Zr-MOF, but it degraded its porous and crystalline structure. Concerning the former, the collected evidence for the PSM treated Zr-MOF suggested that only the families of mesopores and the larger micropores are interconnected within the material.

All six reactions led to the formation of nine expected products with a very similar ratio of products and close to equimolar representation (Fig. ). HPLC traces of the crossover reactions indicated that regardless of the initial combination of substrates, a good yield of all the combinatorial products with only a minimal amount of side-products is achieved. These experiments corroborated that the sulfinamide crossover is suitable for generation a new type of dynamic combinatorial libraries. It should be pointed out that sulfinamides are generally stable compounds in neutral and basic aqueous environment. Therefore, the resulting libraries are compatible with biochemical binding assays. The limited stability in acidic aqueous buffers and possible biological oxidation can be a limiting factor in more complex biological experiments. We hypothesized that freezing the libraries by oxidation to sulfonamides would provide stable compounds of relevance in medicinal chemistry. Therefore, we subjected the mini-library of nine sulfinamides to mild oxidation with mCPBA.Delightfully, the oxidation proceeded smoothly, providing an expected set of nine sulfonamides with minimum side-products (see SI).

This custom Raman-compatible substrate is based on a gold layer that blocks interfering signal from the underlying glass slide . This gold layer is coated with a thin SiO 2 layer that allows the covalent attachment of a PA gel without producing a substantial background signal . This renders the substrates suitable for the construction of the aforementioned microarray platform for screening HSC fate decisions and other types of stem cells with noninvasive Raman spectroscopy. To fabricate the substrates, thermal vapor deposition was used to deposit a 5-nm-thick chromium (Cr) adhesion layer on the glass substrate, followed a 50nm-thick gold (Au) layer. The thickness of each layer was monitored during deposition with a quartz crystal thickness monitor. These layer thicknesses were validated by using X-ray reflectivity, and good agreement was found (Figure ). Then a 100-nm-thick silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) layer was deposited on top of the gold layer using PECVD. Based on use of this fabrication process to create a single batch of substrates, we calculate our cost is $3.35 per substrate, which is approximately 8 times less expensive than the commercially available (Thorlabs) protected gold mirror substrate (Table ). Of course, the cost would further decrease for both academic and nonacademic users if multiple batches were fabricated at a time.

Though decane (32 atoms) is smaller than the drug molecule tamiflu (50 atoms), their conformational entropy values are rather similar. The simple explanation for this is the higher flexiblity of decane, which is typically indicated by a larger relative contribution of S conf to the absolute entropy for similar sized structures. In general S conf will be close to zero for the most rigid molecules or molecules with only a few distinct conformers, but adds a significant portion (ten or more percent) to the absolute entropy for highly flexible molecules.The last contributrion to S conf is the population average S msRRHO . This term may provide insight about the variation of S msRRHO within the ensemble. It will be small if all contributing conformers have a similar ro-vibrational entropy as the reference structure (e.g. for decane with 0.7 cal mol -1 K -1 ), or yields a large contribution in the opposite case (tamiflu, 2.3 cal mol -1 K -1 ). For the latter, computed msRRHO entropies can vary by several entropy units for different conformations rather independently of the chosen \u03c4 or \u03bd scal values. An example is provided in Fig. , where S msRRHO was calculated for 299 (random) conformers of tamiflu at two different theoretical levels (GFN-FF and B97-3c). Here, entropies at the GFN-FF level are overestimated by 4 cal mol -1 K -1 on average compared to the more accurate B97-3c level. Both methods show a similar spread of the S msRRHO values, which range approximately 6 cal mol -1 K -1 from lowest to highest value thus reassureing the use of S msRRHO . Hence, the validity of an approximate S msRRHO obtained at SQM or FF level depends on the performance for relative msRRHO entropies and may be used if a shifted (cf. Eq. 11) population average similar to the higher reference DFT level is expected. Another novelty of our approach is the extrapolation of S conf to the ensemble completeness as \nQuestion:\n What will be the size of the contribution to S msRRHO if all contributing conformers have a similar ro-vibrational entropy as the reference structure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The contribution to S msRRHO will be small.", "weight": 1}]}

In particular, the use of plasmonic nanoparticles in the field of heterogeneous catalysis for achieving enhanced reactivity at relatively milder operating conditions has gained significant attention. The key features driving these developments are, ability to tailor properties of plasmonic nanoparticles towards harnessing light energy to catalyze chemical reactions and obtaining chemical selectivity, otherwise not readily possible using conventional methods. An important question emerging from these studies is regarding the nature of energy transfer from electronically excited nanoparticles to the reactants, ultimately leading to product formation. Mukherjee and coworkers have reported enhanced rates of H 2 + D 2 isotope exchange reaction catalyzed by plasmonic excitation of Au nanoparticles on TiO 2 support.

Both the copper signal and elemental composition from the ligand remain uniform across the grown film showing effective reactivity on the substrate's surface to form a homogeneous Cu-HHTP thin film. This uniform distribution of metal active sites was desired for efficient exposure and adsorption of target analytes especially for sensing applications. Film uniformity in combination with reduced growth times is key towards the realization of 2D MOF-based electronics where continuous and highly conductive films are desirable yet challenging to process. After confirming the formation of the Cu-HHTP MOF into thin films, we probed the functionality of the material towards molecular sensing especially targeting water contaminants. It has been shown that in quaternary-coordinated MOFs, the MO4 sites tend to exhibit a residual negative charge as shown in Figure a. Furthermore, the predominant charged species is expected to readily undergo oxidative reactions without disturbing the corresponding coordination owing to the bivalent nature of the metal atoms. With abundant electron-rich sites exposed in our 2D films, we envision that Cu-HHTP would be ideal for sensing electron-deficient species. In addition, the oxygen-rich coordination sites render the Cu-HHTP MOF film predominantly hydrophilic, making it an ideal candidate towards analytes with hydrophilic ends.We thus targeted the sensing of perfluoroalkyls (PFAS) which are comprised of a hydrophilic head with an acidic hydrogen (either carboxylic or sulfonic) and a fluorine-rich hydrophobic tail.

Consistent with the ProCho-based LExM studies, IMPACT labeling generated samples with a 5.6x expansion factor (at the 4 h hydrolysis timepoint) and fluorescence signal that correlated well with the pre-LExM image (Figure ). The enhanced resolution of the post-LExM image also enabled identification of distinct membranes in crowded areas, e.g., the nuclear envelope (Figure ). Samples generated with IMPACT were similarly obtained in a tunable manner with isotropic expansion and were amenable to colocalization studies with organelle markers (Figures ). Importantly, treatment with a pan-PLD inhibitor prevented fluorescent labeling in pre-LExM images (Figure ). Finally, we applied LExM to study specific sub-diffraction scale cellular structures.Metabolic labeling of phospholipids revealed channels that traverse nuclei, which we hypothesized were a unique class of structures known as nuclear invaginations (Video S1). These channels, comprised of nuclear membrane surrounded by lamina that envelop cytoplasmic contents, can travel through nuclei. Because of their narrow dimensions, their detailed analysis has been limited to electron microscopy and traditional super-resolution microscopy (e.g., STED/SMLM).

The total error for the two scans was given by:Error Total = 0.928 \u00d7 Error Ala + 0.072 \u00d7 Error Gly (6)  with the prefactors corresponding to the relative frequency of each amino acid in the human proteome. Preliminary testing (Section S1.1) showed that a weighting function and regularization did not significantly improve the conformations sampled during the dipeptide MD simulations and so were not used (\u03bb = 0, W = 0).The remaining dipeptides, threonine and serine (both of which contain aliphatic hydroxyl groups in their sidechain), were assigned identical backbone parameters that were fit to reproduce the QM scans of serine. For these scans, regularization and weighting were shown to be necessary to produce dipeptide dynamics which were in agreement with experiment.An investigation of how the simulation error changes with regularization is given in Section S1.2. The harmonic restraint parameter was set to \u03bb = 0.05.The sidechain scans for all dipeptides followed the same fitting process as the alanine/glycine backbone with no weighting or regularization used. As atom-typing is not used for the non-bonded parameter assignment in the QUBE force field, each set of sidechain torsional parameters is also residue-specific.

From the singlet states, most population is then transferred to the 3 T 2 states, while only a small amount of ca. 1% survives for long simulation times in the singlet states.From the 3 T 2 states, the population then relaxes back to the 3 T 1 ground states.We had previously discussed the possible influence of using CASPT2 to parametrize the LVC potentials in the Supporting Information of Ref. 1. There, we argued that using CASPT2 in place of CASSCF energies would lead to three differences. First, the 3 T 1 \u2032 --\u2192 3 A 2 internal conversion would be partially quenched through shifting of 3 A 2 energies. This hypothesis is realized in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics, that now show only 50% of the population moving via the 3 T 1 \u2032 --\u2192 3 A 2 pathway compared to the 70% of the CASSCF dynamics. Second, the long-lived singlet population would increase through partial quenching of the Sing --\u2192 3 T 2 back-intersystem crossing. This second hypothesis is also realized in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics The CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics thereby not only show a larger total retention of singlet population at extended simulation times, i.e., 9% in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics vs. 1% in the CASSCF dynamics. The CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics also show a larger relative retention, as the singlet population falls from the maximum of 43% to 9%, i.e,. to ca. a fifth of its maximum value, while it falls from 10% to 1%, i.e., a tenth of its maximum value in the CASSCF dynamics. Third, we argued that due to the stabilization of the 3 T 1 \u2032 states, they may receive more population during the dynamics which in turn could lead to larger population transfer to the singlet states. While the first part of this hypothesis has not been proven fulfilled, i.e., there is not more population channel through the 3 T 1 \u2032 states in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics compared to the CASSCF dynamics, we find indeed larger \nQuestion:\n How does the retention of the singlet population at extended simulation times in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics compare to that in the CASSCF dynamics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The retention of the singlet population at extended simulation times is higher in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics compared to the CASSCF dynamics.", "weight": 1}]}

It is necessary to ensure that the safety standards for handling hydrogen are at least as high as those for natural gas. \u2022 Since the flame temperature of hydrogen (2180-2210 o C) is higher than that of natural gas (1930-1960 o C) , there is a growing concern that burning hydrogen can lead to an increase in (mainly thermal) NOx emissions as a result of the increased flame temperature. In this case, current developments in combustion technology and burner design are underway to solve this problem.As mentioned before, hydrogen can also be used as feedstock i.e., as a chemical reagent to take part in the Haber-Bosch process to produce ammonia:3H2 + N2 -> 2NH3 (4)Using hydrogen to produce ammonia is a well-established process. However, it has a disadvantagehydrogen can also be obtained from natural gas through steam methane reforming (SMR). As a result, substituting hydrogen in ammonia plants is primarily a cost optimization challenge.Hydrogen can be feedstock within the production of steel, namely the direct reduction of iron: 3Fe2O3 + 9H2 -> 6Fe + 9H2O (5)  InJa[a steel production, the challenge is exacerbated by the existing flexibility in the current steel manufacturing processes: iron can be reduced not only with hydrogen but also with carbon monoxide, involving other types of possibly more polluting fuels such as coke-oven gas, refinery bottoms, coal, and pet coke, which can be used in the process.

Haber-Bosch facilities are currently built in locations that have access to natural gas and are close to chemical industrial centers. The cost of ammonia production today is heavily influenced by the scale of production and the price of natural gas (Figure ). Smaller production scales result in higher production costs due to limited economies of scale, equipment costs, and labor costs that do not decrease proportionately with the scale. Ideally, Haber-Bosch facilities operate on production scales in the range of thousands of metric tons per day, enabling them to achieve production costs as low as 250 USD/t N H 3 when natural gas prices are low (\u223c 2 USD/MMBtu). However, as production scales decrease (\u223c 50 tpd), the production cost can increase by more than five times to 1,300 USD/t N H 3 . Moreover, even at large production scales, the production cost of ammonia is highly sensitive to natural gas prices. In early 2022, natural gas prices went from around 2 USD/MMBtu to over 40 Given the centralized nature of the Haber-Bosch process, there are fewer than a hundred production facilities worldwide. These facilities are predominantly located in rich countries that have access to inexpensive natural gas and advanced chemical infrastructure. The average distance between the Haber-Bosch facilities and farms is around 1,200  km. However, it is important to note that despite the presence of nearby Haber-Bosch facilities, certain regions in the world still struggle to meet their regional demand for ammonia. This can be attributed to various factors such as limited infrastructure, inadequate access to resources, or economic constraints. In such cases, the proximity of centralized production facilities may not be sufficient to address the specific \nQuestion:\n Why does the cost of ammonia production increase as the production scale decreases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The cost of ammonia production increases as the production scale decreases due to limited economies of scale, higher equipment costs, and labor costs that do not decrease proportionately with the scale.

In general, the TGA profile of these samples exhibited the same shape only differing strongly in the initial drop in weight for a temperature up to 100\u00b0C. Following the methodology proposed in previous publications , three different weight loss regions were defined in the thermograms. Region I, from 25 to 100\u00b0 C, was associated with the volatilization of adsorbed water. In this region, the weight loss of the materials followed the trend: ZrBTC-52.4 (16.61%) < ZrBTC-83.5 (19.28%) < ZrBTC-114.6 (24.52%). These differences suggest that an increase in the concentration of the modulator enhances the capacity for retaining adsorbed water. According to the literature , this is a consequence of a modification of the porous structure and the surface area of the materials. Indeed, we will show later that ZrBTC-114.6 had the highest surface area among the synthesized MOFs. The weight loss in Region II, from 100 to 400 \u00b0C, was attributed to the removal of monocarboxylate linkers, DMF (solvent), and the dehydroxylation of the zirconium cluster. As the removal of the monocarboxylate linker (in this case acetate) and the dehydroxylation of the zirconium cluster occur within the same range, their differentiation is aimless. In this case, the recorded weight losses were basically the same: namely, ZrBTC-83.5 (17.8%) ~ ZrBTC-114.6 (18.7%) ~ ZrBTC 52.4 (19.4%). Therefore, the concentration of the modulator did not seem to induce an effect on the events occurring when submitting the samples to these conditions.

In support of this observation, Lohman and coworkers' recently revealed that T4 DNA ligase bound more strongly to a nicked duplex over a duplex (Knet,nick = 2.5 -3.3 x 10 8 M -1 and Knet,duplex = 2.8 -7.25 x 10 6 M -1 , respectively). This difference in magnitude of 10 2 in the enzyme binding affinity can help explain how the KA, prod/KA, inter ratio in the absence of the enzyme shrank from 10 3 -10 4 to 10 2 in the presence of the enzyme. The KA from the kinetic model contains contributions from both the intrinsic binding affinity of the DNA and the binding affinity of the enzyme for the complexes, so both of these effective Kprod and Kinter values are expected to increase in the presence of the enzyme. The change in Kinter is consistent with a higher binding constant for the intermediate complex in the presence of enzyme. Although the effective Kprod (with enzyme) is slightly lower than the K of the product duplex from ITC, we believe that this <4-fold difference is not significant, and that the stability of the product duplex is essentially unaffected by the presence or absence of ligase. ).

Pyrene-based materials have found application in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs). One of the most important driving forces enabling the use of pyrene over a wide range of applications is the possible functionalization of its molecular backbone. Accordingly, previous research in the field has focused on modifying the properties of pyrene by introducing substituents at the periphery of the molecule or by incorporating pyrene units into semiconducting polymers. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the \uf070-electron system on the properties of pyrene has not yet been addressed.During the past years, the importance of topology for the molecular properties of organic semiconductors has been increasingly recognized. The inherent promise for performance improvements resulted in a revived interest in nonalternant \uf070-electron systems and first efforts to use the related molecules in (opto)electronic devices have been made.

However, unlike HPLC, the optimum linear velocity zone in SFC is much flatter due to higher diffusion coefficients (B term) and rapid mass transfer (C term), enabling the users to set the flow rate at a higher linear velocity without compromising much of the chromatographic efficiency. Therefore, a higher flow rate can be implemented in SFC while still staying in the optimum linear velocity zone by improving the separation speed while maintaining good resolution. Especially in SFC, optimization of the flow rate is very critical because increasing the flow rate not only speeds up the separation but also increases the pressure drop across the column and the connecting tubing, which subsequently increases the density gradient of the mobile phase, which may have some impact on the selectivity of the compounds. In this study, the effect of flow rate on the separation of the molecular glass mixture was investigated from 1.3 mL/min to 2.5 mL/min, which provided a total run time of about 12 min and under 6.0 min, respectively. The resolution profile [see Figure ] of the major peaks as a function of increasing flow rates shows that there was a modest decrease in resolution between most peak pairs as the flow rate was increased. However, the resolution between the peaks d and e slightly increased at the higher flow rates as the peaks got narrower. Therefore, depending on the objective of the separation, whether it is purification or impurity profiling, the optimum flow rate can be selected.  \nQuestion:\n How does the total run time compare when using a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min versus 2.5 mL/min in the study?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The total run time at a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min is about 12 minutes, which is longer compared to under 6.0 minutes at a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min.", "weight": 1}]}

The computed relative binding free energy of indole and benzofuran to the lysozyme protein using the environment-specific force fields (-0.4 kcal/mol) was in excellent agreement with experiment (-0.6 kcal/mol), and was substantially more accurate than standard force fields (-2.4 kcal/mol).

However, this conventional sublimation technique has several downsides. For example, this technique frequently requires multiple sublimation cycles causing the entire process to take up to several days to achieve the desired purity level. This technique also results in lower yield due to loss of materials. Therefore, this process is time-consuming and less efficient.

This process is described in detail in Sec. S3 of the supplementary material.

Because existing biomaterial microarrays are not compatible with Raman microspectroscopy, here, we develop an inexpensive substrate that is compatible with both single-cell Raman spectroscopy and the chemistries that are often used for biomaterial microarray fabrication. Standard deposition techniques were used to fabricate a custom Raman-compatible substrate that supports microarray construction.

This analysis was carried out thanks to an in-house PyChimera script applied on ca. 171000 metal-binding sites. It ended up with a list of ca. 500000 entries (Table ) after cleaning the database from metaldonor distances lower than 1.5 \u00c5 or greater than 3.0 \u00c5. From the 500000 entries, a range of values was obtained for each geometric feature Ma, Mb, Mab (Table , Figure ). For histidine, the subranges obtained for His\u1e9f and His\u03b5 tautomers were merged. Although the analysis of coordination by backbone atoms was undertaken for each amino acid, the final results (Table ) presented a large overlap. In consequence, a global range for MO and MOC was considered for all the entries: MO, distance metalbackbone oxygen from 1.809 \u00c5 to 3.000 \u00c5; and MOC, angle metalbackbone oxygen -backbone carbon from 1.774 Rad to 3.139 Rad.Further analyses were conducted to provide a series of default parameters for a prototypical prediction. It first emerges that 80% of donor atoms are part of the side chains (Table ), and 19% are part of the backbone (Table ). Default calculations in BioMetAll were therefore set to look for side chains primarily and left backbone coordination as optional. For side chains, the 89% of coordinating atoms comes from what we called canonical metal coordinating amino acids namely Asp, His, Glu and Cys while a 10.9% belongs to non-canonical amino acids (Asn, Thr, \nQuestion:\n This analysis was carried out thanks to what applied on ca. 171000 metal-binding sites?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: an in-house PyChimera script", "weight": 1}]}

In fact, the self-replication of nucleic acids remains strongly hindered by product inhibition, even when enzymes are present.Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self-replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved.Previously, our group reported lesion-induced DNA amplification (LIDA), which is an isothermal ligase chain reaction. It was proposed that the lesion, a destabilizing abasic group, played an important role in reducing product inhibition. However, using abasic groups in non-enzymatic ligation cycles did not yield appreciable amplification. In order to identify the unknown factors that overcome product inhibition in LIDA, we have performed a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the process, employing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and global fitting of PAGE fluorescence data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We found that in the absence of an enzyme, the ligated product binds four to five orders of magnitude more tightly to the template than to the shorter unligated strands of the intermediate complex. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase, this stability gap was reduced by two orders of magnitude, such that the intermediate and product complexes were roughly equal in stability. Thus, the ligase helps overcome product inhibition by reducing the affinity difference between the DNA product duplex and the intermediate complex. Furthermore, kinetic simulations showed that the stability of the intermediate complex, as well as the rate constant of ligation, significantly impacts the rate of self-replication, suggesting that catalysts that stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to \nQuestion:\n How many orders of magnitude more tightly does the ligated product bind to the template than to the shorter unligated strands of the intermediate complex in the absence of an enzyme?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Four to five orders of magnitude", "weight": 1}]}

The process of adding dummy atoms and dealing with the additional degrees of freedom they bring to the optimization problem poses a difficulty for automation efforts.To address these issues and to enable efficient optimization of molecular saddle points, our algorithm defines internal coordinates and replaces pathological linear bending angles with more well-defined coordinates. If necessary, our algorithm will add dummy atoms to the system automatically at the beginning of the optimization for the purpose of defining new coordinates to replace linear bending angles. Moreover, if previously well-defined bending angles become linear mid-optimization, our algorithm will automatically replace those coordinates without interrupting the optimization procedure. This resolves the common problem of initially well-defined coordinate systems becoming invalid partway through optimization, resulting in a crash or other error.When adding dummy atoms to the optimization problem, our algorithm also adds constraints to counteract the added Cartesian degrees of freedom generated by the dummy atoms. This enables the optimization of a wide range of molecular geometries in an efficient redundant internal coordinate system. This capability renders our algorithm a highly effective and robust geometry optimizer for automated workflows that explore reactive potential energy surfaces, such as KinBot. Further, constrained optimizations, such as relaxed scans, are often used to explore aspects of the potential energy surface and are thus also part of automated workflows.Additionally, the presence of dummy atoms necessitates the addition of constraints, as previously described.

These spintronic semiconducting materials have their VBM and CBM fully polarized in the opposite spin direction, with their spin-up and spin-down channels off-shifted. In BMSs, it is possible to generate fully spin-polarized electrons by applying a gate voltage. Taking V-05 as an example (see Figure ), under zero gate voltage it presents semiconducting behavior. Further, at an appropriate negative gate voltage, the Fermi level is shifted down (in the vacuum scale), resulting in a conductive spin-up channel and semiconducting spin down-channel. Additionally, at an appropriate positive gate voltage, the Fermi level is shifted up, resulting in a conductive spin-down channel and semiconducting spin-up channel. Even though 2D-COF-V-05 presents appropriate BMS band edges, its density of states has large gaps within the band structure, making it difficult for electrons to travel throughout the material.

Most importantly, the large gaps below the VBM and above the CBM are substantially reduced, which results in enhanced available electronic states within the material. This is an important result, as we see that spintronic behavior in 2D COFs can be fine tuned by the number of layers, which is an effect that has not been researched in the past for this family of compounds.We conclude this section for electronic and spintronic properties by mentioning that 2D-COF-Mn-05 presents a peculiar band \nQuestion:\n What can be generated in BMSs by applying a gate voltage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Fully spin-polarized electrons", "weight": 1}]}

DD is produced in a wide range of applications, such as in radiative environments including nuclear reactors, accelerators and the space, in the fabrication of semiconductor devices with ion implantation and ion beam deposition technologies, and in ion-beam related analysis techniques such as the secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Direct experimental measurements of the DD generation have been difficult due to the small spatial and temporal scales, and much effort has been devoted to simulation studies. A large number of atoms are needed for simulating the DD generation, since its collision cascades may span several nanometers. The number of atoms exceeds the ability of highly accurate ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) methods such as the density functional theory (DFT).

The large eddy turnover time for impinging sheets is approximately equal to the residence time of liquid in the impingement zone. Since energy is only dissipated in the impingement zone and turbulence is damped within one large eddy turnover time, stretching or folding of lamella was assumed to be negligible.Turbulence energy cascade theory assumes that large or integral eddies supply energy to small eddies at a rate that is inversely proportional to the large-eddy turnover time. Energy is passed down to smaller eddies in the inertial range until it is ultimately dissipated by eddy sizes in which viscous forces dominate (dissipation range). Thus, the EDD model, as employed for impinging sheets, assumed that the fixed striation or slab size was the Kolmorogov microscale (\ud835\udf02).The results of the azo-coupling study indicated that the Kolmogorov microscale provided a satisfactory estimate for the slab thickness for liquids at a viscosity of 1 cP. However, at higher viscosities, setting the slab thickness to \ud835\udf02 severely underestimated the thickness in which diffusion and reaction occurred. In order for the experimental results to agree with the EDD model, a significantly larger microscale was used. This microscale was intuitively derived by setting the slab thickness approximately equal to the size scale at which the energy dissipation rate is equal to the viscous dissipation rate. The overall micromixing results were explained as flow in the low-viscosity experiments was turbulent and flow in the higher viscosity experiments was pre-turbulent or transitional between laminar flow and fully-developed turbulence.The range of Reynolds numbers in which fully-developed turbulence occurs depends upon the system.

The HOMO\u2192LUMO dipole transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and therefore the LUMO energy does not control the optical band gap. (It should be noted that the HOMO\u2192LUMO transition might still be responsible for a very weak signal at about 1.8 eV as shown in Figure in the SI, which is neglected for the following calculations.) For pyrene, the HOMO\u2192LUMO transition is allowed and determines the optical band gap. If the difference between the optical band gap and the electronic band gap is to be calculated in a meaningful manner using electronic \"frozen orbital\" transition energies, the LUMO has to be excluded for azupyrene. Accordingly, the DFT-calculated electronic band gap of azupyrene increases from 2.96 eV to 3.62 eV. With this value the difference between the DFT-based \"frozen orbital\" electronic band gap and the (experimental) optical band gap is 1.08 eV (= 3.62 eV -2.54 eV) for azupyrene, while the same difference is only 0.20 eV (= 3.83 eV -3.63 eV) for pyrene. The large deviation between the electronic and optical band gap for azupyrene is a direct consequence of its nonalternant \uf070-electron system. This topological property of azupyrene leads to a localization of the molecular orbitals.

Therefore, the redshifting behaviour of MOF vibrational modes at higher temperatures bears a resemblance to soft modes.To understand the connection between dynamic bonding, soft modes, and phase changes in MOFs, our group has studied the spin crossover (SCO) MOF Fe(1,2,3-triazolate)2 (Fig. ), which possesses among the largest magnetic hysteresis windows and most abrupt magnetic transitions of any SCO molecule or material. As evidenced by VT-DRIFTS, the triazolate vibrational modes displayed temperature dependence. As was observed for the dynamic bonds in carboxylate MOFs, the shift in wavenumbers can be attributed to the coexistence of \"tight\" and \"loose\" states in equilibrium. Interestingly, an inversion in the vibrational redshift was observed at the SCO transition temperature (Fig. ). This phenomenon is analogous to the behaviour observed for the soft phonon modes associated with phase transitions in SrTiO3 (Fig ). To further establish the presence of dynamic bonding in metal-triazolate MOFs, but to eliminate the effects of SCO, the isostructural Mn, Co, Cu, and Zn triazolates were studied. Analysis of these DRIFTS data yielded ln Ktl values ranging from 0.67-1.97. Interestingly, the Cu variant, which undergoes a tetragonal-to-cubic structural phase change at higher temperatures, also displayed a V-shaped inversion to its triazolate vibrational frequencies at the critical temperature.

Since the surge in interest by US-based car manufacturers to develop hydrogen cars in the 1990's, hydrogen has ever since been promoted as a substitute for gasoline and diesel (and to a lesser extent, for liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, and liquefied natural gas, LNG). As is the case for industrial end-users looking for a substitute to fossil-fuel combustion, hydrogen could be used in an internal combustion engine (ICE), although the vehicle would probably need to be adjusted to fze the hydrogen consumption. The other main applications for extracting energy from hydrogen are proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, considered mainly due to their higher efficiency (~50%) with respect to ICEs (~30%); the operation of PEM fuel cells has already been extensively covered in the literature. There are several kinds of mobility applications including LDVs (light-duty vehicles i.e., passenger cars), MDVs (medium-duty vehicles e.g., vans, public transport buses), and HDVs (heavy-duty vehicles like long-haul trucks and coaches).Regarding LDVs, fuel cell vehicles have existed in the market for longer than a decade, with Japanese and Korean car manufacturers being the most prominent in the market. The main challenge with respect to LDVs is the availability of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs), although the current support for hydrogen-based mobility has accelerated the HRS market, from 330 stations available in 2017 to 540 in 2020. Besides the infrastructure availability, the cost of the LDVs fuel cell and hydrogen as fuel are considered a challenge to be overcome by the development of both suitable transport and storage infrastructure.

Weak, long-range interactions (vdW and London dispersion forces) were taken into consideration through Grimme's third-order dispersion correction (-D3). All 2D COFs have P6m2 hexagonal symmetry, which was constrained throughout the optimization of atomic positions and lattice parameters. All structures were fully optimized in atomic positions and lattice parameters. Calculations were performed using the CRYSTAL17 code, which uses atom-centered Gaussian basis sets to describe atomic orbitals, allowing an efficient implementation of Post-Hartree-Fock methods (such as hybrid DFT). To avoid self-interactions due to periodic boundary conditions in the slabs, we have considered a vacuum space of 500 \u00c5, resulting in essentially no periodicity in the z-direction. This is possible due to the use of localized Gaussian Type Orbitals (GTOs). GTOs present an advantage over plane wave basis sets, as the latter become significantly more resource-intensive with the addition of vacuum space. Triple-zeta valence with polarization (TZVP) quality basis sets were used for all atoms in the 2D COF calculations.

The 2DES measurements were collected using a home-built femtosecond pump-probe geometry 2DES setup. A 1kHz regenerativeamplifier laser system, Coherent (Libra), was used to power a home-built single-pass noncolinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA). The NOPA output was compressed using a prism compression line and later split to generate pump and probe pulses. The pump pulse was passed through a pulse shaper, FASTLITE Dazzler, to provide controllable variable time delay between two collinear pump pulses. This delay between the two pump pulses is called t1 or the coherence time, and the delay between the pump pulses and the probe is called t2 or the population time. The spot size of the pump and probe beams at the sample position was approximately 80 \u00b5m.

The truncation to a finite basis assumes that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are ordered so that from a certain value of N and on it is the case that . As is well known, a finite spectral expansion is the best approximation for the density matrix in the sense of a minimal norm of the error squared . For such values of the temperature that the numerical rank of the density matrix is lower than N. At a sufficiently high , low temperature, and assuming a finite gap between a non-degenerate ground and lowest excited state, one can reduce the numerical rank towards unity. In this limit the density tends to that of a pure (ground) state. At a low rank it is numerically not practical to go from the density to its surprisal. The other direction, to determine the density from its surprisal, is possible at all temperatures.The eigenstates that diagonalize the density matrix will also diagonalize the matrix of the surprisal. This enables a simple transformation of the time-dependent surprisal to the density matrix. When it is a thermal initial state the eigenstates at the initial time correspond to the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian . As the dynamics unfolds the eigenstates need to be determined by diagonalization of the surprisal. In this paper we assume that the system is isolated in the sense that it is not interacting with its environment.

For these codes, the effective number of gradient evaluations is taken to be the number of geometry optimization steps plus a factor of 3n to account for evaluation of the Hessian matrix in full. We note that the cost of evaluating the Hessian matrix using analytical methods -such as coupled-perturbed Hartree-Fock or density functional perturbation theory -is generally lower than the cost of 3n gradient evaluations. However, when analytical Hessians are not available, the actual cost of evaluating the full Hessian matrix will be at least 3n, rising to 6n if central finite difference is used. Based on the result in figure , NWChem, Q-Chem, and Psi4 all show comparable performance to Sella when the Hessian is fully diagonalized. NWChem shows the overall worst performance, likely due to its use of a minimal Z-matrix internal coordinate basis rather than a redundant internal coordinate basis. Nonredundant internal coordinate systems such as the Zmatrix approach necessarily omit some chemically relevant degrees of freedom from the coordinate system, which can have a deleterious impact on optimization performance.As with figure , several of the data points lie below the line, indicating that Sella converges more slowly for these points. This is again likely due to a failure of the diagonalization algorithm to correctly identify the lowest curvature mode, a problem that can be ameliorated by tightening the diagonalization convergence criterion \u03b3.When bending angles become linear mid-optimization, Q-Chem will by default automatically switch to a Cartesian coordinate optimization in order to avoid crashing.We have disabled this feature in our calculations, as leaving it enabled would result in \nQuestion:\n What action does Q-Chem take when bending angles become linear mid-optimization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Q-Chem automatically switches to a Cartesian coordinate optimization.", "weight": 1}]}

We previously showed that VLCFAs interact with membranes and disrupt their integrity in model liposomes and molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the modest increases of VLCFAs during necroptosis, we proposed that the incorporation of VLCFAs into proteins can facilitate their recruitment to defined membrane domains and allow high local concentrations of these lipids at the membrane and perturb membrane integrity .

Several PIP species are known to be actively involved in cell signaling cascades, both in endogenous processes as well as in mechanisms of action of viruses and other pathogens. Protein-lipid interactions can alter lipid patterns on the membrane via electrostatic interactions or amino acid insertion into the bilayer.

Based on this fact, Behler and co-workers exploited the high flexibility of the NN to search the poorly sampled regions of the configuration space. Namely, if some points possess large energy deviations between two NN fits, they were added to the training set. Recently, Lin et al. proposed a trajectory-free active learning method, based on this idea, to iteratively add new data points for sampling. It has been demonstrated that an accurate PES can be developed with much fewer points than the trajectory-based methods.In this work, we also utilize the limited extrapolation capabilities of NN potential to select points from the DFT dataset. First, 1500 points were chosen from the DFT dataset and then calculated to obtain their electronic energies at the UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ level. For these 1500 points, 500 geometries were selected near the equilibrium of the stationary points, and another 1000 were well dispersed along the MEP from reactants to products. Note that a larger Euclidean distance Then the PIP-NN fitting was carried out to obtain the preliminary correction PES. To minimize the random error of NN fit, according to the NN ensemble approach, four best NN fittings were chosen to calculate the average energy difference among them, namely, ASSOCIATED CONTENTFigure 1 .1Figure 1.

As it can be seen in the transition state, the protonation occurs before the nucleophilic attack by Asp196. The anticipated protonation of the glycosidic oxygen Og by the catalytic general acid Asp319 activates the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Indeed, in the ETS structure, the release of the leaving group (+1 sugar) has started (d3 = 2.15 \u00c5, Figure ) before the glycosil-Asp196 bond has been formed (dOn-C1' = 2.37 \u00c5).

The Mulliken atomic charges and also the Natural Charges on the nitrogen atoms in species 5-6 and also 8-9 may provide a measure of electron deficiency on these centres to correlate with the relative electron accepting abilities of NO2 and NO groups.The details of the results are as follows:1. The LUMO energies of CH2=CHNO2, CH2=CHNO and CH2=CHCHO were estimated at 28.0, 33.8 and 49.7 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating larger resonance acceptor ability of NO2 over both NO and CHO groups. The overall decreasing order of resonance acceptor ability, therefore, is NO2 > NO > CHO.2. The \uf073C2Hax\u2192\uf073CN interaction measures 6.8 and 4.9 kcal/mol in the lowest energy conformers of 5 and 6, respectively. These numbers favor greater \uf073-electron attracting ability of NO2 than NO. The corresponding interaction \uf073C2Hax\u2192\uf073CC(=O) in 7 is 4.5 kcal/mol.

The magnitude of this increase in the experimental data over 8 ns is about 2.3% of the GSB magnitude, which is approximately equivalent to 0.041 mOD. An upper bound of 0.049 mOD T 1 absorption is therefore a reasonable estimate.For TIPS-Tn, SF begins to produce the same amount of triplet excitons as the upper limit of ISC at a concentration of 2.1 mM. At 8 mM, this rate of ISC would account for 22% of triplets formed by 8 ns. So as with TIPS-Pn, the assumption of negligible ISC when fitting the bimolecular SF rate constant is potentially invalid. Refitting the deconvoluted concentrations of the 8 mM TA with an ISC rate constant of 8.50 \u00d7 10 6 s -1 , gives a bimolecular SF rate constant of (2.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 9 M -1 s -1 (supplementary material Sec.

Using this adjusted rate at 0.05 mM results in 2.7\u00d710 -10 M of triplets formed due to SF, which is still substantially lower than the limit of detection, so an upper bound of 118 ns for ISC is still valid. As with TIPS-Pn, the 8 mM TIPS-Tn S 1 population decays faster and fits slightly better than without ISC. Given that 8.50 \u00d7 10 6 s -1 is an upper bound on the ISC rate constant, the range of bimolecular SF rate constants can now be considered to be between 1.4 \u00d7 10 9 M -1 s -1 (lower bound of T 1 concentration, upper bound of ISC) to 3.2\u00d710 9 M -1 s -1 (upper bound of T 1 concentration, no ISC), or (2.3\u00b10.9)\u00d710 9 M -1 s -1 .We again note that, as for TIPS-Pn, the adjusted value of the SF rate constant does not affect the previously determined upper bound for the ISC rate constant. These results especially highlight the necessity to consider ISC when quantifying SF, even if it is assumed to be slow, as without doing so, the SF rate constant could potentially be overestimated. \nQuestion:\n What is the magnitude of the increase in the experimental data over 8 ns as a percentage of the GSB magnitude?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: 2.3%", "weight": 1}]}

We describe the structural and electronic properties of the pristine bilayer 2D COF. This structure presents insulating electronic character (bandgap of 3.40 eV). In this material, carbon atoms are the main contributors to the electronic states surrounding the Fermi level. Next, we generated sixty-three intercalated bilayer structures with nine first-row transition metals. Our analyses reveal that the type, concentration, and position of intercalants changes their structural, magnetic, and electronic features. Structurally, intercalation results in changes in the interlayer distance, which can be directly related to interaction strength between the transition metals and the bilayer. The structural analysis was complemented with a binding energy analysis, where we observe that transition metal intercalation is energetically preferred at the centroid of benzene rings, followed by triazine and boroxine. This indicates that-generally-during intercalation, the centroid of benzene rings will be populated first, followed by triazine, and finally boroxine. Magnetically, we observe a wide range of stable spin configurations (FM, FiM, AFM, NM), which depend on the type, position, and concentration of intercalants. This wide range of magnetic features allows to fine-tune and enhance 2D COFs' features for photocatalytic, electronic, and spintronic applications. In general, we find that transition metal d-orbitals have important contributions to the density of states around the Fermi level and can even promote the contribution of C, N, B, and O atoms around the Fermi level. Within our sixty-three intercalated bilayer 2D COFs, we find that twenty-four of our materials are conductors in at \nQuestion:\n How does the type, concentration, and position of intercalants affect the structural, magnetic, and electronic features of triazinebenzene-boroxine 2D COFs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The type, concentration, and position of intercalants change the structural, magnetic, and electronic features of triazinebenzene-boroxine 2D COFs.

The orange-highlighted bonds in figure indicate the dihedral angle that is being scanned, which includes several atoms involved in the reaction corresponding to this saddle point. This scan reveals that the structure found by Sella (the structure at zero degrees) is not the lowest-energy conformer for this reaction. This is not surprising, as our saddle point optimization algorithm tends to converge to the saddle point that is geometrically closest to the initial structure, and this may not be the lowest energy conformer.Figure shows how the total number of gradient evaluations required to perform the entire scan (in green) and the number of gradient evaluations per scan step (in red) scale as a function of the number of scan steps used. For this scan, between 12 and 360 steps were used, which corresponds to a dihedral angle step size of between 30\u00b0and 1\u00b0. Though the total number of gradient evaluations tends to increase with the number of steps used in the scan, the relationship is not perfectly linear. One possible explanation for this is that larger steps in the scan will tend to perturb the unconstrained degrees of freedom more, therefore requiring more gradient evaluations to converge. The upper limit of this plot indicates that when 360 1\u00b0steps are used, only 1.61 gradient evaluations are required per grid point. This is very close to the theoretical lower limit of 1 gradient evaluation per step (the dashed red line), in which each step of the scan converges in a single gradient evaluation.

Interestingly, all of the scenarios have the same trend between the number of production regions and the average distribution distance (Figure ). For all scenarios, the average ammonia distribution distance decreases from a maximum of 7,627 km for one production region to a minimum of 155 km for 6,000 production regions.A Pareto frontier highlights the tradeoff between production cost and distribution distance in optimal solutions (Figure ). The marginal change in the average ammonia production cost is inversely proportional to the average distribution distance. For instance, decreasing the average distribution distance by 50% from the most centralized scenario (one facility) results in a 5% increase in the average ammonia production costs.In contrast, decreasing the average distribution distance by 75% from the most centralized scenario (one facility) results in a 15% increase in the average ammonia production costs. Finally, decreasing the average distribution distance by 95% from the most centralized scenario (one facility) results in a 35% increase in the average ammonia production costs. These results highlight the tradeoff in decentralization and production cost, emphasizing the importance of selecting the number of regional production regions so that the production costs remain low while having low distribution distances that are resilient to changes in transportation costs.To understand the production cost and the response to changes in the transportation cost of different wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production networks, we performed a network optimization analysis for a centralized (100 production regions), partially decentralized (500 production regions), and fully decentralized scenario (3,000 production regions).

The arene fragment interacts with the Ni-Ni core via both a s-bond and a h 2 -interaction, with a bridging pivalate between the two Ni centers. Given that NBO analysis of I showed a symmetrical distribution of charge at the Ni-Ni core, we wondered whether a dynamic motion between the Ni-Ni core might enable a formal translocation of the Ni center at a proximal C(sp 2 ) site by forming a new s-bond and a h 2 -interaction with the arene backbone. If successful, such a process might constitute a formal metal translocation over the arene backbone, thus setting the basis for establishing a new rationale for enabling Ni-catalyzed C(sp 2 )-H functionalization of C-O electrophiles via \"ring-walking\" in the absence of directing groups or metalation events. Prompted by our interest in Ni-catalyzed C-H functionalization, we report herein the successful realization of this goal. Experimental and DFT studies demonstrate the viability for enabling a \"ring-walking\" prior to C-C bond formation, with a mechanism likely arising from an abnormal 1,2-hydride shift.

Using a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) approach, where only first-order terms are included, the model can be parametrized from a single-point calculation including gradients, non-adiabatic couplings and spin-orbit couplings. Alternatively, parameters can be obtained from finitedisplacements around the reference geometry along each normal mode , amounting to \u223c 6N single-point calculations. Notably, this is much less effort than usually required to train machinelearning models to predict potential energy surfaces. While the usage of harmonic normal modes and the truncation to first-order constrain the LVC model to predict meaningful potential energy surfaces only in vicinity of its reference geometry, the rigid structure of many transition-metal complexes confines their motion in photophysical processes close to its starting area, making LVC model a useful approximation in the study of excited-state dynamics of transition-metal complexes.In this work, we leverage the efficiency of the SH/LVC approach to screen the photodynamics of vanadium(III) complexes for their potential use as near-infrared emitters.

In the context of torquoselectivity of 3-substituted cyclobutenes, the substituents influence the ring opening by either or a combination of \uf073C3C4\u2192\uf070*NO/CO and \uf073C3C4\u2192\uf073*NO/CO interactions. The \uf073C3C4\u2192\uf070*NO/CO interaction originates from the \uf073C3C4 orbital being parallel to the\uf020\uf070 orbital of the substituent. Likewise, \uf073C3C4\u2192\uf073*NO/CO interaction arises from \uf073C3C4 orbital being antiperiplanar to the \uf073 orbital of the substituent. While \uf073C3C4\u2192\uf070*NO/CO interaction is typical of allyl anion like resonance interaction, \uf073C3C4\u2192\uf073*NO/CO interaction is akin to antiperiplanar interaction. The intensity of interaction will depend on the resonance accepting ability of the substituent in \uf073C3C4\u2192\uf070*NO/CO interaction and \uf073-electron accepting ability in \uf073C3C4\u2192\uf073*NO/CO interaction; the greater the ability, the more the interaction.In the instance where the group is located on a carbon-carbon \uf070-bond as in CH2=CHX (X = NO2, NO and CHO), \uf070CC\u2192\uf070*NO/CO interaction will constitute a meaningful estimate of the resonance acceptor ability. The larger the interaction, the larger will be the resonance acceptor ability of the group. Further, the larger the \uf070CC\u2192\uf070*NO/CO interaction, the lower will be the LUMO of the conjugated system. Thus, an estimate of the LUMO energy can provide an estimate of the resonance acceptor ability, in inverse relationship.The antiperiplanar interaction of a \uf073 bond with \uf073*CN in the NO2 and NO species and \uf073*CC(=O) in the CHO species in a geometrically well-defined arrangement, such as in substituted cyclohexane, provides a reasonably good measure of the \uf073-electron attracting ability of the substituent. For instance, the \uf073C2Hax\u2192\uf073*C1X (X = N, C(=O)) interaction in 5-7 and \uf073C2C3\u2192\uf073*C1X interaction in 8-10, Figure , are destined to indicate the relative \uf073-electron attracting strengths.

Upper limit on intersystem crossingWe have concluded that no triplet excitons, and therefore no ISC, was detected over the 8 ns TA measurements of 0.05 mM TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn. But, there may still be a triplet population that is below the detection limit, that is, some magnitude of triplet excitons that is unresolvable over the time window and at the signal-to-noise ratio present in this study. Given the bimolecular SF rates determined in the previous section, we can estimate the amount of triplet excitons that could be present due to a very small amount of diffusion-limited SF at 0.05 mM, and therefore the amount of triplet excitons that could possibly be present due to ISC.For TIPS-Pn, we determined the noise level in the TA data to be 0.019 mOD from the level of fluctuations around a smoothed spectrum obtained by applying a low-pass filter (supplementary material Sec. S5.1). We consider a change in absorption in the 8 ns time window less than three times this level (i.e. three standard deviations) to be unresolvable, according to the IUPAC recommendation for the limit of detection. That is, the maximum amount of triplet absorption that could be present in the 0.05 mM TIPS-Pn 8 ns spectrum is 0.057 mOD. Any signal higher than this level should be observable, and as Fig. (b) shows, we do not observe any T 1 absorption in the TA spectrum over time (at 504 nm where the T 1 ESA maximum is expected to occur, we in fact observe a slight decrease relative to the GSB, rather than the increase that would result from T 1 formation). Using the lower bound of the triplet basis spectrum at the peak maximum (70640 M -1 cm -1 at 504 nm), this maximum possible T 1 absorption corresponds to a T 1 concentration of 4.0 \u00d7 10 -9 M, or 2.1% of the initial S 1 concentration.To determine the SF contribution to this maximum possible triplet \nQuestion:\n What did we determine the noise level in the TA data to be for TIPS-Pn?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: 0.019 mOD", "weight": 1}]}

If this is really the case for very flexible molecules (e.g. long alkanes) can be tested by comparison of computed and experimental entropies and heat capacities (see Sec. 4.2 and 4.3). Note that our approach works with any (on-the-fly computed) PES and hence, at least in principle, the errors introduced by the underlying method for the PES and the other approximations to the entropy problem could be decomposed.The CREST algorithms were originally developed to generate rotamer containing ensembles and the related nuclei-exchange information for the simulation of NMR spectra . Hence, it seems straightforward not only to identify rotamers, but to extend the algorithm to automatically compute the proper degeneracy number g i . However, as mentioned above, conformer ensembles (CE) must be free from the indistinguishable rotamers to be compatible with entropy calculations. Therefore, g i are treated as unity in the usual case.The only exception here are symmetrical molecules that can form \"enantiomeric\" (i.e., in principle distinguishable) conformers through rotation of bonds. A typical case is the gauche conformer of n-butane. These geometrical enantiomers are degenerate and would be falsely classified as rotamers in our previous implementation. Effectively, this introduces a factor of g i = {1, 2} instead of g i in the degeneracy, depending on if the formation of a geometrical enantiomer is possible. Our new apprach considers this problem for the first time in a correct and automated way. Inserting this into the standard entropy expression for degenerate states leads toS conf = R ln g i e -E i \u03b2 + g i (E i \u03b2)e -E i \u03b2 g i e -E i \u03b2 .(10)The correct S msRRHO entropy is a population average over the \nQuestion:\n How does the degeneracy number 'g i' for usual conformer ensembles compare to that for symmetrical molecules capable of forming enantiomeric conformers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: For usual conformer ensembles, the degeneracy number 'g i' is treated as unity, whereas for symmetrical molecules like the gauche conformer of n-butane, the degeneracy number 'g i' can be either 1 or 2.", "weight": 1}]}

At about 0.006 ps and 0.026 ps, the atom corresponding to the max SDEM is the PKA, and the \u03be logv max SDEM is much smaller than the \u03be v one since the speed of the PKA is large.

For example, although genetic algorithms are inspired by natural selection, there are circumstances where it is advantageous for genetic algorithms to depart from some of the constraints typically found in biological examples of natural selection. For example, in the event that a new generation does not produce a single simulation that outperforms the best fibril fraction from that generation's parent generation, the entire new generation is removed from the breeding process and the parent generation repeats the breeding process in the hopes that a new generation of children will outperform them. Including a copy of all breeding parents in each new generation is also done because, in the event that a consistently high performing parameter arises, it becomes immortal. Another departure from typical biological natural selection is that, in order to ensure more complete sampling of parameter space, every pair of survivor points in parameter space is given the opportunity to breed. Since this condition leads to proliferation on the order of N 2 , where N is the number of breeding parameters (potentially challenging for available computing resources), a hyperparameter was created for the algorithm called childMax, whereby, if a breeding pair produces more children than the value of childMax, that number of child parameters is \nQuestion:\n Why is the entire new generation removed from the breeding process and the parent generation repeats the breeding process in the event that a new generation does not produce a single simulation that outperforms the best fibril fraction from that generation's parent generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The entire new generation is removed and the parent generation repeats the breeding process to provide another opportunity for a new generation of children to potentially outperform the previous generation.

Specifically, we reasoned that ortholactones 1 could be used as bimodal electrophiles, reacting with bis-nucleophilic silyloxy allylsilanes 2 under acidic conditions to directly form a spiroketal group (Scheme 1C). This research was inspired by Mark\u00f3's reports that unsubstituted ortholactones could react with silyloxyallylsilanes to form spiroketals (Scheme 1D).

In both cases we found two free energy minima, corresponding to the dissociated (Figure ) and nondissociated (Figure ) forms. In Figure , the same profiles are reported in units of kT as well. It emerges that at room temperature the shuttling barrier is of the order of kT, hence the shuttling process should be thermally accessible. Indeed, temperature does affect quantitatively the free energy profile: while at 50 K we obtain a free energy barrier of 0.84 kcal/mol, at 300 K the barrier is 1.17 kcal/mol. However, in terms of kT, the barrier amounts to 2.0 kT at 300K while it raises to 8.5 kT at 50 K: hence, overall the shuttling process would be favored upon increasing the temperature. Also, temperature copes to reduce the thermodynamic stability difference between the dissociated and undissociated forms (which is 6.4 kT at 50 K and 0.9 kT at 300 K).Starting from relevant configurations of the 50 K free energy profile, we calculated energy minima (at 0 K) by geometry optimizations at different levels of theory. At the PBE level we found modest energy differences between the two structures, with a preference for the undissociated HCOOH by 0.67 kcal/mol and a (0 K) barrier of 0.75 kcal/mol. We checked also for the effect of dispersion interactions by augmenting the PBE functional with the Grimme D2 correction , in this case the undissociated form is more stable by 0.48 kcal/mol and the shuttling barrier amounts \nQuestion:\n What happens to the shuttling process of HCOOH on anatase when the temperature is increased?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The shuttling process is favored as the temperature increases.", "weight": 1}]}

Simple examples of this importance are found in common metal oxo motifs in metalloenzymes, ranging from the iron-based cytochrome P450 enzymes and methane monooxygenases to molybdenum-based sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. Each of these systems carry out specific chemical reactions that harness high-energy M=O motifs and enable oxidations that would not occur with molecular oxygen alone. Moving down one row in the periodic table, sulfur also plays key roles in biology, particularly during most of Earth's history that was devoid of atmospheric oxygen. For example, the low solubility of metal sulfides helps to potentiate the bioavailability of metals dissolved in oceans and other bodies of water. Similarly, sulfide lowers heavy metal ion toxicity in archaea native to hyperthermophilic vent environments, which were likely early locales capable of supporting life. These reducing environments devoid of oxygen but rich in sulfur provided a home for early chemolithoautotrophic and sulfur-reducing microorganisms that likely built the cornerstones of bioinorganic metal-chalcogen chemistry still found today in modern biology.Under such prebiotic conditions, carbon-containing sulfur compounds, such as carbonyl sulfide (COS), have also been hypothesized to play important roles in developing molecular complexity. For example, COS is the most prevalent sulfur-containing gas in Earth's atmosphere and is often found at elevated concentrations near volcanoes and hot springs. In the presence of amino acids, COS can act as a coupling agent to form dipeptides, aminoacyl phosphates, and aminoacyl adenylates, all of which are important building \nQuestion:\n How does COS act in the presence of amino acids?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: In the presence of amino acids, carbonyl sulfide (COS) acts as a coupling agent to form dipeptides, aminoacyl phosphates, and aminoacyl adenylates, which are important building blocks in biochemistry.", "weight": 1}]}

(Fig. & 2D) These values of kapp for protonated variants are in close agreement with the previous reports on the systems.

Transfer coefficient (\uf061) is an important parameter used in this approach which indicates the symmetry of the energy barrier during the redox process. The value of \uf061 is 0.5 for the ideal case but may vary from 0.5.

This resulted in increases or decreases in the intermediate or product duplex KA values by one order of magnitude (Figure ).

When the stability of the intermediate complex was one order of magnitude higher by increasing k+1 by a factor of 10 the formation of DNA-I and DNA-II was much faster (short, dashed line, Figure ).

We combine this with a multi-objective optimization to determine the optimal wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production locations to match the global fertilizer demand from agriculture. We focus on meeting the demand for agricultural fertilizers while minimizing production costs, distribution costs, and water stress at the production sites.We highlight the potential of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production as a renewable and decentralized alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. We show that to match the highest market price in the last 5 years (\u223c 1,600 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 25% and capital costs below 900 USD/kW, energy efficiencies above 20% and capital costs below 550 USD/kW, or energy efficiencies above 15% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW. If the price of the ammonia market recovers to the lowest market price in the last 5 years, the technologies must achieve energy efficiency greater than 70% and capital costs lower than 200 USD/kW. With the increasing uncertainty of natural gas prices, wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production could become an economical alternative that could decouple natural gas from ammonia production.Additionally, we address the importance of discount rates on the ammonia production cost, distribution distance, and optimal decentralization level. The chosen discount rate is influenced by factors such as inflation, risk, and funding sources, with government funding typically resulting in lower discount rates compared to private funding.

For these codes, the effective number of gradient evaluations is taken to be the number of geometry optimization steps plus a factor of 3n to account for evaluation of the Hessian matrix in full. We note that the cost of evaluating the Hessian matrix using analytical methods -such as coupled-perturbed Hartree-Fock or density functional perturbation theory -is generally lower than the cost of 3n gradient evaluations. However, when analytical Hessians are not available, the actual cost of evaluating the full Hessian matrix will be at least 3n, rising to 6n if central finite difference is used. Based on the result in figure , NWChem, Q-Chem, and Psi4 all show comparable performance to Sella when the Hessian is fully diagonalized. NWChem shows the overall worst performance, likely due to its use of a minimal Z-matrix internal coordinate basis rather than a redundant internal coordinate basis. Nonredundant internal coordinate systems such as the Zmatrix approach necessarily omit some chemically relevant degrees of freedom from the coordinate system, which can have a deleterious impact on optimization performance.As with figure , several of the data points lie below the line, indicating that Sella converges more slowly for these points.

The B3LYP functional gives weaker binding energies than the CCSD(T) benchmarks, and prior work by Zhang et al. suggested that this under-binding becomes more pronounced with increasing molecular size. As such, B3LYP will incur significant errors for the large periodic strands, as we demonstrate in the next section. Based on these benchmark calculations, the B3LYP-D functional most closely matches the CCSD(T) results, particularly for the van-der-Waalsstacked monomers. In contrast, both the BLYP and B3LYP functionals produce geometries that are highly distorted in which the individual Watson-Crick base pairs are not even aligned in the same plane.

Literature examples for the coupling of triflates 8j, 17c and our objectiveNickel catalyzed methods remain rare for aryl sulfonates in general, with limited examples for the coupling of aryl thiols with aryl tosylates 7c and mesylates, but no examples for aryl triflates. Regarding alkenyl electrophiles, only few reports were dedicated to the palladium catalyzed C-S coupling of tosylates 8f and triflates, 8e while nickel catalysed couplings are even more underrepresented. The most recent example is the electrochemically promoted coupling of alkenyl triflates with thiols employing air-sensitive Ni(cod)2 (15 mol%) reported by Pan and co-workers (Scheme 1b). 8j They demonstrated an extensive substrate scope for aryl thiols, but only a limited scope for alkyl thiols(3 examples) providing moderate yields. The inefficient coupling of alkyl thiols, especially tertiary ones is a typical limitation of many C-S coupling methodologies. Our group closed this gap in a study on cross-coupling of aryl chlorides with tertiary alkyl thiols. 7e A promising reactivity of triflates was observed in electrophile competition experiments, which led us to expand the scope of the methodology to aryl and alkenyl triflates (Scheme 1c).

In GCEQ, two different electrodes are immersed in the same sea water container which is similar to normal galvanic cell used for generation of electric potential from chemical reaction.But, the generation of electrode potential in GCEQ is not similar to that of a galvanic cell.In galvanic cell, positive potential arises due to neutralization of cation near cathode and negative potential arises due to the oxidation of anode material. On the other hand, in GCEQ used for generation of electric potential using sea water, a potential arises due to accumulation of charge on the electrodes. We get high and low potentials due to the different charge accumulation capacity of different electrodes.Metal ions present in sea water are highly electro positive than used electrodes (zinc, aluminum, iron and carbon).Thus, normal redox reactions are not possible. Neufeld et. al. reported that electrode potential developed on Zn metal when it is immersed in chloride solution due to charge accumulation through a series of complex reactions. As sea water is highly concentrated solution of chloride, it is expected that if we immerse Zn electrode in sea water we shall get electrode potential. Similar is true for other electrodes also. But, all electrodes get negative potential as only anions are accumulated on electrode. We get potential differences as charge accumulation capacity is different for different electrodes.Theoretically, using GCEQ we get electricity from sea water without loosing the electrode. But, in practice, metal electrodes are destroyed with time due to corrosion.

Since then, different strategies were used to integrate fluorescent moieties into MOFs especially for sensing applications. For instance, it was found that the stiffening of luminophores in networks increases their fluorescence intensity because of decreased vibrational decay. Furthermore, the precise spatial fixation of fluorophores within a lattice can significantly influence the fluorescence properties and lead to interesting effects like J dimer emission or multi emission. Also, phenomena like charge and energy transfer, known from classical coordination chemistry, were observed. In addition to pure ligand-based fluorescence, MOFs containing d 10 ions often exhibit metal-to-ligand (MLCT) and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). Alternatively, fluorophores can be introduced into the pore system. which can lead to interesting emission properties. Another possibility is offered by lanthanide based MOFs in which highly absorbing linker molecules are used to populate the emissive states of the lanthanide and to increase its luminescence. In this work a fluorescent probe was introduced into DUT-49 framework. For this reason, the biphenyl moiety in the H4BBCDC ligand of DUT-49 was exchanged by fluorenone, due to the structural similarity and therefore, expected NGA behavior.

The considered scheme for the removal of the modulator (denoted as M) during such a process is schematized in Figure . The simulation was performed at 110\u00b0C as in agreement with the conditions of activation. Figures show the changes in the distance of zirconium and oxygen atoms during the simulation. Where the zirconium atoms denoted as Zr1 and Zr2 are coordinated to the acetate ion of the framework. According to calculations, the activation process leads to modulator agent removal. Thus, O2 and O8, the oxygen atoms belonging to the acetate ion, move away from Zr1 and Zr2, respectively, leading to bond breaking after 200 fs. It is also observed that the O1 and O7 oxygen atoms belonging to different organic linkers and connected to the Zr1 and Zr2 atoms, respectively, try to separate but at the end of the NVT process, they remained close to the zirconium atoms.

When using redundant internal coordinates or when optimizing a system with constraints, our algorithm uses a variety of projected internal coordinate bases as well.This section outlines how these projected bases are constructed and the relationships between them.The Cartesian coordinate vector of a molecule is represented by the 3n-dimensional vector x, where n is the number of atoms in the molecule. The redundant internal coordinate vector is represented by the m-dimensional vector q, where m \u2265 3n -6.Each element of q corresponds to one of the internal coordinates determined by the algorithm described in appendix A, and m is the total number of internal coordinates that have been determined. In practice, only the Cartesian coordinate vector x behaves as an independent variable for the optimization algorithm, and the internal coordinate vector q is calculated from x. Therefore, all changes to the internal coordinate vector q are realized as changes to x; this has important implications for the iterative diagonalization algorithm described in section 2.3 and the constrained saddle point optimization algorithm described in section 2.4 below. In this work, all undecorated vector and matrix quantities are defined to be in a basis of redundant internal coordinates with the exception of the Cartesian coordinate vector x. Quantities in other coordinate systems will be decorated with an accent character, as described below.In addition to the Cartesian and redundant internal coordinate bases, our algorithm also uses a nonredundant basis which is a linear combination of the redundant internal coordinates. <ref \nQuestion:\n Why does only the Cartesian coordinate vector x behave as an independent variable in the optimization algorithm?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: In the optimization algorithm, only the Cartesian coordinate vector x behaves as an independent variable because the internal coordinate vector q is calculated from x.

In one of the models the Al cation compensates the charges around three Al centers (Al triplets) in one six-membered ring. In the other two models the Al ion is located within sixmembered ring containing two framework Al centers, while the third compensated Al is next to that ring (Al triplet -3 framework Al sites adjacent to each other). Note that the two latter structures are by about 1 eV less stable than the former one. As expected, the calculated CO frequencies correlate with the shortening of the C-O distance in the adsorption complex (Fig. ). Since there is not \u03c0-backdonation contribution in the Al-CO bonding, CO frequencies also correlated with the BE(CO). Despite the lack of \u03c0-backdonation, the Al carbonyl complex that forms, is notably stable.In summary, we identified a new aluminum Lewis acid site in H-FAU. This site is a naked, highly electrophilic Al +3 cation that forms in the sodalite cages of FAU upon dehydration of hydrated Al cations at elevated temperatures. This is the first identification of a bare +3 metal cation in a zeolite that compensates the charge of Al triplets to form an Al quartet. This also proves the existence of such Al triplets in siliceous H-FAU zeolite. Al +3 bare cation interacts strongly with CO, forming a stable Al +3 -CO carbonyl complex with the highest known C-O stretching frequency for any solid material. Our study reveals that isolated +3 trivalent cations can form in zeolites and provides a spectroscopic and theoretical framework to study polyvalent metal interactions with zeolites. This discovery may inspire further incorporation of other trivalent cations into the pores of zeolites and offer novel properties.us \nQuestion:\n Which is more stable, the former model of the Al cation structure or the two latter models?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The former model is more stable than the two latter models by about 1 eV.", "weight": 1}]}

The enhanced resolution of the post-LExM image also enabled identification of distinct membranes in crowded areas, e.g., the nuclear envelope (Figure ).

CV1 is composed by the difference between d1 (distance between the center-of-mass -COM-of the carboxylic oxygen atoms in Asp319 and the proton Ha on the same residue) and d2 (distance between the former Ha atom and the glycosidic oxygen Og in BMA). CV2 is defined as the difference between d3 (distance between the Og oxygen of the +1 ring and the former C1' of the -1 ring) and d4 (distance between the anomeric carbon C1' and the COM of the carboxylate oxygen atoms in Asp196).

RAS-SF wave functionA RAS-SF calculation starts from high-spin, restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) reference orbitals, from which target states of interest are computed by via SF excitations.

( ) includes all configurations within the active space, meaning that RAS-SF resembles a CAS-CI method within the RAS2 space. The RAS1 space contains all doublyoccupied orbitals and RAS3 contains virtual orbitals, and we allow single excitations between these two subspaces and RAS2, corresponding to holes h \u2208 RAS1 and particles p \u2208 RAS3. This particular ansatz has been called RAS(h,p)-SF. To describe CT states, 11 the high-spin reference orbitals are first localized onto molecular fragments, where they are then categorized by subspace (RAS1, RAS2, or RAS3) and by fragment. The RAS Hamiltonian is then partitioned into CT and non-CT blocks, where the latter will also be called the \"locally-excited\" (LE) block. Diagonalization of these blocks provides either the LE states or the CT states, and the latter are further grouped into left-right versus right-left character, or equivalently A \u2192 B versus B \u2192 A (Fig. ). \nQuestion:\n What should the RAS2 space include to describe the electronic states of interest?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The most important orbitals", "weight": 1}]}

At above 1.0 A cm -2 , the bubble coverage became excessive, notably decreasing the active surface area of the electrode. Flowing liquid electrolyte over the electrode significantly decreased the bubble coverage with the fractional coverage dependent on the velocity of flow. In early 2019, Li et al. reported a 'breathable' oxygen-evolving anode that was prepared by sputter coating a thin gold layer onto a porous, hydrophobic polyethylene (PE) membrane, followed by electrodepositing a NiFeOx catalyst onto the gold layer. The 'breathable' nature of the electrode derived from the fact that the resulting NiFeOx/Au/PE electrode produced oxygen from water without producing visible gas bubbles at room temperature; the oxygen was drawn, as it was generated, through the porous PE membrane into a gas chamber at its rear. In so doing, the electrode exhibited a 90 mV lower overpotential at 0.01 A cm -2 than when a non-porous PE substrate was used. The non-porous PE substrate forced the formation of oxygen bubbles as no pathway existed to extract the gas from the NiFeOx catalyst layer and this is why it displayed a higher overpotential.At around the same time, Tiwari et al. reported a comparison between a 'bubble-free' cell employing Gortex gas diffusion electrodes and conventional, bubble-generating electrolysis cells. They calculated that the contribution of bubble formation to the activation overpotential was ~0. 16 V at 80 o C, excluding the effect of impedance. The energy efficiency decrease caused by bubble formation in conventional, bubble-generating electrolysers was estimated to be \u226511.9% (vs. the Lower Heating Value, LHV, of hydrogen).Most recently, a novel class of 'bubble-free' electrolysis cell, known as a capillary-fed cell, has \nQuestion:\n Which has a lower overpotential at 0.01 A cm-2, the 'breathable' oxygen-evolving anode or the non-porous PE substrate?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The 'breathable' oxygen-evolving anode has a 90 mV lower overpotential at 0.01 A cm-2 compared to the non-porous PE substrate.", "weight": 1}]}

The methodology is widely used for various application such as, sensing , determination of the enantiomeric excess or monitoring the cellular metabolism for example. In this context, large combinatorial libraries with metal salts and indicators can be mixed and screened for a specific detection of analytes of interest. Given the immense possibilities of the strategy, it is obvious that not all reactions are reported in the literature so far. However, their discovery could be useful for various and specific applications and contribute to the general knowledge in chemistry to stimulate the next generations. For example, the simple detection of phosphate over pyrophosphate is still a major challenge given the chemical properties of the first one e.g. large size of the anion, hydrophilicity, multiple protonation states, etc. Areas of science with fundamental problems can be solved with this approach. We, for example, reported chemosensors for the naked-eye detection of phosphate or glyphosate in the past. Even if, indicator displacement assay is more of a procedure practiced for research at universities, it proved to be useful for research at high school too by developing a subcategory in the screening matrix that can be explored.

This dual role of the enzyme in facilitating rapid ligation and overcoming product inhibition suggests that prebiotic replication might have required interactions with surfaces or aqueous complexes that bound the intermediate complex more strongly than the product duplex, thereby facilitating turnover. LIDA involves two coupled cycles initiated by the introduction of a target template (DNA-I) in the presence of an excess of four fragments, two of which (Ia and IbP) constitute the target sequence after their ligation. In the first step, the DNA-I hybridizes with one of two complementary fragments; the hybridization of the 5'-phosphate abasic containing fragment IIaP to the DNA-I is shown in the scheme in Figure . Next, the other fragment IIb hybridizes forming a ternary complex. The T4 DNA ligase present in the solution can ligate the ternary complex to generate the product duplex. Upon spontaneous dissociation of this product duplex, the newly synthesized DNA-II is liberated, which can template the formation of DNA-I through similar steps (Cycle II, Figure ). Using standard conditions, the amount of fluorescent DNA-I formed from the ligation of the Ia and IbP fragments was monitored as a function of time using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) according to our previously reported method. The resulting kinetic profiles represent DNA-I formation versus time for a reaction initiated with 14 nM DNA-I (solid circles, 0.01 equivalents with respect to Ia) and a reaction with no initial DNA-I (open circles, Figure ).

From a steric perspective, the Si1-O-Si bond angle of the least planar porphyrin (1f) is the most acute so one might think the steric interaction is influencing ring structure, however i) this is also the smallest of the studied substituents and arranged in the sterically least impacting way in the solid state (with the phenyl pointing away from the porphyrin) and ii) there is no general correlation between that bond angle and planarity in the studied compounds.There does appear to be a correlation between axial silyloxy substituent size and Si1-O-Si angle, tending towards linear as the cap size increases in this set. The SOPS bearing the largest substituent (OSi t BuPh2, 1h) displays a remarkably wide bond angle of 168\u00b0. The Si1-O bond length also varies based on the silyl cap, though no clear trend is observed. While shorter Si1-O bond distances would be expected in the more planar SOPS, there is a complex interplay amongst these derivatives with respect to the steric and electronic demands of the silyloxy cap substituents. From this perspective the Me2Ph derivative (1f) is unique amongst PorSils that have been examined by X-ray crystallography: it has an Si-X bond distance similar to that of a tetracoordinate silane, yet the porphyrin in the crystal structure is still highly ruffled. The other derivatives seem to fit into the construct derived from previous studies of porphyrin silanes (as discussed above).One last interesting note is that while the silyloxy substituents in 1g, 1h, and 1i are arranged in an anti configuration with respect to the Si-O(-Si1-)O-Si bond, the highly ruffled 1f has a Si-O(-Si1-)O-Si dihedral angle of 86.72\u00b0.

The considered scheme for the removal of the modulator (denoted as M) during such a process is schematized in Figure . The simulation was performed at 110\u00b0C as in agreement with the conditions of activation. Figures show the changes in the distance of zirconium and oxygen atoms during the simulation. Where the zirconium atoms denoted as Zr1 and Zr2 are coordinated to the acetate ion of the framework. According to calculations, the activation process leads to modulator agent removal. Thus, O2 and O8, the oxygen atoms belonging to the acetate ion, move away from Zr1 and Zr2, respectively, leading to bond breaking after 200 fs. It is also observed that the O1 and O7 oxygen atoms belonging to different organic linkers and connected to the Zr1 and Zr2 atoms, respectively, try to separate but at the end of the NVT process, they remained close to the zirconium atoms. Moreover, the activation process was found to promote dehydroxylation. During such dehydroxylation, four water molecules are removed from the zirconium cluster. These results agreed with the experimental evidence collected by TGA and FTIR. To summarize the findings concerning the effect of the concentration of acetic acid on the physicochemical properties of the synthesized Zr-MOFs belonging to the MOF-808 family, the following can be said: (i) organic linkers can be replaced by modulator molecules. The latter can, in turn, be removed from Zr-MOFs during activation during which adsorbed water is also removed.(ii) The thermal stability of the Zr-MOFs was not affected by the modifications in the concentration of the organic modulators.

In fact, the self-replication of nucleic acids remains strongly hindered by product inhibition, even when enzymes are present.Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self-replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved.Previously, our group reported lesion-induced DNA amplification (LIDA), which is an isothermal ligase chain reaction. It was proposed that the lesion, a destabilizing abasic group, played an important role in reducing product inhibition. However, using abasic groups in non-enzymatic ligation cycles did not yield appreciable amplification. In order to identify the unknown factors that overcome product inhibition in LIDA, we have performed a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the process, employing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and global fitting of PAGE fluorescence data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We found that in the absence of an enzyme, the ligated product binds four to five orders of magnitude more tightly to the template than to the shorter unligated strands of the intermediate complex. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase, this stability gap was reduced by two orders of magnitude, such that the intermediate and product complexes were roughly equal in stability. Thus, the ligase helps overcome product inhibition by reducing the affinity difference between the DNA product duplex and the intermediate complex. Furthermore, kinetic simulations showed that the stability of the intermediate complex, as well as the rate constant of ligation, significantly impacts the rate of self-replication, suggesting that catalysts that stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to \nQuestion:\n How does T4 DNA ligase help overcome product inhibition in the process of DNA self-replication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: T4 DNA ligase helps overcome product inhibition by reducing the affinity difference between the DNA product duplex and the intermediate complex.

Repurposing synthesized MOFs for methane to methanol catalysis.The primary factor limiting the application of MOFs in catalysis is their poor stability.Here, we considered a MOF stable and suitable for catalysis if it maintains its structural integrity following solvent removal from its pores during activation, and under elevated temperatures typical in thermal catalysis (e.g., above 200 \u00b0C). We apply artificial neural network (ANN) models developed in prior work that predict the activation and thermal stabilities of a MOF from connectivity-based revised autocorrelations (RACs) and geometric descriptors.

From this set, the activation stability ANN predicts that 69.3% of the featurizable MOFs (6,649 MOFs) are stable upon activation (Figure ). We then label all activation-stable MOFs with their corresponding thermal decomposition temperatures as predicted by the thermal stability ANN and limit our analysis to MOFs containing a single transition-metal element corresponding to Mn, Fe, Co, or Cu, reducing our set to 1,737 MOFs (Figure ).

At above 1.0 A cm -2 , the bubble coverage became excessive, notably decreasing the active surface area of the electrode. Flowing liquid electrolyte over the electrode significantly decreased the bubble coverage with the fractional coverage dependent on the velocity of flow. In early 2019, Li et al. reported a 'breathable' oxygen-evolving anode that was prepared by sputter coating a thin gold layer onto a porous, hydrophobic polyethylene (PE) membrane, followed by electrodepositing a NiFeOx catalyst onto the gold layer. The 'breathable' nature of the electrode derived from the fact that the resulting NiFeOx/Au/PE electrode produced oxygen from water without producing visible gas bubbles at room temperature; the oxygen was drawn, as it was generated, through the porous PE membrane into a gas chamber at its rear. In so doing, the electrode exhibited a 90 mV lower overpotential at 0.01 A cm -2 than when a non-porous PE substrate was used. The non-porous PE substrate forced the formation of oxygen bubbles as no pathway existed to extract the gas from the NiFeOx catalyst layer and this is why it displayed a higher overpotential.At around the same time, Tiwari et al. reported a comparison between a 'bubble-free' cell employing Gortex gas diffusion electrodes and conventional, bubble-generating electrolysis cells. They calculated that the contribution of bubble formation to the activation overpotential was ~0. 16 V at 80 o C, excluding the effect of impedance. The energy efficiency decrease caused by bubble formation in conventional, bubble-generating electrolysers was estimated to be \u226511.9% (vs. the Lower Heating Value, LHV, of hydrogen).Most recently, a novel class of 'bubble-free' electrolysis cell, known as a capillary-fed cell, has \nQuestion:\n Why did the 'breathable' oxygen-evolving anode exhibit a lower overpotential compared to when a non-porous PE substrate was used?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The 'breathable' oxygen-evolving anode exhibited a lower overpotential because it produced oxygen from water without producing visible gas bubbles at room temperature, allowing the oxygen to be drawn through the porous PE membrane into a gas chamber at its rear.

The charge parameters are generally fit to the quantum mechanical electrostatic potential of small molecules. The Lennard-Jones parameters are then fit to reproduce experimental data, such as liquid densities and heats of vaporization. The aim of QUBE is to move away from the requirement for transferable force field parameters, and instead to derive bespoke parameters for molecules directly from QM calculations. First, a QM simulation of the molecule under study is performed. From the output of the QM calculation, the total electron density of the molecule is partitioned onto individual atoms using an atoms-in-molecule (AIM) weighting scheme. There is no unique method to perform this partitioning, but we favor the density derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) scheme, which is a weighted combination of the iterative stockholder atoms and iterative Hirshfeld approaches. With the electron density partitioned to individual atoms, the atom-centered charges can be simply found by integrating the electron density over all space (and adding the nuclear charge). We have implemented the DDEC approach in the ONETEP software package, which allows us to perform QM calculations of, and assign parameters to, systems comprising thousands of atoms.

From the singlet states, most population is then transferred to the 3 T 2 states, while only a small amount of ca. 1% survives for long simulation times in the singlet states.From the 3 T 2 states, the population then relaxes back to the 3 T 1 ground states.We had previously discussed the possible influence of using CASPT2 to parametrize the LVC potentials in the Supporting Information of Ref. 1. There, we argued that using CASPT2 in place of CASSCF energies would lead to three differences. First, the 3 T 1 \u2032 --\u2192 3 A 2 internal conversion would be partially quenched through shifting of 3 A 2 energies. This hypothesis is realized in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics, that now show only 50% of the population moving via the 3 T 1 \u2032 --\u2192 3 A 2 pathway compared to the 70% of the CASSCF dynamics. Second, the long-lived singlet population would increase through partial quenching of the Sing --\u2192 3 T 2 back-intersystem crossing. This second hypothesis is also realized in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics The CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics thereby not only show a larger total retention of singlet population at extended simulation times, i.e., 9% in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics vs. 1% in the CASSCF dynamics. The CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics also show a larger relative retention, as the singlet population falls from the maximum of 43% to 9%, i.e,. to ca. a fifth of its maximum value, while it falls from 10% to 1%, i.e., a tenth of its maximum value in the CASSCF dynamics. Third, we argued that due to the stabilization of the 3 T 1 \u2032 states, they may receive more population during the dynamics which in turn could lead to larger population transfer to the singlet states. While the first part of this hypothesis has not been proven fulfilled, i.e., there is not more population channel through the 3 T 1 \u2032 states in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics compared to the CASSCF dynamics, we find indeed larger \nQuestion:\n Why does using CASPT2 instead of CASSCF in parametrizing LVC potentials lead to a larger retention and relative retention of the singlet population?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Using CASPT2 in place of CASSCF energies leads to a larger total retention of singlet population at extended simulation times, specifically 9% in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics versus 1% in the CASSCF dynamics.

Alkaline electrolyzers have been in use since the space age (where their main use was to electrolyze water to produce O2 for the astronauts) and they are a well-developed technology. \u2022 PEM electrolysisthe charge carrier is H + . It has been developed in the past few decades using the existing knowledge from PEM fuel cells (as they share the same ion-conducting polymer membrane). PEM electrolyzers use PGM (Platinum Group Metals) as catalysts. This means that their widespread adoption could burden the supply chain of some components. However, they have an advantage over alkaline electrolyzers in their ability to quickly ramp-up and rampdown to cope with the intermittency of renewable energy systems (RES). Thus, PEM electrolyzers are more suitable for direct connection to renewable electricity than alkaline electrolyzers. This eliminates the need to rely on the existing electricity transport infrastructure. \u2022 SO (Solid Oxide) electrolysisthe charge carrier is O 2-. This is a relatively recent development that incorporates progress achieved in the SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) industry. Whereas both alkaline and PEM electrolyzers operate at near-ambient conditions, SO electrolyzers operate at temperatures above 700 o C, which implies that they are less suitable for dynamic operation. Furthermore, SO electrolyzers are at an earlier stage of development due in part to a similar status of SOFC technologies.A common challenge for all types of devices described above, is the current lack of large-scale manufacture of electrolyzers, compared to the current ambitions and targets towards 2030 and beyond.As of 2020, the total worldwide electrolyzer manufacturing capacity was 20 MW/year (Figure ), mostly \nQuestion:\n Which type of electrolyzer, SO or alkaline, is less suitable for dynamic operation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: SO electrolyzers are less suitable for dynamic operation compared to alkaline electrolyzers.", "weight": 1}]}

Both works showed that few geometric descriptors related to the backbone of the protein afford with convenient information to predict metalbinding sites rather than focusing only on the first coordination sphere donors (mainly side chains) that coordinate the metal.BioMetAll represents a major step forward in how to predict metal-binding sites in proteins. The approach stands on the geometric information extracted from a collection of about 171000 biological complexes to infer a combination of geometric rules that are used to evaluate the regions of a protein for metal binding. The program accurately reproduces the experimental metal-binding motifs on a benchmark of 53 structures. Furthermore, we present three specific case studies to illustrate its potential. BioMetAll is efficient to i) predict metal-binding sites with particular amino acid motifs even for non-canonical metal coordinating amino acids and backbone atoms; ii) determine transient metal-binding sites in structures that need conformational changes to reach the complete coordination sphere, which could be related to metal diffusion pathways; and even iii) predict potential mutations of an existing protein to generate convenient metal-binding sites.

Multiple forms of regulated cell death that are executed by distinct pathways have recently been characterized. A fundamental phenotypic difference between them and apoptosis is the permeabilization of the cellular membranes early on in the process which causes an inflammatory phenotype. Necroptosis is one of these inflammatory programmed cell death pathways and is dependent on the activity of receptor interacting protein kinase 1, 3 (RIPK1, RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase like protein (MLKL) phosphorylation when caspase activity is reduced. Necroptosis exhibits phenotypic hallmarks of necrosis including cellular swelling, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and the release of intracellular content. Closely linked to this membrane permeabilization and associated inflammatory response, necroptotic cell death has been observed in many diseases, including ischemia/reperfusion injuries and myocardial infarction .MLKL oligomerization and translocation to the plasma membrane is required for necroptosis . MLKL consists of a C-terminal kinase-like domain that interacts with RIPK3, which results in its phosphorylation . This phosphorylation triggers the oligomerization and translocation of pMLKL to the plasma membrane. The membrane recruitment of the oligomer is mediated by electrostatic interactions between positively charged regions of pMLKL \nQuestion:\n Why does necroptosis lead to an inflammatory phenotype?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Necroptosis leads to an inflammatory phenotype due to the permeabilization of the cellular membranes early in the process, which is a fundamental phenotypic difference from apoptosis.", "weight": 1}]}

The twin operation about uvw = [100] or the symmetry equivalent vector hkl = (001) is probably the consequence of such faults. The routine ADDSYM in the PLATON software detects an 85% fit for the transformation of the current structure into the centrosymmetric space group P 2 1 /n. As expected, the deviating atoms are the asymmetric carbons C1x and C2x (x=1,2). Additionaly, the ring carbons C4x and C5x also do not fit.

Much lower activation energies obtained in case of light-induced compared to the thermal reaction is indicative different pathways followed by the system under these conditions. These observations are consistent with the idea that for the reaction under study, plasmon-driven reactions are assisted by the hot carriers which leads to an reduced activation barrier, a pathway which is different from the thermally driven reaction under dark conditions. Finally, we believe that the measurement strategy presented in this work based on determining kinetic and thermodynamic parameters using a closed system is robust and widely applicable as it can be extended to different plasmon-driven chemical reactions. This will greatly contribute to our understanding of thermal vs non-thermal effects and mechanistic aspects of plasmon-induced chemistry in general.

RAS-SF wave functionA RAS-SF calculation starts from high-spin, restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) reference orbitals, from which target states of interest are computed by via SF excitations. The RAS scheme divides the orbitals into three subspaces labeled RAS1, RAS2, and RAS3 and the wave function ansatz for RAS-SF is|\u03a8 = m\u2208RAS2 c m |\u03c6 m + h\u2208RAS1 m\u2208RAS2 c h m |\u03c6 h m + p\u2208RAS3 m\u2208RAS2 c p m |\u03c6 p m .(1)The RAS2 space is the active space and should include the most important orbitals needed to describe the electronic states of interest; the m \u2208 RAS2 in Eq. ( ) includes all configurations within the active space, meaning that RAS-SF resembles a CAS-CI method within the RAS2 space. The RAS1 space contains all doublyoccupied orbitals and RAS3 contains virtual orbitals, and we allow single excitations between these two subspaces and RAS2, corresponding to holes h \u2208 RAS1 and particles p \u2208 RAS3. This particular ansatz has been called RAS(h,p)-SF. To describe CT states, 11 the high-spin reference orbitals are first localized onto molecular fragments, where they are then categorized by subspace (RAS1, RAS2, or RAS3) and by fragment. The RAS Hamiltonian is then partitioned into CT and non-CT blocks, where the latter will also be called the \"locally-excited\" (LE) block. Diagonalization of these blocks provides either the LE states or the CT states, and the latter are further grouped into left-right versus right-left character, or equivalently A \u2192 B versus B \u2192 A (Fig. ). \nQuestion:\n What is the step after 'starts from high-spin ROHF reference orbitals' in the process of RAS-SF calculation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Localizes high-spin reference orbitals onto molecular fragments.", "weight": 1}]}

The substrate specificity of ZDHHCs are also greatly impacted by the cellular (co)localization with substrates at the plasmalemma, ER, Golgi or endosomal membranes. Based on the spatial organization of ZDHHCs, these enzymes acylate a variety of target proteins and regulate their targeting to distinct cellular membranes. Many members of the ZDHHC S-acyltransferases reside at the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and ZDHHC5 is one of the few members of the family that is localized to the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments. Studies have shown that the acylation of target proteins by ZDHH5 takes place at the plasma membrane and retains them at this location, controlling their subcellular localization. ZDHHC5 is also involved in regulation of the localization of endocytosis-related proteins that have been linked to MLKL recycling. Based on these observations and the fact that pMLKL acylation occurs downstream to its oligomerization, potentially at the plasma membrane, we focused on investigating ZDHHC5 as a potential acyltransferase that might be responsible for the incorporation of MLKL/pMLKL.

Additionally, a maximum T 1 yield of only 1.25% is observed, because most of the triplets formed rapidly undergo triplet fusion. A significant amount of excimer formation is predicted by the Dover model at 8 mM (34%), but, as discussed previously, the TA data fits well to just two components (S 1 and T 1 ) without additional absorption or emission that could be due to excimers. It is possible that the spectral component we assign to T 1 could instead be due to excimers, but, as we show in Fig. of the supplementary material, the spectral shape is consistent with previously assigned T 1 basis spectra. Additionally, the excimer state is emissive, but there is an absence of any obvious emission features in the basis spectrum that correspond to the excimer emission characterized by Dover et al.. Instead, we attribute the discrepancy between the Dover model and the TA data in this study to the concentrations of TIPS-Tn used. Both Dover et al. and Stern et al. used concentrations of 300 mM, 37.5 times higher than the 8 mM samples used here. We observed that agitation is required to dissolve 8 mM solutions of TIPS-Tn in toluene, and therefore propose that at a concentration of 300 mM TIPS-Tn may only be partially soluble, and consequently that aggregation may begin to occur at that concentration.Excimer formation may be facilitated by these aggregates, and is therefore absent at more dilute concentrations. Aggregate formation would explain why the decay of the S 1 state at 8 mM is overestimated by the Dover model. If SF or excimer formation were due to aggregates rather than, or in addition to, collisions between molecules, then the pseudo-first-order SF rate constants at 300 mM would not scale linearly with concentration, and the bimolecular rate constant would no longer be applicable.

It is then, that theoretical investigations become invaluable as they offer an alternative access to study and predict the properties of photoactive compounds.In the most simple approach, the photoreactivity of compounds can be studied by performing static calculations of characteristic points on the potential energy surfaces of the electronic states such as potential energy minima or crossing points of different electronic states. In this way, static investigations can often establish heuristic models of photoreactions. Equipped with modern computational resources and efficient quantum chemistry programs, such approaches have become affordable to allow even screening of large libraries of photoactive compounds, albeit somewhat restricted to the usage of low-cost black-box electronic structure methods. Beyond the heuristic models, more insight into the mechanisms of photoreactions can be gained by simulating their dynamics explicitly.

Of these detected spins, the pump pulse would invert one third of their coupled partners, and so one ninth of the molecules in the sample would contribute an oscillatory component to the recorded trace.

Among the plethora of ligands used in transition metal catalysis phosphines have been demonstrated to be an invaluable ligand class in a variety of transformations. Buchwald and co -workers have developed the so-called Buchwaldtype phosphines, which have been shown to occupy two coordination sites in low -valent Pd-complexes (Figure ). In addition to the P-Pd interaction an \u03b7 1 -Pd-Cipso bonding interaction was found in the complex LPd(dba) (L = 2 -(2\u00b4,6\u00b4dimethoxybiphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine; dba = dibenzylidene-acetone). The 2-biphenyl moiety in this ligand class has allowed to achieve the challenging coupling of aryl chlorides and extremel y hindered aryl boronic acids in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Since their initial synthesis various Buchwald-type phosphines have been presented and are now comm ercially available (e.g. JohnPhos). In order to access the electronic properties of phosphines usually Tolman's cone angle and/or electronic parameter (TPE) are utilized, allowing to measure direct ligand metal interactions. In contrast to Pd-catalysis (with mostly square planar complexes), in gold(I)-catalysis the linear coordination mode at gold is operational. This forces substrates into trans-position of the ligand, which enhances its electronic effects. Cationic gold complexes are well suited for the electrophilic activation of alkynes and their subsequent \nQuestion:\n How does the coordination mode of Pd-catalysis compare to that of gold(I)-catalysis?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Pd-catalysis typically involves square planar complexes, whereas gold(I)-catalysis operates with a linear coordination mode.", "weight": 1}]}

Standard electronic structure methods based on the hierarchical improvements of the single-determinantal Hartree-Fock wavefunction fail to accurately describe electronic structure of diradicals and system with more unpaired electrons. An elegant and robust solution to this problem is afforded by the equationof-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) methods capable of describing multiconfigurational wave functions in a single-reference framework .Different variants of EOM-CC provide access to different types of target states and different degeneracy patterns. For example, the manifold of low-lying diradical and triradical states can be accessed by the EOM-SF ansatz . The EOM-SF approach describes the target singlet and triplet (M s = 0) states by spin-flipping excitations from the high-spin triplet (M s = 1) reference state in which the two (near)-degenerate frontier orbitals are singly occupied (Figure ). The configurations involving single excitations within the singly occupied orbital space form a spin-complete set (the first four configurations in the top panel in Fig. ), but the single excitations from the singly occupied to virtual space (configurations 5 and 6 in the top panel) lack their spin counterparts, which only appear at the doubly excited level (configurations 7 and 8). The unbalanced treatment of these configurations (5/6 and 7/8) results in spin contamination and deteriorated accuracy.

By this metric, the pseudo-fidelity of the fitted state (Figure and 8b, green) to the desired state (black) is 0.788. Note that the fitted experimental state was normalised by the magnitude of the calculated expectation values because the experimental starting state is unknown. This means that the measurement is insensitive to an overall loss in magnetisation, and therefore this measurement of this pseudo-fidelity is a normalised pseudo-fidelity and an upper-bound (see further discussion later in the 'Relation to experiment' section). Factors leading the loss of fidelity are examined further in Section 4, however while discussing the fitted expectation values it is pertinent to note that due to the relatively low value found for the filter pulse flip probability, the majority of the echo intensity in all traces arises from 'leakage' of unfiltered magnetisation. If the actual filter pulse efficiency is greater than the value used in the fit, then the expectation values of observables which are not single-quantum coherences will be artificially inflated as these operators cannot be detected without being affected by a filter pulse. This will be especially problematic for experiments with filter pulses at both frequencies, in which less than 20% of the fitted signal arises from the desired coherence pathway.

Obviously, like for other techniques based on empirical scores, the predictiveness of the method cannot be limited to the best solution only and those secondary metal binding sites that BioMetAll detects are not necessarily false positives but transient metallic environments accessible to the protein (see our first application case on HSA). Energetic terms and other physico-chemical magnitudes that are not present in BioMetAll, could dictate the fine structure of the metal-binding site. Posterior filtering could be necessary depending on the objective of its use.The accuracy of the predicted binding area was further assessed by measuring the distance from the experimental metal position to the nearest computed probe. On average a difference between calculated and experimental positions of the metal is about 0.56 \u00b1 0.19 \u00c5. Importantly, such quality is not influenced by the presence of donors coordinated to the metal provided by exogenous compounds (e.g. phosphate or water molecules). In these cases, we generally observe a displacement to the limits of the predicted region (Figure ), suggesting that the exogenous donors only slightly modify the position of the metal and the organization of the side chains.Because calculations are performed in a blind manner, meaning that all the system is screened for predicting metal-binding sites, these results are quite remarkable.

Only single quantum coherences can be directly detected in magnetic resonance echo experiments, and so the remaining operators must be converted to a detectable form in order to measure their expectation values. A general protocol for performing quantum state tomography on an \ud835\udc5bqubit system by NMR consists of a series of experiments in which one of three operations is applied to each spin prior to detection of the FID signal. The choices of operations are: i. do nothing, or apply a 90\u00b0 'filter' pulse along ii. +\ud835\udc65 or iii. +\ud835\udc66, which we will denote 1, X, and Y, respectively. In a two-qubit system there are nine possible pairs of operations, and any Cartesian operator can be converted into a detectable single-quantum in-or anti-phase coherence by at least one combination (Table ). While it is possible to measure all operators with just four combinations it is common practice to perform all nine experiments to allow for repeated observations. This protocol relies on the ability to measure both in-and anti-phase coherences. However the ensemble broadening of EPR spectra precludes the direct detection of anti-phase coherences in the weak inter-spin coupling regime that we consider here. As a result, to transfer this procedure from NMR to EPR it is necessary to devise a detection sequence capable of measuring the expectation values of anti-phase coherences.

For example, quenching values for triethylamine shows no clear correlation between Ksv and excited state oxidation potential (Figure ). Other phenomena such as pH, binding events, exciplex formation or hydrogen bonding have been shown to influence quenching. Solvent effects also have a role, as illustrated by the 1.7 fold higher Ksv between Ir(ppy)3 and diethylbromomalonitrile in acetonitrile compared to that in DCE.

Hence, the chemical space by 1869 made most of the elements to be dissimilar from each other. In such a space of tiny similarities, chemists, nevertheless, were able to recognise several of them. Was it the result of chemical genius? Or a consequence of the organogenic bias of the space?To assess whether deep knowledge of the space was needed to gauge simi-larities among elements, or, on the contrary, whether partial knowledge sufficed to detect similarities, we took random samples of the formulae in the space of different sizes and analysed how often the similarities given by the whole formulae in the space (Figure ) were present in the samples (Methods). After analysing the 9,752 formulae spanning the space, we found that there are stable similarities, still evident in tiny portions of the space, e.g. Br\u2192Cl, Na\u2192K, O\u2192S, Cl\u2192Br, S\u2192O, K\u2192Na, Se\u2192S, As\u2192P (shown at the top of Figure ).

Their applications are often hindered, however, by poor solubilities that result from their extended, solvophobic aromatic surfaces. Attempts to counteract this problem by functionalizing their peripheries have been met with only limited success. Here, we demonstrate a versatile strategy to tune the physical and electronic properties of porphyrins using an axial functionalization approach. Porphyrin silanes (PorSils) and bissilyloxy PorSils (SOPS) are prepared from porphyrins by operationally simple \u03ba 4 N-silylation protocols, introducing bulky silyloxy \"caps\" that are central and perpendicular to the planar porphyrin. While porphyrins typically form either J-or H-aggregates, SOPS do not self-associate in the same manner: the silyloxy axial substituents dramatically improve solubility by inhibiting aggregation. Moreover, axial porphyrin functionalization offers convenient handles through which optical, electronic, and structural properties of the porphyrin core can be modulated. We observe that the identity of the silyloxy substituent impacts the degree of planarity of the porphyrin in the solid state as well as the redox potentials. \nQuestion:\n How does the aggregation behavior of SOPS compare to that of typical porphyrins?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: SOPS do not self-associate in the same manner as typical porphyrins; the silyloxy axial substituents in SOPS inhibit aggregation, improving solubility.", "weight": 1}]}

While each orientation of the molecule is equally likely to be present in the sample, leading to a Pake pattern of inter-spin coupling frequencies, the orientations do not contribute equally to the recorded data due to the inherent orientation selectivity of microwave pulses (Figure ). As such we can generate two models of dipolar coupling: one with uniform weights representing the sample as a whole, and one in which each orientation is weighted by the overlap of the nitroxide spectrum with the microwave pulses. The simulated fidelities of the entangling gate with \ud835\udf14 C = 2 MHz for the uniform and weighted models are 0.749 and 0.821, respectively, significantly lower than the corresponding simulations considering an isotropic interaction. This decrease in fidelity is caused by interference between systems with different coupling frequencies, which diminishes the expectation values of the anti-phase coherences. The uniformly weighted simulation is more impacted by this interference as its frequency distribution is a complete Pake pattern, whereas the frequency distribution of the spectrally weighted simulation corresponds to a partial Pake pattern.In addition to the orientational disorder, molecules in frozen solution will adopt different conformations with different inter-spin distances.

In particular, three heavy industries, i.e. chemicals (production of primary chemicals i.e., ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, ammonia, and methanol), steel, and cement, account for nearly 60% of all energy consumption and about 72% of all the industrial CO2 emissions. Electrifying industry has been a viable option for years, but it has two challenges. Firstly, the cost of electricity per unit energy (MWh) is higher than fossil fuels, making it less appealing for businesses. Secondly, industrialized countries such as Germany, Poland, the US, and the Netherlands produce electricity with high carbon intensity (>300 g CO2/kWh) , making electrification ineffective in reducing industry's carbon footprint.In densely populated countries like the Netherlands, the electricity grid is near its maximum transport capacity, causing congestion problems. Large off-takers and electricity producers joining the network without a planned expansion worsen the situation. Hence, hydrogen is seen as a potential substitute for electrification. In industry, there are two primary methods for utilizing hydrogen. The first is to generate heat, primarily high-temperature heat. The second is to use it as a chemical reagent in processes such as the Haber-Bosch process for obtaining ammonia.If heat is the main input needed by a particular industry, then in principle hydrogen can directly substitute fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal.

To promote the film adhesion, we utilize a surface treatment approach to activate hydrophilic groups on the substrates. By treating our substrates with UV-Ozone exposure, effective anchoring of the metal nodes could be achieved. This labile treatment allowed us to demonstrate a greener and simpler route (as opposed to the commonly used piranha solution treatment which is only limited to electrodes based on precious inert metals, e.g. Au,) for growing Cu-HHTP films (~10 nm per cycle) onto pre-patterned areas to fabricate desired chemiresistive sensor devices (Fig. ). For the current study, we use commercially-available patterned ITO substrates to fabricate our sensing devices. A ligand exchange reaction could then be performed to synthesize the MOF on the substrate's surface. A continuous and uniform film was formed when the cleaned and activated substrates were alternatively immersed in solutions of copper acetate (metal source) and the hexadroxytriphenylene (ligand) as shown in Figure . In contrast to previous reports where the film growth takes more than 1 hour per cycle, we opted to increase the concentration of both the metal source and the ligand, and we were able to halve the growth times After only 4 cycles (i.e. 2 hours), a continuous light-blue film could be observed by naked eye as shown in Figure .

Importantly, these same methods predicted the phase change \uf044H for both the Fe and Cu variants with remarkable accuracy as compared with experimental calorimetry. Together, these results suggest that if a MOF has the potential for a phase change due to electronic aspects specific to the metal ion, the dynamic ML bonding intrinsic to MOFs serve as the soft mode. For example, in the case of SCO, where ML bonds transition from short and strong low-spin states to long and weak high-spin bonds, the \"tight\"-\"loose\" equilibrium is well suited to shuttle the material from one phase to the other. Dynamic ML bonds also affect the electronic structures of MOFs by perturbing the ligand field of the metal sites. Early evidence of this effect was observed by VT diffuse-reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy (VT-DRUVVis) of MUV-10(Ca), Ti3Ca3(\u03bc3-O)2(1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate)4(H2O)6. Upon heating the material, absorption tails emerged as far as 2.0 eV below the low-temperature optical gap. Despite such a large effect, these tails disappeared upon cooling, thereby ruling out irreversible thermal degradation. Instead, the absorption tailing suggests reversible structural distortions around the MOF nodes that dynamically lower the symmetry of the metal sites, creating mid-gap states. Analogously, vibronic coupling dynamically lowers the symmetry of molecular inorganic complexes. As a result, they display colour from formally forbidden optical transitions. Guest molecules also influence the dynamic equilibria of MOF ML bonding.

Here, a rather well studied class of reactions is the adsorption of n-alkanes onto zeolites. As an example the adsorption entropy of n-butane, n-pentane, and n-hexane (Fig. ) in a H-ZSM-5 zeolit cut-out was calculated with GFN-FF. For a given zeolit structure cut-out (e.g., obtained from a crystal structure and saturated with hydrogen atoms) thermodynamic properties can be obtained with the (ms)RRHO approach.Sampling of the configurations in CREST then simply requires some additional geometrical constraints, as was discussed in previous work. This is necessary because the zeolit chunk shall mimic a solid and its structure would be strongly deformed or even broken by the metadynamic simulations and geometry optimizations at GFN level.

However, the resemblance of the SOMO to a d z 2 function is misleading, and is a consequence of the spherical form of s functions and the small contributions from individual ligand atoms (none larger than 2%, however their sum accounts for ca. 42% of the SOMO).Our CASSCF calculations show that the first excited state is only ca. 9000 cm -1 above the ground state, and that it can be described as a metal-to-ligand charge transfer state with the unpaired electron occupying an unusually diffuse ligand orbital (largest Y contribution is 3% 4d, with 89% deriving from ligand functions; Fig. and Table ). There are seven excited states less than 20,000 cm -1 above the ground state, all having the unpaired electron in very diffuse ligand based orbitals (Figs. S37 -S43and Tables ). This indicates that the electron is easily delocalized across the molecule, and explains why the SOMO cannot be simply described as either a 4d z 2 or 5s function on Y. Indeed, it is not until the eighth and ninth excited states (at ca. 34,000 cm -1 ) that we find other metal-dominated MOs, which correspond mainly to the Y-based 4d xz and 4d yz functions (Figs. S44 and S45, Tables and). The large energy gap to the 4d excited orbitals quenches the orbital angular momentum and this leads to the small g-anisotropy of the ground state. The same conclusions hold for an optimised structure of the anion in 1 (see Supplementary Information).

When using redundant internal coordinates or when optimizing a system with constraints, our algorithm uses a variety of projected internal coordinate bases as well.This section outlines how these projected bases are constructed and the relationships between them.The Cartesian coordinate vector of a molecule is represented by the 3n-dimensional vector x, where n is the number of atoms in the molecule. The redundant internal coordinate vector is represented by the m-dimensional vector q, where m \u2265 3n -6.Each element of q corresponds to one of the internal coordinates determined by the algorithm described in appendix A, and m is the total number of internal coordinates that have been determined. In practice, only the Cartesian coordinate vector x behaves as an independent variable for the optimization algorithm, and the internal coordinate vector q is calculated from x. Therefore, all changes to the internal coordinate vector q are realized as changes to x; this has important implications for the iterative diagonalization algorithm described in section 2.3 and the constrained saddle point optimization algorithm described in section 2.4 below. In this work, all undecorated vector and matrix quantities are defined to be in a basis of redundant internal coordinates with the exception of the Cartesian coordinate vector x. Quantities in other coordinate systems will be decorated with an accent character, as described below.In addition to the Cartesian and redundant internal coordinate bases, our algorithm also uses a nonredundant basis which is a linear combination of the redundant internal coordinates. <ref \nQuestion:\n How does the dimensionality of the redundant internal coordinate vector compare to that of the Cartesian coordinate vector for a molecule?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The dimensionality of the redundant internal coordinate vector is greater than or equal to the Cartesian coordinate vector minus six.", "weight": 1}]}

The energy released by the impingement is dissipated within approximately one turnover time of the largest eddies. As a result, micromixing was studied using a simple model that assumes diffusion of species in slabs of fixed thickness (2\ud835\udc3f), which are generated within the impingement zone. The experimental study followed the progress of an acid-base neutralization containing a fluorophore. A simulation, which included a module for calculating the fluorescence, determined 2\ud835\udc3f for experimental energy dissipation rates (\ud835\udf16) ranging from 5x10 3 to 7.7x10 6 W/kg. 2\ud835\udc3f was found to lie in the range of turbulence dissipative scales less than the Taylor microscale but greater than the Kolmogorov microscale (\ud835\udf02).

In this context, linkers are defined as polydentate organic ligands which interconnect the inorganic nodes. MOFs contain voids accessible for various probe molecules that can be used for many applications. Due to this modular design, there are almost no limits regarding structural nodes combination, resulting in a wide variety of frameworks with different topologies. In addition to excellent tunability of the material properties, MOFs often show immense surface areas with permanent porosity. A limited number of MOFs show also structural flexibility, reflected in a distinct structural response to external stimuli which can be considered among the most unique and fascinating properties compared to traditional porous solids. The phenomenon was first predicted in 1998 as an attribute of the third generation of MOFs, which are also known as flexible MOFs or soft porous crystals. Dynamic behavior of soft porous crystals could be exploited in the last decades in a range of different applications like gas separation , molecular sensing , drug delivery <ref type=\"bibr\" \nQuestion:\n Why do MOFs often show immense surface areas with permanent porosity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: MOFs often show immense surface areas with permanent porosity due to their highly porous coordination networks, which consist of inorganic nodes and linker molecules.", "weight": 1}]}

There are several dipeptides which show populations of left-handed \u03b1-helical conformation. High left-handed helical populations have previously caused problems for other force fields. However, since the occupancy of PPII and \u03b2 regions always remain higher than the the populations of the left-handed \u03b1-helical region, reducing the left-handed helical population was not considered a priority in this work. The right-handed \u03b1-helical populations are small for all the dipeptides. This is in agreement with experimental results.

In particular, megaTYR was selected because several previous studies showed that the enzyme tolerated point mutations while retaining high activity to free tyrosine. The published crystal structures for megaTYR were beneficial for protein engineering, as they allowed rational design of point mutants and facilitated computational analysis of the protein (Figure ). In addition, cnkTYR was recently shown to have excellent monophenol monooxygenase activity and to tolerate low temperatures without significant loss in catalytic efficiency. In addition to the previously published work on protein L, the motivation for these explorations was the realization that abTYR was incapable of activating phenols attached to a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrate. In contrast, our first experiment with megaTYR showed significant levels of coupling between GFP and the phenol-DNA (Figure ). This reaction occurs as two distinct steps: the initial activation of the phenol to the orthoquinone followed by addition of the nucleophile. These results suggested that some aspect of the DNA substrate was preventing activation by abTYR but was tolerated by megaTYR (Figure ).

RamanSPy is designed to systematise day-to-day workflows, enhance algorithmic development and validation, and accelerate the adoption of novel AI technologies into the RS field. Firstly, RamanSPy serves as a platform for general-purpose RS analytics supporting the RS data life cycle by providing a suite of ready-to-use modules for data loading, preprocessing, analysis and visualisation. By design, these functionalities are not tied to any specific technology or data type, thereby allowing integrative and transferable Fig. General Raman spectroscopy workflow and core features of RamanSPy . a, RamanSPy supports the Raman spectroscopic data analysis life cycle via a modular, loosely coupled architecture.

The development of gas transport infrastructure was historically done in view of two types of gas to deliver: 1) the transport of 'town gas' i.e., gasified coal that consists of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in urban settlements, and 2) the natural gas (either low caloric or high caloric) that holds little to no hydrogen. As such, it is not expected that hydrogen would be compatible with the existing assets in the natural gas transport infrastructure, in particular looking at the transmission grid (in many countries it consists of large-diameter pipelines with a nominal operating pressure upwards of 50 bar) and being mindful of pressure-induced phenomena such as permeation, leaks, or hydrogeninduced embrittlement.There are several past and ongoing projects to prove the extent to which the assets of the natural gas infrastructure can be reused for hydrogen or hydrogen blends and to which extent they would need to be replaced or maintained more often (both of which would result in increased hydrogen transport costs). Research in this topic has converged so far to the knowledge that the existing natural gas infrastructure can carry hydrogen blends up to 20-30% without serious modifications, while blending higher hydrogen percentages as well as carrying 100% hydrogen need more research. \nQuestion:\n Why is it challenging to blend hydrogen with natural gas in the existing natural gas infrastructure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Blending hydrogen with natural gas presents challenges due to the increased flammability of the mixture and the compatibility issues with the existing natural gas infrastructure, which was not originally designed to handle hydrogen.

Pyrene-based materials have found application in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs). One of the most important driving forces enabling the use of pyrene over a wide range of applications is the possible functionalization of its molecular backbone. Accordingly, previous research in the field has focused on modifying the properties of pyrene by introducing substituents at the periphery of the molecule or by incorporating pyrene units into semiconducting polymers. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the \uf070-electron system on the properties of pyrene has not yet been addressed.During the past years, the importance of topology for the molecular properties of organic semiconductors has been increasingly recognized. The inherent promise for performance improvements resulted in a revived interest in nonalternant \uf070-electron systems and first efforts to use the related molecules in (opto)electronic devices have been made. However, most of the related studies focus on azulene and its derivatives.

Using photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and other methods, it is shown that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of pyrene. The difference of the optical band gaps is even larger with 1.09 eV, as determined by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. The nonalternant nature of azupyrene is also associated with a more localized charge distribution, as can be seen in 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance shifts, as well as the C1s core-level shifts. Further insight is provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the molecular properties and ab initio coupled cluster calculations of the optical transitions.

However, Guthries benchmark set is mainly composed from rather rigid structures for which the S RRHO entropy is already quite accurate.For both B97-3c and B3LYP, deviations between the calculated S msRRHO (or S RRHO values, data not shown) and the experimental value increase with the size and flexibility of the molecule. Only by including the conformational contributions it is possible to reach chemical accuracy. Overall, the different method combinations show fairly similar performance, although some trends can be recognized. A good performance of B3LYP is unsurprising as it is well known to be among the best performing DFT functionals for the calculation of vibrational properties and was basically constructed for this purpose. Although the (computationally cheaper) B97-3c method performs slightly better than B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP, this is sensitive to the choice of \u03c4 and \u03bd scal and furthermore depends on the technical settings of the DFT calculations, like the choice of the grid or SCF convergence thresholds. Therefore, a clear preference for one out of the two tested methods is difficult to draw.The same is true when comparing the two assessed methods for calculating S conf . S conf strongly depends on the shape of the PES which can be rather different between a force field and a quantum chemical method. Since GFN2-xTB has the more physically reasonable PES of the two methods, usually a better performance should be expected. However, GFN-FF seemingly outperforms GFN2-xTB in combination with both B97-3c and B3LYP but this is mainly due to the removal of three strong outliers (3,3-dimethylpentane, 3,3-diethyl-2methylpentane and perfluorheptane) that were discarded from the GFN-FF error statistics.For all three molecules GFN-FF produces some artificially low-lying \nQuestion:\n Why does the performance of the B97-3c method slightly outperform B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The performance of the B97-3c method slightly outperforms B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP mainly because it is sensitive to the choice of \u03c4 and \u03bd scal and depends on the technical settings of the DFT calculations, such as the choice of the grid or SCF convergence thresholds.", "weight": 1}]}

Indeed, sequence-based ones would not consider such modification of the protein structure. To ascertain the discriminative capabilities of BioMetAll, both fatted (HSA f ) and defatted (HSA d ) X-Ray structures of HSA (PDB codes 1bj5 and 5ijf, respectively) were probed for zones containing a minimum of three coordinator amino acids, whose types should be a combination of His, Asp and Glu. Those are amino acids which side chains are those with the highest affinity toward Zn 2+ . A second prediction was performed with a more specific motif similar to the MBS site: two histidine residues and either an aspartate or a glutamate.As a result of the first analysis, both known primary binding sites (MBS and NTS) were detected by BioMetAll for HSA d with His-His-Asp/Glu along with other secondary sites that satisfy patterns like NHis/COO -Asp/Glu;COO -Glu;COO -Asp/Glu (Table ) and that have also been reported in the literature. However, for HSA f , only the NTS (His3-His9-Glu6) together with the same secondary sites than HSA d are identified (Table ). By looking for the specific motif His-His-Asp/Glu, the MBS and NTS sites were uniquely identified for HSA d (Figure ) while only the NTS binding site was detected for HSA f (Figure ). Hence, BioMetAll differentiates the metal-binding profile between both conformational states of HSA. This case study points out that BioMetall is not only able to predict with accuracy primary and secondary metal-binding sites but also to account for the impact of conformational changes of the protein and how it affects its preorganization for metal binding. \nQuestion:\n Why does BioMetAll differentiate the metal-binding profile between both conformational states of HSA?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: BioMetAll differentiates the metal-binding profile between both conformational states of HSA because it is able to account for the impact of conformational changes of the protein and how it affects its preorganization for metal binding.", "weight": 1}]}

Violet light irradiation, typically at 394 nm, isomerizes azoMTX from the E isomer to the Z isomer, whereas green light, typically at 560 nm, induces reverse isomerization from Z to E. Since (Z)-azoMTX has a higher affinity to eDHFR than the E isomer, azoMTX was associated with and dissociated from eDHFR repeatedly by alternating irradiation with different wavelengths of light. Accordingly, we designed a small-molecule dimerizer pcDH (Fig. ), which involves both an azoMTX-based photochromic eDHFR ligand and HaloTag ligand, to establish a photochromic CID system. One of the carboxy groups of azoMTX was removed for the design of pcDH to enhance its cell membrane permeability. Since the HaloTag ligand, a chloroalkyl group, specifically forms a covalent bond with a HaloTag protein (33 kDa) , pcDH is spontaneously labeled with HaloTag-fused proteins in living cells. Under dark conditions, binding to eDHFR can be suppressed because the thermally stable E form of the photochromic ligand shows a low affinity to eDHFR. UV to violet light irradiation isomerizes the photochromic ligand and enhances the affinity to eDHFR to induce HaloTag-eDHFR dimerization. Subsequently, green light irradiation inversely isomerizes the photochromic ligand from Z to E and reduces its affinity to eDHFR, leading to dissociation of the protein dimer (Fig. ).pcDH was synthesized according to Supplementary \nQuestion:\n At what wavelength does violet light typically irradiate to isomerize azoMTX from the E isomer to the Z isomer?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: 394 nm", "weight": 1}]}

In every case, photoreversible protein translocation was observed (Fig. , Supplementary Videos 3-5), as was the case with the plasma membrane. eDHFR-miRFP670nano-NES promptly translocated to the ER or mitochondria and diffused back into the cytosol upon light illumination (Fig. ). However, the translocation of eDHFR-miRFP670nano to and from the nucleus required a longer time (Fig. ).

However, design of hypermetallic molecules with linkers different from those shown in Figure may facilitate through-space interactions. Despite these difference, the spectrum of ACCA molecules is similar to that of Li 2 and, in addition to the ionic states, consists from the pairs of dark and bright states. Noteworthy, the oscillator strength of these bright states is doubled as compared to the monomeric ACCH.Third, because of the strongly ionic character of A-C bonds, ACCB show negative DSEs, despite weak stabilizing interactions between the unpaired electrons manifested in singlets being below triplets. We attribute the origin of negative DSEs to Coulomb repulsion between carbons in the charged acetylenic linker. When the Coulomb repulsion contribution is removed, DSEs become positive, reflecting bonding interactions between the unpaired electrons, and their magnitudes fall in a range typical for molecules with strong diradical character (\u223c0-23 kcal/mol).In ACCB molecules, the overall spectrum corresponds to the sum of the ACCH and BCCH spectra with the presence of the ionic states. Natural orbital analysis of the excited states showed that the two electrons act independently: upon excitation one of the electron remains in the local ground state, while the second electron becomes locally excited. Yet, the interaction between two electrons cannot be considered negligible as the excitation energies in ACCB are shifted by 0.01-0.08 eV as compared to the corresponding ACCH.

Moderate activities and good enantiomeric ratios were observed with SCP_Q111BpyAla giving the highest e.r. of 14:86 in favour of the S enantiomer. In general, lower enantioselectivities were observed for the cysteine-modified catalysts and this is attributed to increased flexibility around the active site due to the additional S-CH2 linker. Changing from genetic incorporation of BpyAla at Q111 to bioconjugation of bipyridine through a cysteine, resulted in an unexpected change in the major isomer observed from S to R, albeit with a reduction in enantiomeric excess. This result is intriguing as a major challenge in enzyme catalysis is accessing the opposite product enantiomer. Crystallographic and computational studies confirm that changes in the structure of the active site led to the stabilisation of indole 3 on different sides of the bound enone 4, with the enantiomeric ratios observed correlating with the difference in the calculated transition state energies for the proR and proS SCP_Q111BpyAla and SCP_Q111CBpy Cu catalyst models. Based on these findings, future work should prioritize determining the most suitable modification method for the desired application of the ArM before proceeding with reaction screening and optimization, as subtle differences in protein structure can substantially change the stabilised transition state.The crystal structure obtained of SCP-Q111BpyAla_Cu is a rare example of a protein structure containing an unnatural amino acid.

Fig. illustrates the influence of catalyst dosage (UiO-66-NDC) on the photodegradation mechanism of dyes. The present study involved conducting empirical analyses of catalytic degradation at varying levels of catalyst quantities. The research employed the subsequent experimental conditions: The experimental parameters of the study comprised of a dye concentration of 15 mg/L, a pH level of 5.2, and a temperature of 25\u00b0C. The findings suggest that there is a favorable correlation between the amount of catalyst utilized and the degree of degradation, up to a certain threshold. However, exceeding this threshold level, a higher amount of catalyst results in a decrease in the efficiency of wastewater decolorization. The concentration of catalyst that yielded the best results was determined to be 300 mg/L. During the initial stages of the inquiry, it was observed that the rate of elimination exhibited a direct correlation with an increase in the concentration of the catalyst.After a reaction period of 90 minutes, the elimination rates remained consistent at approximately 70% for all catalyst concentrations, except for the RO16 and MO dyes at a concentration of 200 mg/L. The phenomenon referred to earlier is depicted in Fig. .

The main disadvantage of transporting hydrogen via tube trailers is the high cost of transported hydrogen: a single tube trailer can only carry approximately 400 kg of hydrogen, and the limitation lies in the weight of the steel tubes used as well as in the maximum allowable storage pressure in tube trailers (250 bar in the U.S.). One of the proposals that has recently gained significant attention in the hydrogen world is to repurpose the existing natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure. Transporting hydrogen in a network that has already been commissioned would bring significant advantages including 1) a short(er) time horizon for the development of a large-scale hydrogen transport infrastructure, 2) significantly lower capital expenditures (CAPEX) of the transport system for hydrogen, and 3) to bring freedom and certainty to stakeholders on both the consumption and production sides of hydrogen, so that they can develop projects where they deem it best suited to their interests.The retrofitting of the existing natural gas infrastructure to accommodate hydrogen comes with challenges of its own. As a first example, there could be competition with natural gas. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that natural gas will continue to play a role in the global energy mix, both in the lead up to 2050 and potentially beyond. This implies that hydrogen and natural gas could compete with one another for access to the transport infrastructure; in principle, this could be solved by physically blending hydrogen in the natural gas, albeit blending \nQuestion:\n Why has the proposal to repurpose the existing natural gas infrastructure for hydrogen transport recently gained significant attention?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The proposal to repurpose the existing natural gas infrastructure for hydrogen transport has recently gained significant attention because transporting hydrogen in a network that has already been commissioned would bring significant advantages such as a shorter time horizon for the development of a large-scale hydrogen transport infrastructure, significantly lower capital expenditures of the transport system for hydrogen, and freedom and certainty to stakeholders on both the consumption and production sides of hydrogen, allowing them to develop projects where they deem it best suited to their interests.", "weight": 1}]}

Recently, I developed an adaptive-center (AC) method which allows active region centers to change on-the-fly according to any geometrical criterion, and carried out a proof-of-concept simulation of the DD using the virial stress per atom to identify the disordered regions. The regions with far-from-equilibrium geometries are treated with QM in the AC simulation as expected, but the AC method fails to identify the regions around the fast-moving recoil ions as QM regions, since it would require a speed-dependent criterion. Aside from this problem, it is observed that the sizes of the QM regions change rapidly in the AC simulations, which hampers the accuracy of the simulation.In this paper, I develop a speed-dependent adaptive-center (SDAC) partitioning method for carrying out proper adaptive-partitioning (AP) QM/MM simulations of the DD.

Though decane (32 atoms) is smaller than the drug molecule tamiflu (50 atoms), their conformational entropy values are rather similar. The simple explanation for this is the higher flexiblity of decane, which is typically indicated by a larger relative contribution of S conf to the absolute entropy for similar sized structures. In general S conf will be close to zero for the most rigid molecules or molecules with only a few distinct conformers, but adds a significant portion (ten or more percent) to the absolute entropy for highly flexible molecules.The last contributrion to S conf is the population average S msRRHO . This term may provide insight about the variation of S msRRHO within the ensemble. It will be small if all contributing conformers have a similar ro-vibrational entropy as the reference structure (e.g. for decane with 0.7 cal mol -1 K -1 ), or yields a large contribution in the opposite case (tamiflu, 2.3 cal mol -1 K -1 ). For the latter, computed msRRHO entropies can vary by several entropy units for different conformations rather independently of the chosen \u03c4 or \u03bd scal values. An example is provided in Fig. , where S msRRHO was calculated for 299 (random) conformers of tamiflu at two different theoretical levels (GFN-FF and B97-3c). Here, entropies at the GFN-FF level are overestimated by 4 cal mol -1 K -1 on average compared to the more accurate B97-3c level. Both methods show a similar spread of the S msRRHO values, which range approximately 6 cal mol -1 K -1 from lowest to highest value thus reassureing the use of S msRRHO . Hence, the validity of an approximate S msRRHO obtained at SQM or FF level depends on the performance for relative msRRHO entropies and may be used if a shifted (cf. Eq. 11) population average similar to the higher reference DFT level is expected. Another novelty of our approach is the extrapolation of S conf to the ensemble completeness as \nQuestion:\n How does the ro-vibrational entropy value of decane compare to that of tamiflu?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The ro-vibrational entropy value of decane is smaller than that of tamiflu.", "weight": 1}]}

It is important to note that in all of these cases, the direct bandgaps correspond to the smallest spin-polarized bandgap value. Electronic excitation from valence to conduction band in direct bandgap semiconductors does not require electrons' momentum to change, e.g. via phonon interactions. Therefore, this type of semiconductors are preferred for applications that require efficient photon absorption and photon emission. Our materials have a wide range of direct bandgap values, from 0.20 to 2.02 eV. Three of these materials have the ability to absorb and emit photons in the visible range: Cr-03, Ti-03, and V-03; since their smallest spin-polarized bandgap value falls between 1.65 and 3.26 eV (visible light spectrum). Interestingly, these materials have a similar structure, as they present a TM-03 intercalation pattern (with the intercalants positioned at the centroid of all benzene rings). The spin-polarized band structures and projected DOS for these materials are plotted in Figure . In this figure, we observe the important role of the transition metals, which provide electron density from their 3d-orbitals near the Fermi level. The transition metals and carbon atoms provide the largest electron density at the CBM/VBM. Thus, it is evident that the carbon 2p-orbitals in the COF layers hybridize with the TM d-orbitals, providing the unique direct-semiconducting electronic structures observed. These results confirm our hypothesis that promoting pd orbital interactions between the COFs and TMs leads to a modification of the electronic structure and properties of these systems. Furthermore, Ti-04a, V-04a, and V-01a-which are also direct semiconductors-have their larger spin-polarized bandgaps in the visible range and, although less likely, these visible-range direct transitions can also occur for these materials.From Table <ref \nQuestion:\n Why are direct bandgap semiconductors preferred for applications that require efficient photon absorption and photon emission?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Direct bandgap semiconductors are preferred for such applications because electronic excitation from the valence to the conduction band in these semiconductors does not require a change in the electrons' momentum, such as via phonon interactions.", "weight": 1}]}

However, one major setback of the OLED technology is that the devices are very sensitive to the impurities present in the OLED materials, impacting device lifetime, stability, and overall performance. The isolation of large quantities of the main OLED components from the synthetic impurities is challenging using the traditional purification process (i.e., train sublimation), which has poor reproducibility, and high capital and operating cost. Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) could lend itself as an alternative technique for the profiling of impurities and their purification.

One of the possible reasons is the nature of the functional groups themselves. Apart from their dynamic nature under specific conditions, alkenes, disulfides, acetals, imines, esters, etc. are not functional groups that are commonly found in drug-like molecules. Therefore, these functional groups serve as crossover points that need to be decorated with substructures with drug-like characteristics. The hits from the screenings have to be converted to more drug-like molecules that can represent a formidable challenge. Also, limited stability in aqueous conditions may require additional reaction steps to stop the crossover (e.g., reduction of imines to amines).

This gold layer is coated with a thin SiO 2 layer that allows the covalent attachment of a PA gel without producing a substantial background signal . This renders the substrates suitable for the construction of the aforementioned microarray platform for screening HSC fate decisions and other types of stem cells with noninvasive Raman spectroscopy. To fabricate the substrates, thermal vapor deposition was used to deposit a 5-nm-thick chromium (Cr) adhesion layer on the glass substrate, followed a 50nm-thick gold (Au) layer. The thickness of each layer was monitored during deposition with a quartz crystal thickness monitor. These layer thicknesses were validated by using X-ray reflectivity, and good agreement was found (Figure ). Then a 100-nm-thick silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) layer was deposited on top of the gold layer using PECVD. Based on use of this fabrication process to create a single batch of substrates, we calculate our cost is $3.35 per substrate, which is approximately 8 times less expensive than the commercially available (Thorlabs) protected gold mirror substrate (Table ). Of course, the cost would further decrease for both academic and nonacademic users if multiple batches were fabricated at a time.

Pure JUC-557-nanosheet showed low sensitivity for various anions (Supplementary Fig. ).

However, when F -ion was added into this system, the fluorescence of JUC-557-nanosheet with Fe 3+ was remarkably enhanced (up to 38%), which could be attributed to the formation of a stable coordination complex, FeF 6 3-. The quenched fluorescence of JUC-557-nanosheet with Fe 3+ could not be fully recovered because there may be a competitive equilibrium between the cyan group and F -with Fe 3+ . Interestingly, different from the detection of F -, the addition of I -resulted in an even more fluorescence decrease of JUC-557-nanosheet with Fe 3+ (as low as 6%) since I -can be oxidized to I 2 by Fe 3+ ions.Although partial Fe 3+ ions were consumed during the formation of I 2 , the decline of fluorescence of JUC-557-nanosheet with Fe 3+ was obvious, which may be because the nanosheet with Fe 3+ was more sensitive to the generated I 2 .

We have described these problems and the methods we developed and implemented in Sella to ameliorate them in a previous work. Our algorithm constructs a complete set of internal coordinates by mapping all possible pairs, triplets, and quadruplets of sequentially-bonded atoms from a molecular graph to bond distance, bending angle, and dihedral angle coordinates, respectively. This procedure is described in detail in appendix A.One problem that is frequently encountered when constructing internal coordinate systems is bending angles may become nearly or completely linear. This is a problem because linear bending angles do not have a well-defined Cartesian derivative, and dihedral angle coordinates which contain a linear angle are undefined. This problem is typically solved by manually replacing the pathological angle with one or more new coordinates, usually an improper dihedral or in-and out-of-plane bending angles. However, if the central atom of the pathological angle is only bonded to two other atoms, then it is not possible to define a chemically meaningful improper dihedral to replace the angle. In that case, it is necessary to define a new, so-called \"dummy\" atom, which is used to help define the improper dihedral. For this scenario, we have developed an algorithm for automatically adding dummy atoms to a molecule, potentially even mid-optimization. This is a key aspect of our method, as without automatic reconstruction of internal coordinates, some molecular saddle point optimizations will fail due to the coordinate system becoming ill-defined. To the best of our knowledge, no other optimizer automatically reconstructs the internal \nQuestion:\n What is done if the central atom of the pathological angle is only bonded to two other atoms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: A new 'dummy' atom is defined to help in defining the improper dihedral.", "weight": 1}]}

We first note that the evolution time constants produced by the fitting are quite similar for all three datasets, allowing us to directly compare the spectra of different components between the three excitation wavelengths.In the IA-300 region, the induced absorption band exhibits a 0.5-ps growth, and then decays almost to zero over the next 1.1 ps evolution step (see transition from black to red in Figure ). This is in contrast with all the other spectral regions (GSB-355, IA-400, GSB-550 and IA-GSB-600),where the absorption difference decays twofold in 0.5 ps, but in the subsequent 1.1 ps remains approximately constant, albeit with small spectral shifts. These shifts are best noticeable in the GSB-355 region, where the GSB maximum first shifts to the red, and then back to the blue. The spectral evolution on ca. 10-ps timescale produces the most dramatic spectral change (green-to-blue in Figure ). IA-330 reappears (slightly red-shifted compared to the 1.1-ps spectrum), while GSB-355 shifts noticeably to the red and develops a negative tail, replacing the initially-observed positive IA-400 with negative GSB (the latter is clearly discerned in the blue EADS at wavelengths up to 400 nm). This is accompanied by the disappearance of IA in the IA-GSB-600 spectral region, and the emergence of a negative GSB signal. Within ca. 50-60 ps, the blue EADS is replaced by cyan EADS, where -once again -most of IA-330 is lost, the negative peak of GSB-355 is again shifted to the blue, and IA-400 reappears, reminiscent of the signal observed at the 10 ps evolutionary step.

Only single quantum coherences can be directly detected in magnetic resonance echo experiments, and so the remaining operators must be converted to a detectable form in order to measure their expectation values. A general protocol for performing quantum state tomography on an \ud835\udc5bqubit system by NMR consists of a series of experiments in which one of three operations is applied to each spin prior to detection of the FID signal. The choices of operations are: i. do nothing, or apply a 90\u00b0 'filter' pulse along ii. +\ud835\udc65 or iii. +\ud835\udc66, which we will denote 1, X, and Y, respectively. In a two-qubit system there are nine possible pairs of operations, and any Cartesian operator can be converted into a detectable single-quantum in-or anti-phase coherence by at least one combination (Table ). While it is possible to measure all operators with just four combinations it is common practice to perform all nine experiments to allow for repeated observations. This protocol relies on the ability to measure both in-and anti-phase coherences. However the ensemble broadening of EPR spectra precludes the direct detection of anti-phase coherences in the weak inter-spin coupling regime that we consider here. As a result, to transfer this procedure from NMR to EPR it is necessary to devise a detection sequence capable of measuring the expectation values of anti-phase coherences. To accomplish this, we draw inspiration from the 3P-and 4P-Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) experiments (Figure ) in which \nQuestion:\n Why is it necessary to devise a detection sequence capable of measuring the expectation values of anti-phase coherences when transferring the quantum state tomography procedure from NMR to EPR?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: It is necessary to devise a detection sequence capable of measuring the expectation values of anti-phase coherences when transferring the procedure from NMR to EPR because the ensemble broadening of EPR spectra precludes the direct detection of anti-phase coherences in the weak inter-spin coupling regime.", "weight": 1}]}

Thus, we may expect reduction of installation and maintenance cost of RED and PRO based electric power generation in near future.Closed loop PRO and RED methods are developing which would be capable of extracting much higher power density from salinity gradient. Not only that, closed loop systems would reduce bad environmental impact of PRO and RED. A closed-loop system, which is termed as a heat engine , converts thermal energy to mechanical work or electricity. In this method PRO or RED method is used to generate electricity from mixing of sea water and river water and then the resultant mixture is separated by thermal energy to high-concentration and lowconcentration solution to recycle back. To make this process economically viable, in general, waste heat, like geothermal energy from shallow wells and low-grade heat of power plants, is used for thermal separation. Advantage of this process is that we may use any concentrated electrolyte instead of sea water and river water as recycling is possible. It is obvious that the use of high concentrated solution would produce higher energy density extraction. For example, an ammonia-carbon-dioxide solution of 5M concentrations is capable of generating power densities of 250W m -2 .

According to the fluorescence spectra (Figure ), a 3 mM solution of H4FBCDC linker in NMP shows a yellow emission with maximum at 17,750 cm -1 (\u03bbExt. = 27,397 cm -1 ). However, no fluorescence of the solid linker powder can be observed. This fluorescence quenching in the solid state is most likely due to the efficient \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking of the linkers. In contrast, in the crystal of DUT-140 the MOPs are interconnected by the fluorenone containing backbones into a three-dimensional structure. As a result, the fluorenone moieties are isolated from other groups and therefore not involved in any weak interactions, which prevents fluorescence quenching as it is shown in figure of the supplementary information. However, d-d transitions in the d Cu 2+ ions still hinder a spectroscopic investigation of the linker in the network. As a result, no fluorescence can be detected after crystallization of the MOF, as this is suppressed due to the complex formation and quenching.Nevertheless, the UV/Vis spectra of the DUT-140(Cu) in the op and cp phases were recorded and compared with simulated UV/Vis spectra of the straight and bent ligand (Figure ).

Selected performance metrics are listed in Table .As can be seen, the onset potential (vs. RHE) of the cell was 1.460 V, of which 1.439 V originated in the anode and 0.021 V derived from the cathode.The cell resistance was 324 m\u2126 cm 2 , of which the anode contributed a surprisingly low 61 m\u2126 cm 2 while the cathode contributed a much higher 263 m\u2126 cm 2 . Thus, while the anode had a notably higher onset potential than the cathode, consistent with the more sluggish nature of the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) relative to the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER), it produced far smaller increases in voltage as the current density increased, than the cathode.Thus, in going from a current density of 0.1 A cm -2 to 0.5 A cm -2 to 1 A cm -2 , the overpotential at the anode changed from 240 mV to 294 mV to 329 mV; a total increase of 89 mV.

Accordingly, the performance of the cell was dominated by the anode at low current densities, but increasingly by the cathode at high current densities.Given that the carbon fiber paper (CFP) at the cathode was specified to have a resistance of <10 m\u2126 cm 2 and the contact resistance at the cathode was previously found to be only 3-5 m\u2126 cm 2 , this raises a question about the origin of the high, 263 m\u2126 cm 2 resistance at the cathode.To try to answer that question, the formation of gas bubbles at the cathode and anode as a function of current density was examined.2.1.3 Gas Bubble Detection at the Anode and Cathode of the Capillary-Fed \nQuestion:\n What is the resistance contributed by the cathode in the cell?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The cathode contributed a resistance of 263 m\u03a9 cm 2.", "weight": 1}]}

The large eddy turnover time for impinging sheets is approximately equal to the residence time of liquid in the impingement zone. Since energy is only dissipated in the impingement zone and turbulence is damped within one large eddy turnover time, stretching or folding of lamella was assumed to be negligible.Turbulence energy cascade theory assumes that large or integral eddies supply energy to small eddies at a rate that is inversely proportional to the large-eddy turnover time. Energy is passed down to smaller eddies in the inertial range until it is ultimately dissipated by eddy sizes in which viscous forces dominate (dissipation range). Thus, the EDD model, as employed for impinging sheets, assumed that the fixed striation or slab size was the Kolmorogov microscale (\ud835\udf02).The results of the azo-coupling study indicated that the Kolmogorov microscale provided a satisfactory estimate for the slab thickness for liquids at a viscosity of 1 cP. However, at higher viscosities, setting the slab thickness to \ud835\udf02 severely underestimated the thickness in which diffusion and reaction occurred. In order for the experimental results to agree with the EDD model, a significantly larger microscale was used. This microscale was intuitively derived by setting the slab thickness approximately equal to the size scale at which the energy dissipation rate is equal to the viscous dissipation rate. The overall micromixing results were explained as flow in the low-viscosity experiments was turbulent and flow in the higher viscosity experiments was pre-turbulent or transitional between laminar flow and fully-developed turbulence.The range of Reynolds numbers in which fully-developed turbulence occurs depends upon the system.

Our calculations show that this is due to quenched orbital angular momentum in the ground state; vibrational modulation of gor A-anisotropy is minimized because of the near-isotropic nature of these two parameters, effectively rendering the two-level quantum system insensitive to environmental and molecular vibrations.. The isotropic nature of the spin Hamiltonian is also consistent with the observation that there is no significant variation in relaxation dynamics for different orientations, despite the 4d z 2 admixture to the SOMO. The distinction between 1 and other proposed molecular qubits is clear when comparing the relaxation behaviour of, for example, complexes of V(IV) or Cu(II) (both S = 1/2) which have much larger g and A M anisotropies owing to the 3d-dominated ground configurations (8,9,11,26), despite having broadly similar spin orbit coupling constants to Y.Hence, we conclude the very robust relaxation behaviour of 1 is intrinsically associated with the isotropic electronic structure, which is due to practically nil orbital angular momentum in the ground state. The near isotropic magnetic properties mean that 1 is behaving spectroscopically like an atomic 2 S-state.Preliminary solution phase studies and calculations of 2 -4 show this is a general phenomenon (see Supplementary Information); 4 contains amide ligands, not Cp ligands, and hence the phenomenon is due to engineering the electronic structure of the metal and not due to a specific ligand.The utility of a 2 S 1/2 -like electronic ground state has long been exploited in trapped atom/ion qubits studied at milli-Kelvin temperatures (27-29).

Violet light irradiation, typically at 394 nm, isomerizes azoMTX from the E isomer to the Z isomer, whereas green light, typically at 560 nm, induces reverse isomerization from Z to E. Since (Z)-azoMTX has a higher affinity to eDHFR than the E isomer, azoMTX was associated with and dissociated from eDHFR repeatedly by alternating irradiation with different wavelengths of light. Accordingly, we designed a small-molecule dimerizer pcDH (Fig. ), which involves both an azoMTX-based photochromic eDHFR ligand and HaloTag ligand, to establish a photochromic CID system. One of the carboxy groups of azoMTX was removed for the design of pcDH to enhance its cell membrane permeability. Since the HaloTag ligand, a chloroalkyl group, specifically forms a covalent bond with a HaloTag protein (33 kDa) , pcDH is spontaneously labeled with HaloTag-fused proteins in living cells. Under dark conditions, binding to eDHFR can be suppressed because the thermally stable E form of the photochromic ligand shows a low affinity to eDHFR. UV to violet light irradiation isomerizes the photochromic ligand and enhances the affinity to eDHFR to induce HaloTag-eDHFR dimerization. Subsequently, green light irradiation inversely isomerizes the photochromic ligand from Z to E and reduces its affinity to eDHFR, leading to dissociation of the protein dimer (Fig. ).pcDH was synthesized according to Supplementary \nQuestion:\n Why does azoMTX show a higher affinity to eDHFR when irradiated with violet light compared to green light?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: AzoMTX shows a higher affinity to eDHFR when irradiated with violet light because this irradiation isomerizes azoMTX from the E isomer to the Z isomer, which has a higher affinity to eDHFR.

As evidenced by VT-DRIFTS, the triazolate vibrational modes displayed temperature dependence. As was observed for the dynamic bonds in carboxylate MOFs, the shift in wavenumbers can be attributed to the coexistence of \"tight\" and \"loose\" states in equilibrium. Interestingly, an inversion in the vibrational redshift was observed at the SCO transition temperature (Fig. ). This phenomenon is analogous to the behaviour observed for the soft phonon modes associated with phase transitions in SrTiO3 (Fig ).

Simple examples of this importance are found in common metal oxo motifs in metalloenzymes, ranging from the iron-based cytochrome P450 enzymes and methane monooxygenases to molybdenum-based sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. Each of these systems carry out specific chemical reactions that harness high-energy M=O motifs and enable oxidations that would not occur with molecular oxygen alone. Moving down one row in the periodic table, sulfur also plays key roles in biology, particularly during most of Earth's history that was devoid of atmospheric oxygen. For example, the low solubility of metal sulfides helps to potentiate the bioavailability of metals dissolved in oceans and other bodies of water. Similarly, sulfide lowers heavy metal ion toxicity in archaea native to hyperthermophilic vent environments, which were likely early locales capable of supporting life. These reducing environments devoid of oxygen but rich in sulfur provided a home for early chemolithoautotrophic and sulfur-reducing microorganisms that likely built the cornerstones of bioinorganic metal-chalcogen chemistry still found today in modern biology.Under such prebiotic conditions, carbon-containing sulfur compounds, such as carbonyl sulfide (COS), have also been hypothesized to play important roles in developing molecular complexity. For example, COS is the most prevalent sulfur-containing gas in Earth's atmosphere and is often found at elevated concentrations near volcanoes and hot springs. In the presence of amino acids, COS can act as a coupling agent to form dipeptides, aminoacyl phosphates, and aminoacyl adenylates, all of which are important building \nQuestion:\n What is the most prevalent sulfur-containing gas in Earth's atmosphere?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: COS", "weight": 1}]}

At higher current densities, above the 200-300 mA cm -2 range, this difference in acoustic activity increases further with a higher gradient observed with the cathode relative to the anode (Figure (a)). This again matches well with results obtained from voltage fluctuation experiments. This difference between the higher acoustic activity observed with the cathode relative to the anode, particularly at current densities above 200-300 mA cm -2 is more clearly observed by studying the cumulative energy of the acoustic hits (Figure (b)). Thus far, the focus has been on the number of hits recorded, which gives a good indication of the acoustic activity but does not include all information. By looking at the cumulative energy, this not only takes into account the total number of hits but other factors associated with each hit such as the duration and frequency of each hit.

The optimal peptide polymer demonstrates strong in vivo therapeutic potential in an adult zebrafish infection model. Moreover, the optimal peptide polymer is biodegradable by enzyme into single amino acids and dipeptides to totally lose antibacterial activity and, therefore, will not cause antimicrobial selective pressure.

UPS and NEXAFS show that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of the alternant molecule pyrene, and theory predicts a very similar difference of 0.87 eV. The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding an even larger difference of 1.09 eV. One reason why this difference is larger for azupyrene is due to symmetry selection rules, which result in a forbidden HOMO\u2192LUMO transition and the lack of fluorescence for azupyrene. These special properties of azupyrene's electronic structure are related to the nonalternant topology of its \uf070-electron system. The topology of azupyrene also leads to a more localized charge distribution, visible in the experimental XPS and NMR shifts as well as in the DFT-calculated partial charges, all showing a negative charge surplus at the apices of the 7-membered rings and positive charge at the central C2-unit. The conjugated system of pyrene is best described as a biphenyl with two ethenediyl bridges, whereas azupyrene is a [14]annulene with a central double-bonded C2 unit. This interpretation follows from HOMA considerations, bond length changes, and the vibrational modes seen in experimental and calculated IR spectra. Overall, we found that the topology of the \uf070electron system drastically influences the electronic structure of the two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Those differences in electronic structure are reflected in the absorption and fluorescence behavior, a lower electron-hole binding energy, and a lower barrier to electron-hole separation for azupyrene. The possible application of nonalternant molecules in organic electronic devices is favored by those differences. We propose \nQuestion:\n Why are the electronic properties of azupyrene different from those of pyrene?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The differences in the electronic properties between azupyrene and pyrene are primarily due to the topology of their \u03c0-electron systems.

However, in the recent years there has been a growing interest in studies of Cu(III) complexes as intermediates in cross-coupling reactions and in biological systems. Moreover, very recently Cu(III) macrocyclic complexes with labile monodentate ligands (F, CN, ONO) were successfully used in radical C-H functionalization processes. Among known Cu(III) compounds, trifluoromethyl complexes are exceptionally stable species. Neutral complexes with bidentate N-donor ligands such as (bpy)Cu(CF3)3 (Grushin's reagent) and (phen)Cu(CF3)3 were shown to serve as unique C-H trifluoromethylation reagents of radical or radical-polar crossover type. C-H trifluoromethylation of arenes, alkenes, alkynes, and C(sp 3 )-H bonds using the Grushin's reagent or its analogues was demonstrated recently, including the latestage functionalization of biomolecules. In contrast to rapid emergence of applications of Cu(III) trifluoromethyl complexes in organic chemistry, the structural variety of these compounds is very narrow. Nearly all of the applications are based on N-donor Cu(III)-CF3 complexes, very similar in reactivity and properties. Thus, investigation of organometallic chemistry of high-valent copper is an important task. Very recently, we discovered novel Cu(III) 1,3-diketonate complexes bearing only two trifluoromethyl groups, such as (acac)Cu(CF3)2 and (dbm)Cu(CF3)2, which displayed high reactivity in direct C-H \nQuestion:\n Which complexes are exceptionally stable species among known Cu(III) compounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Trifluoromethyl complexes", "weight": 1}]}

For comparison, analysis of VT-DRIFTS data yielded ln Ktl (Ktl = [tight]/[loose]) values of 1.84 under vacuum. While this value, defined in analogy to Kf of molecules, is higher than previously studied carboxylate MOFs, it is smaller than coordination-based \"self-healing\" materials with values in the range of 9-25, suggesting even the most \"stable\" MOFs exhibit bond flexibility. Introduction of air caused ln Ktl to drop to 1.7 and the introduction of Lewis-basic molecules caused it to decrease even further, with Et3N giving a Ktl of just -0.6. Furthermore, guest molecules with larger Gutmann donor numbers-a measure of Lewis basicity-caused greater redshifts. These results suggest that the MOF ML bond equilibria involve unbound conformers to such a degree that guest molecules bind to the MOF metal sites.

For the N by N surprisal matrix we can write an exact expansion in the N 2 matrices of the Gelfand basis . This is the matrix form of Eq. ( ). One can regard this necessarily exact expression in an N by N basis as a result of maximal entropy subject to the N 2 constraints with the as their conjugate Lagrange multipliers. Of course, speaking from a parsimonious point of view, this can be many more constraints than are strictly needed but maximal entropy subject to more than the minimal number of valid constraints does yield correct results.The representation of the surprisal matrix uses, as in other examples above, time-independent constraints and their time-dependent Lagrange multipliers.The set of constraints is closed because the Gelfand states are closed under commutation amongst themselves, and any N by N matrix, including the Hamiltonian, can be written as a linear combination of the Gelfand basis matrices. What are the basis states is a matter of convenience. It can be a set of zero order wavefunctions or it can be points in a discrete grid.

In the hetero-nuclear case standard rectangular pulses can be used to excite each nucleus separately, as their Larmor frequencies will be significantly different. The use of multiple simultaneous pulses at different frequencies is a key part of many common NMR experiments, such as the closely related Insensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarization Transfer (INEPT) technique. In homo-spin systems the two spins can be excited selectively, either by long low-powered pulses or using shaped pulses. The use of simultaneous pulses is generally avoided in EPR as overlap of pulses in time tends to lead to distortions in data. For example the 3P-DEER sequence (Figure ) has a 'dead-time' at short \ud835\udc61, where the initial detection and pump pulses overlap in time. The 4P-DEER sequence (Figure ) circumvents the dead-time and so has almost completely superseded 3P-DEER. The principle cause of pulse distortion is the non-linear amplitude response of microwave components involved in pulse generation, which tend to saturate at a maximum outputted power. To characterise the amplitude response of our spectrometer, we recorded the attainable nutation frequency of pulses as a function of their amplitude prior to amplification.

The enantiomer degenaracy number g i is obtained automatically as described in detail the Supporting Information. For the msRRHO part, any quantum chemical method or even force-fields can be applied. Here, we use the composite DFT method B97-3c and the well-known B3LYP-D3 functional in a standard def2-TZVP basis.  Note that for large systems step two could in principle also be conducted at a low theory level (SQM or FF). However, because step three is usually the computational bottleneck, it is recommended to take S msRRHO from a more accurate DFT treatment. In general, this partitioning allows systematic improvements of the scheme because the different contributions can in principle be calculated at any level of theory.If no low-lying conformers (relative energy <1-2 kcal/mol at ambient temperature) are found in the first step, the entropy run is not necessary and the plain S msRRHO value can be taken.

Both of these HOCO and LUCO localization patterns are consistent with previous work  It is worth noting that the ssDNA structures with purine nucleobases (i.e., A and G) have a significantly lower hole mobility than the corresponding structures with pyrimidine nucleobases (i.e., T and C). This is due to the HOCOs in poly(A) and poly(G) being formed from the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of A and G (cf.

Conversely, the ssDNA structures with purine nucleobases have a significantly higher electron mobility than the corresponding structures with pyrimidine nucleobases. This trend arises from the LUCOs in poly(A) and poly(G) having a larger overlap than the corresponding LUCOs in poly(T) and poly(C), as can be seen in Figure .Furthermore, both A and G contain more sp 2 hybridized segments with highly electronegative atomic species (i.e., nitrogen and oxygen) than C and T.

This results in a partial negative charge on the nitrogen and oxygen atoms and a partial positive charge on the neighboring carbon atoms.

We employed cells from the CHO and CHO-T cell lines because they are very closely related, so we expected their spectra would be as similar to one another as those from primary HSCs and their progeny.

However, the large identity component of the density matrix, arising from working in the high temperature limit, meant that only \"pseudoentangled\" states were accessible. Pseudo-entanglement was also demonstrated in an electron-nuclear ensemble system generated by x-ray irradiation of a malonic acid crystal. By working at low temperatures and introducing a polarisation transfer step between the electron and nuclear spins, it was possible to initiate a sufficiently pure starting state that real electron-nuclear entanglement was confirmed in an ensemble of phosphorus donors in silicon. Interest in identifying systems in which all qubits are electron spins is motivated by the observation that, owing to their larger Zeeman couplings compared to nuclear spins, a sufficiently pure starting state may be obtained in thermal equilibrium at readily achievable temperatures.Many physical systems have been proposed as electron spin qubits including nitrogenvacancy centres in diamonds and quantum dots in silicon, though the top-down synthesis of these spin centres makes precise control of inter-spin coupling difficult, complicating their use as multi-qubit structures. This led to the proposal of Molecular Electron Spin Qubits (MESQs), in which bottom-up synthesis allows for more precise control of inter-spin interactions.

The C1s signals are centered at 284.66 eV for azupyrene and 284.81 eV for pyrene with respect to the Fermi energy EF. The azupyrene peak shows a larger width (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 1.16 eV) and is slightly asymmetric with a shoulder at the high binding energy side. The pyrene peak is symmetric and has a smaller width (FWHM = 0.94 eV). The differences in peak shape and peak width can be explained with the help of DFT calculations, which provide the binding energies for the individual carbon atoms in the molecules. For this purpose, the core-electron binding energies were calculated with a localized core-hole in a \uf044SCF scheme and compared to the experimental data by way of a fitting procedure. In this procedure, the relative binding energies and relative intensities (given by the number of symmetry equivalent carbon atoms) were taken as fixed parameters forming the overall theoretical C 1s peak of the molecule as sum over the equivalent carbon sub peaks, each represented by a pseudo-Voigt peak. The single-peakwidth and the Gaussian-to-Lorentzian ratio were constricted to be equal for all sub peaks and were parameters of the fit procedure together with the overall intensity and a global energy shift. As can be seen in Figure ,b, the agreement between experiment and theory is remarkably good, allowing us to explain the peak shape based on the theoretical model.

The value of computational results for catalysis lies on whether the reliable computational thermodynamics at the specific condition could be obtained in theoretical approach.Notably, reaction temperature often plays a significant role in the activity as well as the selectivity for a catalytic reaction. Accurate calculation of the temperature-dependent thermodynamics in catalysis is thus critical for revealing the correct molecular mechanism and further guiding the rational design of more efficient catalytic processes.

In particular, the use of plasmonic nanoparticles in the field of heterogeneous catalysis for achieving enhanced reactivity at relatively milder operating conditions has gained significant attention. The key features driving these developments are, ability to tailor properties of plasmonic nanoparticles towards harnessing light energy to catalyze chemical reactions and obtaining chemical selectivity, otherwise not readily possible using conventional methods. An important question emerging from these studies is regarding the nature of energy transfer from electronically excited nanoparticles to the reactants, ultimately leading to product formation. Mukherjee and coworkers have reported enhanced rates of H 2 + D 2 isotope exchange reaction catalyzed by plasmonic excitation of Au nanoparticles on TiO 2 support. With the aid of first principles calculations along with experimental data, they conclude that enhanced rates result from a transient electron transfer process where the hot electrons generated from plasmonic excitation transfer to the anti-bonding orbitals of adsorbate molecules (reactants) thereby reducing the dissociation barrier.

Our proteomics data set is limited in distinguishing peptides from unmodified ones, therefore little information was obtained whether MLKL and/or pMLKL was acylated.

Acylation of phosphoMLKL occurs downstream of phosphorylation and oligomerization and appears to be, in part, mediated by ZDHHC5 (a palmitoyl transferase).

In the case of water molecule, it is known from standard EOM-CCSD that triple excitations are significant in the bond-breaking regime . In the case of the H 4 /STO-3G system, one needs to take into account triple excitations for T 1 , T 2 , S 2 , and S 3 states. In addition, even quadruple level of excitations (FCI level) need to be considered to achieve the target accuracy for S 1 with a much smaller subspace resulting in the electronic configurations, which are expected to recover the electronic correlations of the current excited state. That is, the dimension of the working space remains within a practical regime for classical computers. The numerical example of H 4 /STO-3G with SDTQ level of excitations is shown in Fig. .Note that the dimension of the working space does not grow significantly with the Davidson method. However, the increase in the level of excitations leads to the increase in the number of projections to be measured in the residual vector calculations of Eq.

In addition, an increase in temperature also results in lower viscosity of the mobile phase and higher solute diffusivity. All these factors affect the retentivity of the compounds and the overall resolution of the separation.In this study, the effect of temperature on the resolution and retention of the molecular glass compounds was investigated in the range of 35 to 50 \u00b0C. Since the separation of the compounds was affected differently at low and high backpressures, we investigated the temperature effect at the backpressure of 100 and 180 bar; other parameters were kept constant.Figure illustrates the separation of the OLED compounds at different temperatures for the two backpressures studied. At the backpressure of 100 bar, the elution time of the molecular glass compounds seemed to remain unchanged with the increasing temperature, while at 180 bar, a slight decrease in the retention of the compounds was observed. This is probably because, at 100 bar, the mobile phase was more in the subcritical state rather than in the supercritical state; therefore, the impact on the viscosity of the mobile phase and diffusivity of the solutes upon a change in temperature was much less at that condition. Therefore, the retention of the isomeric OLED compounds seemed to be unaffected at 100 bar. On the other hand, at 180 bar, the mobile phase was more in the supercritical state, which has more impact on the viscosity and diffusivity.Therefore, as the temperature was increased at the backpressure of 180 bar, a slight decrease in the retention of the compounds was observed, which can be attributed to a decrease in the viscosity of the mobile phase \nQuestion:\n In this study, the effect of temperature on the resolution and retention of the molecular glass compounds was investigated in what range?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: 35 to 50 \u00b0C", "weight": 1}]}

The results from the megaTYR mutant screen show that bacterially derived tyrosinases possess sufficient selectivity to mediate protein-protein coupling reactions through tyrosine-cysteine bond formation, and can be engineered to alter their substrate preferences. The success at modulating the charge preference of this enzyme indicates that it is tolerant toward mutation and can be engineered to achieve orthogonal reactivity preferences to those of abTYR. The result of these efforts is the ability to sequentially activate tyrosine residues based on their charge context, or CDSAT. The protein trimers created using CDSAT show that minimal engineering is required to produce a system capable of creating higher-order protein constructs.

The C1s signals are centered at 284.66 eV for azupyrene and 284.81 eV for pyrene with respect to the Fermi energy EF. The azupyrene peak shows a larger width (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 1.16 eV) and is slightly asymmetric with a shoulder at the high binding energy side. The pyrene peak is symmetric and has a smaller width (FWHM = 0.94 eV). The differences in peak shape and peak width can be explained with the help of DFT calculations, which provide the binding energies for the individual carbon atoms in the molecules. For this purpose, the core-electron binding energies were calculated with a localized core-hole in a \uf044SCF scheme and compared to the experimental data by way of a fitting procedure. In this procedure, the relative binding energies and relative intensities (given by the number of symmetry equivalent carbon atoms) were taken as fixed parameters forming the overall theoretical C 1s peak of the molecule as sum over the equivalent carbon sub peaks, each represented by a pseudo-Voigt peak. The single-peakwidth and the Gaussian-to-Lorentzian ratio were constricted to be equal for all sub peaks and were parameters of the fit procedure together with the overall intensity and a global energy shift. As can be seen in Figure ,b, the agreement between experiment and theory is remarkably good, allowing us to explain the peak shape based on the theoretical model. According to this analysis, the asymmetry of the azupyrene peak is caused by the more distinctly different chemical environments of its carbon atoms.

Only one additional outlier, triethylamine (TEA), is observed for the combined LBH+AS23 set, but since it is present for all four method combinations, it may not be attributed to a wrong conformational energy landscape. The origin of the error for TEA (overestimation by approximately 5 %) remains unknown, but it has not been removed from the statistics presented in Tab. 2. Without TEA the statistics would improve even further to low MADs and RMSDs of 0.77 and 1.04 cal mol -1 K -1 for B97-3c and 0.87 and 1.18 cal mol -1 K -1 for B3LYP in combination with S conf (GFN2-xTB), respecitvely. The best overall result for the LBH+AS23 set after removing all outliers is obtained with B97-3c+S conf (GFN-FF).Interestingly, our S msRRHO + S conf values tend to slightly overestimate compared to the experimental data, while the opposite holds for approaches that go beyond the harmonic approximation, such as UM-VT. This is indicated by the mean deviation, which for the LBH benchmark set is always positive for our approach and always negative for different version of the methods presented in Ref. 6. Tentatively, this may be attributed to some missing (configurational) contributions in UM-VT and/or to our strict separation of harmonic vibrational terms and conformational terms. The latter mainly concerns low frequency modes that are correlated to conformational transitions and which were a key motivation for the mRRHO method with the rotor cut-off \u03c4 as an adjustable variable.

Raman microspectroscopy, often combined with multivariate analysis techniques such as partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), could enable the non-invasive identification of stem cell fate decisions made in response to extrinsic cues presented at specific locations on these microarrays. Because existing biomaterial microarrays are not compatible with Raman microspectroscopy, here, we develop an inexpensive substrate that is compatible with both single-cell Raman spectroscopy and the chemistries that are often used for biomaterial microarray fabrication. Standard deposition techniques were used to fabricate a custom Raman-compatible substrate that supports microarray construction. We validated that spectra from living cells on functionalized polyacrylamide (PA) gels attached to the custom Raman-compatible substrate are comparable to spectra acquired from a more expensive commercially available substrate. We also showed that the spectra acquired from individual living cells on functionalized PA gels attached to our custom substrates were of sufficient quality to enable accurate identification of cell phenotypes using PLS-DA models of the cell spectra. We demonstrated this by using cells from laboratory lines (CHO and transfected CHO cells) as well as adult stem cells that were freshly isolated from mice (long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cells).

The selective purification of each species of lycopene aggregate would clearly be ideal, but this may well turn out to be extremely complex given the number of different aggregate types formed here and reported in the literature.

Both linear and branched alcohols were competent nucleophiles, affording the desired products (73-75) in good yields. A secondary amine nucleophile was also well tolerated (77); however, reactions with several primary amines resulted in an undesired condensation reaction with the pendant aldehyde to form imines. Thiol nucleophiles reacted smoothly to provide the desired conjugate addition products (20 and 76) in excellent yields. The comparatively high yield of thioether adducts relative to alkyl ether adducts is likely due to the increased nucleophilicity of sulfur as well as stability of the sulfur adducts compared to the alcohol precursor. The feasibility of benzylic C-C bond formation was probed through inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reactions. The reactivity of biocatalyst-generated benzyl alcohol 17 with various dienophiles was evaluated through a one-pot reaction sequence.

Furthermore, d B-O tends to expand with respect to the pristine structure for all intercalations except TM-01b, TM-03, and TM-04b, which had a value comparable to that of the pristine structure.

After PSM, the isotherm of the material changed. The hysteresis loop became most like a type H4 one [65] , in which the adsorption branch resembles a combination of Types I and II isotherms and the lower limit of the desorption branch is usually located at the cavitation-induced relative pressure. This behavior suggests that mesopores became clogged by sulfate groups hence inducing pore blocking and cavitation effects. Furthermore, the pore size distribution, Figure , of ZrBTC-114.6-S was starkly different from the one calculated for ZrBTC-114.6. Particularly, mesopores were enlarged while the family of micropores with an average size of 1.53 nm disappeared. These trends were consistent with the surface areas calculated through the \u03c7-method, Table . Indeed, the total surface area of the PSM MOF decreased ca. 33 % (SA\u03c7 = 704 m 2 /g) as compared to ZrBTC-114.6 (SA\u03c7 = 1050 m 2 /g). Furthermore, the surface area corresponding to microporous from the family with an average size of 1.53 nm amounted to zero whereas the mesoporous surface area dropped ca. 83%. Also, the total pore volume exhibited a reduction of ca. ca. 54 % after PSM. These results suggest that, on the one hand, sulfate ions are hindered from entering ultramicopores in Zr-MOFs and that, on the other hand, the families of pores corresponding to the largest micropores and the mesopores of the synthesized MOFs are not connected to the ultramicropores of the materials. The latter proposal is partly supported by the fact that PSM did not change the surface area of the ultramicropores.

This custom Raman-compatible substrate is based on a gold layer that blocks interfering signal from the underlying glass slide . This gold layer is coated with a thin SiO 2 layer that allows the covalent attachment of a PA gel without producing a substantial background signal . This renders the substrates suitable for the construction of the aforementioned microarray platform for screening HSC fate decisions and other types of stem cells with noninvasive Raman spectroscopy. To fabricate the substrates, thermal vapor deposition was used to deposit a 5-nm-thick chromium (Cr) adhesion layer on the glass substrate, followed a 50nm-thick gold (Au) layer. The thickness of each layer was monitored during deposition with a quartz crystal thickness monitor. These layer thicknesses were validated by using X-ray reflectivity, and good agreement was found (Figure ). Then a 100-nm-thick silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) layer was deposited on top of the gold layer using PECVD. Based on use of this fabrication process to create a single batch of substrates, we calculate our cost is $3.35 per substrate, which is approximately 8 times less expensive than the commercially available (Thorlabs) protected gold mirror substrate (Table ). Of course, the cost would further decrease for both academic and nonacademic users if multiple batches were fabricated at a time.

As a result, MOF properties sensitive to ML interactions have the potential to become size-dependent. Recent evidence was documented in a report on the temperature dependence of archetypical MOFs with particle sizes ranging from 20 nm -4 \u00b5m. As determined by VT-DRUVVis, all materials displayed decreasing optical gaps with increasing temperatures. Although conventional semiconductors typically show this \"Varshni behaviour\", the effect in MOFs was much more severe. For TiO2, Si, and similar materials, optical gaps decrease by roughly 0.1 eV over a 300 K range, whereas the MOF nanoparticles (nanoMOFs) absorbed at photon energies nearly 1 eV below the original low-temperature optical gap. The magnitude of this effect depends on the lability of the MOF ML bonds, however. As an example, the relatively dynamic titanium-carboxylate bonds in MIL-125 (Ti8O8(OH)4(terephthalate)6) led to a large but reversible decrease of ~600 mV over a range of 300 K, whereas ZIF-8 (Zn(2-methylimidazolate)2), comprised of strong zinc-imidazolate bonds, shows a much smaller decrease of only ~10 mV.

Therefore, quantitative regulation of temporal PINK1 recruitment to the mitochondria could provide valuable insights into the mechanism that determines the fate of damaged mitochondria. HeLa cells stably expressing Halo-OMP25 and pSu9-mEGFP were transfected to transiently express cytPINK1-mOrange2-eDHFR and miRFP670nano-Parkin and were treated with 7 \u03bcM pcDH. Then, we temporarily recruited cytPINK1-mOrange2-eDHFR to the MOM by violet light illumination for a certain period and returned cytPINK1 back to the cytosol by subsequent green light illumination (Fig. ). Through violet light illumination, a portion of the cytPINK1 protein was transiently localized on the MOM for 30 min, 10 min, 3 min, or 1 min (Extended Data Fig. ). Although 30-min and 10-min cytPINK1 localization on the MOM induced the accumulation of Parkin on the mitochondria in most cells, shortening the anchoring time of cytPINK1 to 3 min or 1 min significantly depleted Parkin accumulation (Fig. ). Time-course analysis of the PCC values indicating the mitochondrial localization of the target proteins showed that the accumulation of Parkin on the MOM was accelerated during the transient localization of cytPINK1 on the MOM (Fig. ).

The O=C\u2022\u2022Xe angle from MP2+\u03b4(T) is almost identical with the r SE e structure. The OCS monomer in the r SE e structure is only slightly distorted from the equilibrium values, with a 0.2 \u2022 inward bend. This leads us to two conclusions: i) the OCS monomer remains at near-equilibrium values, and the significant deviations of the OCS moiety from its equilibrium shape in both r m structures can be attributed to the fitting process, and ii) an effect unaccounted for in the MP2+\u03b4(T) method leads to a larger monomer separation in the experimental results.As 7 isotopologues of the Ne\u2022 \u2022 \u2022OCS complex have been measured by Xu and Gerry, 6 it is possible to apply the above fitting process to that set of rotational constants.

This information is contained within the Hessian matrix, some (or all) of which must be known to step towards a saddle point. Optimization to a first order saddle point requires stepping uphill on the potential energy surface in the direction of the reaction coordinate and downhill in all other directions. We define the reaction coordinate as the direction in which the curvature is smallest (most negative or least positive), which is by construction the leftmost eigenvector of the Hessian matrix. Therefore it is at least necessary to know this eigenvector to step towards a first order saddle point.For molecular saddle point optimization, it is common to evaluate the full Hessian matrix at least once at the beginning of optimization. Many electronic structure theory methods such as Hartree-Fock and DFT have efficient analytical Hessian implementations. Additionally, transformation of Cartesian Hessians into internal coordinates is straightforward. When using a level of theory for which efficient analytical second derivatives are not available, the Hessian matrix is usually evaluated in full using finite difference. For computationally expensive levels of theory or for very large molecules, the evaluation of the initial Hessian matrix may become more costly than all subsequent geometry optimization steps. Even when using levels of theory with efficient analytical second derivatives, evaluation of the Hessian matrix will eventually dominate the overall cost of optimization as system sizes grow larger due to the higher computational scaling of Hessian evaluations relative to gradient evaluations.

Hence, taken together, our results suggest that a \"classic\" proton-shuttling model may be eligible to describe the HCOOH adsorption on defect-free portions of anatase TiO 2 {101} surfaces at room temperature. A third remark, which is more chemical in nature, is that both the quantum and the classical picture predict that HCOOH on top of TiO 2 anatase is essentially a neutral moiety (see Bader charges in Table in the SI) with its acid functionality \"protected\" by the surface, owing to the presence of a strong hydrogen bond. Thus, its reactivity may be substantially different from that of a fully-dissociated formic acid -i.e. an adsorbed negatively charged formate and a Br\u00f8nsted acid surface site formed upon protonation of TiO 2 (101) anatase. Indeed, the \"protecting-group\" role of the surface highlighted by our study might explain, for example, why, carboxylic acids pre-adsorbed on TiO 2 nanoparticles undergo amidation instead of salt formation upon addition of amines. Conclusions By using first principles approaches we propose a model for the adsorption of light carboxylic acids on regular {101} surfaces of TiO 2 -anatase: the adsorbate is bound to a Ti-Lewis acid centre via a carboxyl oxygen, and to a surface oxygen via a \"floating\" proton, with the surface acting like a protecting group for the carboxylic acid functionality, owing to the presence of a short hydrogen bond (HB). This model accounts for the peculiar reactivity of adsorbed carboxylic acids upon addition of amines. The novelty of this picture, which is consistent with spectroscopic experiments, is a dynamical model of the adsorbed moiety, involving either a rapid proton shuttling between a carboxylic and a surface oxygen, or a proton sharing between these two atoms due to quantum delocalization.

It provides a basis for the quantum mechanical applications of information theory.How can one determine the state of the system leading to events that are most probable and therefore reproducible by repeated experiments? The maximal entropy approach seeks to reconstruct the density matrix of the system in its most probable state in a situation of incomplete knowledge, when only partial information about the system is available. The commonly discussed scenario is when we know N mean values for a set of operators typically called the constraints. In general this set of expectation values is not sufficient to uniquely determine the state. Among all density operators that are consistent with the given mean values of the constraints we select the one (unique) density of whose entropy is maximal.This density operator is represented as an exponential function of those operators whose mean values are given. For this density matrix, the surprisal is a linear function of the operators that are the constraints with coefficients that are the Lagrange multipliers that arise in seeking a maximum of the entropy subject to constraints. The linearity of the surprisal as a function of the constraints is especially convenient when the operators do not commute and an exponential form in the operators calls for special handling, e.g., Ref. 22.An established route for the computation of the dynamical evolution of the surprisal is via an algebraic procedure for the dynamics of the constraints in the Heisenberg picture. The equations of motion for the constraints are derived using their commutation relation with the Hamiltonian and can be solved analytically if the set of \nQuestion:\n Why is the maximal entropy approach used to determine the state of a system when only partial information is available?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The maximal entropy approach is used because it allows for the reconstruction of the density matrix of the system in its most probable state in situations of incomplete knowledge.

But little information exists on how the interorganelle crosstalk impacts cancer cells due to the lack of approaches that manipulate inter-organelle communication in cancer cells. We unexpectedly found that a negatively charged, enzyme cleavable peptide enables the trafficking of histone protein (H2B), a nuclear protein, to the mitochondria in cancer cells. The peptide, denoted as MitoFlag, interacts with the nuclear location sequence (NLS) of H2B to block it entering nucleus. A protease on the mitochondria cleaves the Flag from the complex of MitoFlag and H2B to form assemblies that retain H2B on the mitochondria and facilitate the H2B entering mitochondria. Molecular validation of MitoFlag shows that adding NLS, replacing aspartic acid residues by glutamic acid residues, or changing L-aspartic acid to D-aspartic residue abolishes the trafficking of H2B into mitochondria of HeLa cells. As the first example of enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) of a synthetic peptide for trafficking endogenous proteins, this work provides insights for understanding and manipulating inter-organelle communication in cells. \nQuestion:\n How does the peptide MitoFlag enable the localization of histone H2B to mitochondria in cancer cells?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The peptide MitoFlag interacts with the nuclear location sequence of H2B to prevent it from entering the nucleus.

For C 16 H 34 variations between the different theory levels are larger and only the GFN2 conformational entropy for the folded conformer as reference is still within chemical accuracy. Nevertheless, accurate entropies of extremely flexible large alkanes have been consistenly obtained for the first time and this can be considered as a major achievement even though some issues for C 18 H 38 remain. The detailed reasons for the deviations for the \"worst cases\" C 16 H 34 and particularly C 18 H 38 are not fully clear at this point but originate tentatively from the S conf part.Technical size limitations of our approach should also be noted. The computational cost increases strongly with molecule size at high flexibility and can make the conformational entropy calculation unfeasible for larger molecules. At the GFN2 level, the S conf calculation for C 16 H 34 already takes a few hundred hours of computation time, and hence, we did not attempt to calculate C 18 H 38 at this level of theory.

Somewhat larger (up to 100-200 atoms) but less flexible molecules (e.g., typical drugs, see Sec.4.4) are also feasible at the GFN-FF level due to the shorter MD run times required.

In the unit cell, each COF layer is comprised of one triazine, one boroxine, and three benzene rings, and the two layers are stacked directly on top of each other (eclipsed stacking). The reason for this combination of building units is to maximize the environment of different TM atoms and organic rings, while maintaining synthesis feasibility which can explore the effects of TM atoms in the different rings. Seven different types of TM-intercalated 2D bilayer COFs were computationally prepared through the addition of TMs at the centroid of the bilayer COF rings:\u2022 2D-COF-TM-01a. One TM per unit cell, intercalated at the centroid of the boroxine rings.\u2022 2D-COF-TM-01b. One TM per unit cell, intercalated at the centroid of the triazine rings.\u2022 2D-COF-TM-02.

Therefore, a total of one pristine structure and sixty-three intercalated bilayer structures were generated. Additionally, a trilayer V-05/V-05 2D COF structure was generated by adding another intercalated COF layer to the previously-optimized V-05 bilayer.

Owing to their large, three-dimensional hydrophobic surfaces, SOPS (1a-i) have much greater solubility in organic solvents than TPP (2), as seen in Table . There were also noticeable differences in solubility between the series of aliphatic SOPS and the series  of aromatic SOPS; these differences were used to our advantage in the purification process (see Supporting Information). The improved solubilities of the SOPS compared to 2 can be rationalized by considering the non-covalent interactions between the molecules in the solid state. Porphyrins that lack axial capping groups, such as 2, are known to experience favorable face-toface aromatic interactions between their large, exposed \u03c0-surfaces. These interactions cause aggregation, which in turn can red-shift absorption and quench fluorescence. On the other hand, analysis of the packing structures of 1f-i (see Supporting Information, Figures , 46, and 48) shows that the bulky axial caps prevent this interaction. As an illustrative example, there are three molecules near the axial cap of 1h (Figure ), but none come into close contact with the surface of the porphyrin ring system itself; they contact the cap instead. A Hirshfeld surface plot of 1h (Figure ) and interaction energy calculations (see Supporting Information, Tables S3-12 and Figures ) confirm that these interactions between the neighboring molecules are dominated by van der Waals forces. The SOPS contact one another at distances that correspond closely to the sum of the respective van der Waals radii, as can be seen by the large areas of white in the Hirshfeld \nQuestion:\n How does the solubility of SOPS compare to that of TPP in organic solvents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: SOPS have much greater solubility in organic solvents than TPP.", "weight": 1}]}

This result is reasonable for SF in solution,as the triplet excitons are able to separate easily as molecules diffuse away from each other, and so any intermediate species would be short-lived. The extracted concentrations of S 1 and T 1 of TIPS-Pn from this fit are shown in Fig. (a). The lower bound of the triplet concentration comes from the upper bound of the T 1 basis spectrum. This result corresponds to the upper bound on the S 1 concentration. The yield of triplet excitons at 8 ns was calculated as c T 1 (8 ns)/c S 1 (0 ns) and is between 19 and 27%.For 8 mM TIPS-Tn, the deconvolution fits reproduce the TA data well at all wavelengths and times (Figs. S23 and S24 of the supplementary material). As with TIPS-Pn, a third component is unnecessary to fit the data at this concentration. This result is in apparent contradiction to TA data of TIPS-Tn in toluene by and Dover et al. , who resolved an excimer component from the TA data in addition to the triplet and singlet excitons. As will be discussed in more detail later, this disagreement is potentially explained by the significantly higher concentration of 300 mM used in these studies (37.5 times higher than the 8 mM solution used here). We speculate that this concentration may begin to approach the solubility limit of TIPS-Tn in toluene and result in the formation of aggregates in solution. Excimers potentially result from this aggregate formation, and are therefore undetected in more dilute solutions. The resulting concentrations of S 1 and T 1 are shown in Fig. 3(b), where the upper bound of T 1 and lower bound of S 1 concentrations correspond to the lower bound of the T 1 basis spectrum.

A limiting factor is the high C-H bond dissociation energy in methane compared to the partially oxidized products, which leads to overoxidation. Instead, energy-intensive routes that first produce syngas from methane at very high operating temperatures and pressures are customarily used in industry. Living systems leverage metalloenzymes such as soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) to convert methane selectively into methanol under ambient conditions using molecular oxygen as the oxidant 11-13 by forming, for example, a mononuclear Fe(IV)=O species that activates methane.

Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP, 2) was synthesized by the Adler-Longo method. 3b Previous methodology for accessing PorSils relied on the use of a highly reactive lithium amide to deprotonate the porphyrin prior to reaction with HSiCl3, which was found to be a better porphyrin silylating reagent than the perhaps more intuitive building block SiCl4. Sun and co-workers found that porphyrin silylation could be accomplished by combining the porphyrin and HSiCl3 in the presence of Pr3N. They relied on chromatography to purify the resulting TPP-Si(Cl)2 (2-SiCl2), an inefficient approach that also notably did not work in our hands as the modified porphyrin covalently reacted with the solid support. We accomplished the silylation of 2 using HSiCl3 with Et3N, a common laboratory reagent (Scheme 1). After aqueous workup, residual Et3N can be readily removed by evaporation. Using this method we were able to avoid the necessity for chromatography, and instead were able to isolate our desired product by simple liquid-liquid extraction, resulting in up to an 85% yield of 2-SiCl2. The generalization of this reaction in combination with the simplification of the purification procedure are steps forward for the prospects of developing this class of molecules. To synthesize the SOPS, 2-SiCl2 was converted quantitively to 3 by refluxing in a THF/water mixture, and subsequently silylated using Et3N and the respective silyl chloride (Scheme 1). These final compounds were air-stable and purified by column chromatography using silica gel and alkaline eluents (see Supporting Information); large scale purification could be accomplished by recrystallization.It is worth commenting on the more practical aspects of this synthesis, particularly in reference to key intermediate \nQuestion:\n By which method was Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP, 2) synthesized?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The Adler-Longo method", "weight": 1}]}

As in Section 2.1, the ONETEP linear-scaling DFT software is used to compute the ground state electron density of the five proteins, and assign the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters from the partitioned atomic electron densities. Consistent with the QUBE small molecule approach, every atom in the protein is assigned bespoke non-bonded parameters derived from the quantum mechanical electron density. To model polarization effects in the condensed phase, the electron density is computed first in vacuum, then using an implicit solvent model with a dielectric constant of 80. The iPol approach used in AMBER ff15ipq is then employed, with all non-bonded parameters set halfway between their vacuum and condensed phase values. The purpose of this approach, as well as overcoming issues associated with closing of the electronic band gap in large system sizes, is to account for electrostatics and induction in the condensed phase in an effective manner using a fixed point charge force field.

The quality of the Raman spectra acquired from individual, living cells on these custom substrates allowed us to accurately identify the differentiation states of primary murine cells from the two most immature HSC populations using PLS-DA of single-cell Raman spectra. Thus, the inexpensive custom Raman-compatible substrate developed herein brings us a step closer to the construction of a microarray screening platform for the non-invasive screening of stem cell fate decisions elicited by extrinsic cues. Such a platform would likely facilitate the expansion of HSCs in vitro for clinical applications. These substrates may also be employed to construct microarray platforms for noninvasively screening the dynamic responses of other types of stem cells to stimuli using Raman spectroscopy.

Among designed QAPs, spQAPs proved to be the most informative, thus this type of representation was investigated the most. It appears that in some cases enriching atom pairs with information derived from quantum chemistry improves the accuracy of the models relative to traditional atom pairs.Considering regression tasks, based on figures 1 and 2 representing R 2 and RMSE respectively, the overall impression is that the best models' performance is achieved with molecular descriptors, then spQAP and then unmodified atom pairs. Only in the case of predicting pIC50, the most informative molecular representation were atom pairs. Another exception was ionization energy, as Morgan fingerprints and RDKit fingerprints were better suited to create structure-property relationships.In order to gain more insight into the differences in metrics obtained with spQAP and atom pairs, the relative metrics were calculated as the ratio of metric value obtained with spQAP to the value obtained with atom pairs minus 1. The ratio was calculated for each cross validation fold and visualized in figures 3 and 4. The quantum modification of atom pairs caused an average value of R 2 increase from 0.5% to 6% and the RMSE decreased about 0.5% to 5% depending on the predicted property.

U Mann-Whithney test confirmed that in 3 cases the results obtained in cross-validation folds were significantly different. In contrast to quantum chemical calculations of whole molecules and applying them as molecular descriptors, the generation of quantum atom pairs is a rapid and easy process.Although boosting standard atom pairs with quantum information, the number of quantum atom pairs is limited and further research to overcome the problem should be conducted.A possible solution could be the creation of a larger database of quantum properties that would contain molecules build of more chemical elements than QM9-extended-plus database.Other modifications of the quantum atom pairs could be achieved by calculating more than 1 .1a sum of the quantum properties of atom pairs present in the molecule -11 descriptors (sumQAP), 2. a sum of the histograms of the atom pairs -110 descriptors per molecule (hQAP), 3. a vector of quantum properties of atom pairs -11979 values (spQAP) Figure 1 :Figure 2 :12Figure 1: R of regression tasks modelling.

However, these well-known microporous materials could see restricted their applications in heterogeneous catalysis if large reactants exceed their pore sizes leading to unavailable surface areas. In this work, we studied the effect of acetic acid concentration, used as the modulator, on the formation of micro/mesoporous materials. This inclusion of a modulator during synthesis and its removal by activation process generate materials with missing linker defects. We showed that an increase in the concentration of modulator leads to an improvement of calculated apparent surface area and a modification of MOF-808 pore structure by producing mesopores at the expense of micropores. Furthermore, we performed a post-synthetic modification of the MOF-808. We observed the expected sulfation of the zirconium oxo-cluster but also the sulfonation of the organic ligand. Also, we found that only the families of mesopores and the larger micropores are interconnected within the material, and the ultramicropores seems to be isolated from the porous structure. The PSM process led to the addition of Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acid sites to the MOF-808. Experimental results were complemented by theoretical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations.

In the first step, the DNA-I hybridizes with one of two complementary fragments; the hybridization of the 5'-phosphate abasic containing fragment IIaP to the DNA-I is shown in the scheme in Figure . Next, the other fragment IIb hybridizes forming a ternary complex. The T4 DNA ligase present in the solution can ligate the ternary complex to generate the product duplex.

ZrOCl2\u20228H2O (0.2417 g, 0.75 mmol) and the corresponding quantity of modulator were dissolved in 4 mL of dimethylformamide and stirred for 15 min. Trimesic acid (0.0525 g, 0.25 mmol) was dissolved in 4 mL of DMF and added dropwise to the initial solution. The mixture was stirred for additional 10 min.

The as-synthesized Zr-MOFs were filtered and washed once with DMF and twice with both methanol and acetone. The resulting powder was dried at 80\u00b0C for 2 h. A selected Zr-MOF was post-synthetically modified adapting the procedure presented by Jiang et al. . Briefly, 50 mg of the synthesized material was treated with 50 mL of 0.05 M sulfuric acid (2.5 mmol) for 24 h. After that, the solution was solvent exchanged with 50 mL of water for three days; with the water being changed once a day, quickly exchanged with 50 mL of acetone and immersed in 50 mL of chloroform for three days. During this time, chloroform was exchanged once per day. Finally, all the synthesized materials were activated overnight at 110 \u00b0C under a vacuum pressure of 0.05 mbar.

We showed in our previous work on the sulfenylation of aryl chlorides that the reaction most likely proceeds through a Ni(0)/Ni(II) mechanism and acetate-assisted deprotonation of thiols, which is also plausible for the reaction of triflates (Scheme 5). The activation of the precatalyst, which is structurally related to the product of the oxidative addition, occurs via the same steps as the catalytic reaction (coordination of thiol, deprotonation and reductive elimination of the thioether). Interestingly, the reaction progress comparison of different electrophiles showed that aryl triflates not only have the highest reaction rate, but also the shortest induction period < 5 minutes (Scheme 6). It indicates a fast catalyst activation, which might be explained by a substrate assisted reductive elimination. This underlines the superiority of aryl triflates as electrophiles in this reaction.

In both cases we found two free energy minima, corresponding to the dissociated (Figure ) and nondissociated (Figure ) forms. In Figure , the same profiles are reported in units of kT as well. It emerges that at room temperature the shuttling barrier is of the order of kT, hence the shuttling process should be thermally accessible. Indeed, temperature does affect quantitatively the free energy profile: while at 50 K we obtain a free energy barrier of 0.84 kcal/mol, at 300 K the barrier is 1.17 kcal/mol. However, in terms of kT, the barrier amounts to 2.0 kT at 300K while it raises to 8.5 kT at 50 K: hence, overall the shuttling process would be favored upon increasing the temperature. Also, temperature copes to reduce the thermodynamic stability difference between the dissociated and undissociated forms (which is 6.4 kT at 50 K and 0.9 kT at 300 K).Starting from relevant configurations of the 50 K free energy profile, we calculated energy minima (at 0 K) by geometry optimizations at different levels of theory.

The most common types of internal coordinates are the two-atom bond distances, three-atom bending angles, and four-atom dihedral angles. A sufficiently large set of these three types of internal coordinates can fully represent all internal degrees of freedom of a molecule. To facilitate automation, our algorithm is capable of automatically determining an appropriate set of internal coordinates. Notably, the algorithm handles systems with linear bending angles by replacing those coordinates with alternate coordinates, adding dummy atoms where necessary. Without this functionality, optimization algorithms in internal coordinates will often crash due to derivative discontinuities in bending angle degrees of freedom.There are many ways to construct an internal coordinate system for a molecule.Perhaps the simplest approach is the Z-matrix representation, which defines a minimal internal coordinate system. However, the Z-matrix representation necessarily omits chemically relevant features for non-trivial molecules, particularly molecules with rings.This has a deleterious effect on performance, as the excluded chemically relevant features may change drastically after even a small displacement in the Z-matrix coordinate space. For this reason, our algorithm uses a redundant internal coordinate system that includes all chemically relevant bond stretch, angle bend, and dihedral angle coordinates.Redundant internal coordinate systems increase the complexity of the optimization \nQuestion:\n What are the benefits and drawbacks of using a redundant internal coordinate system and the Z-matrix representation in molecular geometry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The redundant internal coordinate system includes all chemically relevant bond stretch, angle bend, and dihedral angle coordinates, which can increase the complexity of the optimization.

The main disadvantage of transporting hydrogen via tube trailers is the high cost of transported hydrogen: a single tube trailer can only carry approximately 400 kg of hydrogen, and the limitation lies in the weight of the steel tubes used as well as in the maximum allowable storage pressure in tube trailers (250 bar in the U.S.). One of the proposals that has recently gained significant attention in the hydrogen world is to repurpose the existing natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure. Transporting hydrogen in a network that has already been commissioned would bring significant advantages including 1) a short(er) time horizon for the development of a large-scale hydrogen transport infrastructure, 2) significantly lower capital expenditures (CAPEX) of the transport system for hydrogen, and 3) to bring freedom and certainty to stakeholders on both the consumption and production sides of hydrogen, so that they can develop projects where they deem it best suited to their interests.The retrofitting of the existing natural gas infrastructure to accommodate hydrogen comes with challenges of its own. As a first example, there could be competition with natural gas. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that natural gas will continue to play a role in the global energy mix, both in the lead up to 2050 and potentially beyond. This implies that hydrogen and natural gas could compete with one another for access to the transport infrastructure; in principle, this could be solved by physically blending hydrogen in the natural gas, albeit blending \nQuestion:\n Which method of transporting hydrogen, using tube trailers or repurposing the existing natural gas infrastructure, is associated with lower capital expenditures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Repurposing the existing natural gas infrastructure is associated with significantly lower capital expenditures compared to using tube trailers.", "weight": 1}]}

On the contrary, photocatalysts such as Ru(phen)3Cl2 and Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2, one of the most important photocatalyst that launched the entire field of photoredox catalysis, exhibits fairly poor quenching with most substrates, which explains its decline in usage against more reactive Ir photocatalysts.In conclusion, we demonstrated the use of a highthroughput workflow for the measurements of Stern-Volmer quenching constants using commercially available fluorescence plate readers and 96-well plates. We validated the method by comparing the results to reported quenching values. Automatization of the liquid dispensing step allowed for the rapid preparation and analysis of the Stern-Volmer quenching for a collection of common photocatalysts and quenchers. We believe this workflow enables a consistent and rapid collection of quenching constants with readily available instrumentation, thereby finally bringing Stern-Volmer studies to the same level of high throughput capabilities as those for reaction discovery for photoredox catalysis.

However, Dimotakis has found for a wide variety of flows, including shear layers and jets, that a Reynolds number based on the Taylor microscale can be used to determine when fully-developed turbulence is achieved . Fully-developed turbulence requires a minimum Taylor Reynolds number of approximately 100 to 140. For the azo-coupling experiments, the Taylor Reynolds number ranged from 20 to 171. Fully-developed turbulence was only achieved for five out of 29 results and those results were for relatively thick single sheets (250 to 1300 \u00b5m) at large mixed-sheet flow rates to 76 L/min). Thus, the Kolmogorov microscale was used for some of the results where the flow was not fully-developed turbulence. Further, the azocoupling study was unable to correlate the Reynolds number with the micromixing other than a general statement regarding laminar flow, transition flow and fully-developed turbulence.The azo-coupling micromixing study investigated a wide range of mixed sheet flow rates (2.8 to 76 L/min) but only at a single impingement angle of 30 degrees. In addition, the low-flowrate experiments (2.8 to 5.6 L/min) studied viscosities ranging from 1 to 12 cP. Calculated energy dissipation rates ranged from 6.2 x 10 3 to 1.2 x 10 6 W/kg. In this study, the micromixing resulting from impinging sheets was studied by following the neutralization of dilute aqueous NaOH with dilute aqueous HCl using a fluorescent indicator. The fluorescence intensity along a radial line in the mixed sheet was measured from photographs using ImageJ software . From the fluorescence intensity vs time profiles, the diffusive slab thickness was determined and related to dissipation microscales of turbulence as well as the Reynolds number.

Furthermore, PL lifetimes measured at the respective Ln 3+ emission peaks in 1 and 2 upon exposure to NO2 confirm that the lifetime of 1 drops from 197 to 126 \u00b5s, whereas no significant effect of NO2 adsorption on the PL lifetime is observed in 2 (see Figures ). These observations strongly suggests that NO2 adsorption does not lead to changes in the first coordination sphere around the Ln 3+ ion. Thus, a molecular absorption of NO2 by the ligand should be expected.AB INITIO CALCULATIONS. To understand the nature of the NO2 interactions with the Ln-MOF, DFT calculations , have been performed. A total of 8 different configurations of the NH2 groups within the MOF were considered for 1 and 2 in order to account for the fractional occupation of the amino site reported experimentally (Fig. ). The electrostatic potential energy map of the bare MOF was computed for each configuration in order to find the NO2 binding location.The NO2 molecule was placed in regions of highly attractive potential within the unit cell and a full geometrical optimization was performed (see section S11). This procedure has allowed us to correctly predict in the past the location of adsorbate CO2 molecules within a MOF in absence of experimental guidance. Remarkably, despite the fact that the starting NO2 is near the metal site (see section S9 and Figure for information), the final configuration always converges to the NO2 being located within the pore near the NH2 groups.Specifically, the NO2 binds \nQuestion:\n What is the step before a full geometrical optimization in the process of understanding NO2 interactions with the Ln-MOF?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The NO2 molecule was placed in regions of highly attractive potential within the unit cell", "weight": 1}]}

In the former case, there is a cluster of data near d GDS = 0, consistent with the surface propensity of I -(aq), however the corresponding VIEs are spread over a range that is not dissimilar from the spread of the entire data set. This is consistent with the similarity between bulk and interfacial VIE distributions that was documented in Fig. . It is difficult to see any correlations at all in the n HB versus VIE data. While transient fluctuations in the hydrogen-bond network are no doubt the origin of the inhomogeneous broadening of the VIE distribution, it is not so simple as saying that fewer hydrogen bonds to the ion implies a larger or smaller VIE, especially with a metric that discretizes the ion's hydra- tion shell into an integer number of hydrogen bonds.In previous MD simulations of halide ions A -(aq) at the air/water interface, Jungwirth and Tobias reported that the larger halides exhibit distinctive differences in terms of how their ion-water hydrogen bonds are oriented with respect to the surface normal, when compared to the same ions in bulk water.

However, in the recent years there has been a growing interest in studies of Cu(III) complexes as intermediates in cross-coupling reactions and in biological systems. Moreover, very recently Cu(III) macrocyclic complexes with labile monodentate ligands (F, CN, ONO) were successfully used in radical C-H functionalization processes. Among known Cu(III) compounds, trifluoromethyl complexes are exceptionally stable species. Neutral complexes with bidentate N-donor ligands such as (bpy)Cu(CF3)3 (Grushin's reagent) and (phen)Cu(CF3)3 were shown to serve as unique C-H trifluoromethylation reagents of radical or radical-polar crossover type. C-H trifluoromethylation of arenes, alkenes, alkynes, and C(sp 3 )-H bonds using the Grushin's reagent or its analogues was demonstrated recently, including the latestage functionalization of biomolecules. In contrast to rapid emergence of applications of Cu(III) trifluoromethyl complexes in organic chemistry, the structural variety of these compounds is very narrow. Nearly all of the applications are based on N-donor Cu(III)-CF3 complexes, very similar in reactivity and properties. Thus, investigation of organometallic chemistry of high-valent copper is an important task. Very recently, we discovered novel Cu(III) 1,3-diketonate complexes bearing only two trifluoromethyl groups, such as (acac)Cu(CF3)2 and (dbm)Cu(CF3)2, which displayed high reactivity in direct C-H \nQuestion:\n Why has there been a growing interest in studies of Cu(III) complexes in recent years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: There has been a growing interest in studies of Cu(III) complexes as intermediates in cross-coupling reactions and in biological systems.", "weight": 1}]}

Evidence for dynamic ML bond equilibria in MOFs was recently reported as VT-DRIFTS spectra for a series of archetypical carboxylate MOFs. The observed red-shift in the vibrational frequencies of the symmetric and asymmetric C-O stretches suggested the coexistence of \"tight\" and \"loose\" states in thermal equilibrium. This nomenclature was adopted over \"bound\" and \"unbound\" because previously reported molecular dynamics simulations 26 revealed that MOF ML bonds dynamically fluctuate between conformations with a wide range of bond lengths and angles. Accordingly, carboxylate MOFs were interpreted to exist in an equilibrium between two shallow and wide potential energy surfaces that encompass of diverse collections of tightly or loosely bound ML states. The relative abundances of the \"tight\" and \"loose\" states can be extracted by fitting two fixed Gaussians to these data at different temperatures, permitting quantification of a \"flexibility\" constant (ln Kflex, Kflex = [loose]/[tight]), defined as the inverse of the familiar formation constants Kf reported for molecular complexes. In HKUST-1 (Fig. and), an ln Kflex of ~0.3 was observed at room temperature, which compares well to values reported for discrete metal complexes such as zinc and copper benzoates/acetates in the range of 0.1-1.5. This analysis also suggests that unbound states likely comprise a significant portion of MOF structures. To gain insight into the thermodynamics of this equilibrium, Van't Hoff analysis of VT-DRIFTS data of HKUST-1 was performed to assess the temperature dependence of Kflex. This result suggests that the population of loose states is associated with a small endothermic barrier (\u0394H = 5.9 \u00b1 0.2 kJ mol -1 ), overcome by an increase in entropy (\u0394S = 22.0 \u00b1 0.6 J mol -1 \nQuestion:\n Why do the vibrational frequencies of the symmetric and asymmetric C-O stretches in carboxylate MOFs exhibit a red-shift?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The red-shift in the vibrational frequencies of the symmetric and asymmetric C-O stretches in carboxylate MOFs is suggested to be due to the coexistence of 'tight' and 'loose' states in thermal equilibrium.

A comparison of the QUBE and OPLS non-bonded parameters for ubiquitin is shown in Figure . Figures for the other proteins tested follow similar trends.

UPS and NEXAFS show that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of the alternant molecule pyrene, and theory predicts a very similar difference of 0.87 eV. The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding an even larger difference of 1.09 eV. One reason why this difference is larger for azupyrene is due to symmetry selection rules, which result in a forbidden HOMO\u2192LUMO transition and the lack of fluorescence for azupyrene. These special properties of azupyrene's electronic structure are related to the nonalternant topology of its \uf070-electron system. The topology of azupyrene also leads to a more localized charge distribution, visible in the experimental XPS and NMR shifts as well as in the DFT-calculated partial charges, all showing a negative charge surplus at the apices of the 7-membered rings and positive charge at the central C2-unit. The conjugated system of pyrene is best described as a biphenyl with two ethenediyl bridges, whereas azupyrene is a [14]annulene with a central double-bonded C2 unit. This interpretation follows from HOMA considerations, bond length changes, and the vibrational modes seen in experimental and calculated IR spectra. Overall, we found that the topology of the \uf070electron system drastically influences the electronic structure of the two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Those differences in electronic structure are reflected in the absorption and fluorescence behavior, a lower electron-hole binding energy, and a lower barrier to electron-hole separation for azupyrene. The possible application of nonalternant molecules in organic electronic devices is favored by those differences.

The experimental parameters utilized were as follows: At a temperature of 25\u00b0C, with a catalyst concentration of 300 mg/L, the pH was measured to be 5.2. As depicted in Fig. , elevating initial concentrations resulted in a decrease in removal rates during the initial stages of the process, which aligns with our expectations. As the concentration of dye increases, the removal rate decreases due to a higher number of dye molecules competing with the same quantity of OH . radicals.

Such extremely large flexible systems have not been considered before quantitatively.The experimental entropy values show a strict linear increase with the number of carbon atoms and the reproduction of this relation represents a challenging task for theoretical methods. Both the RRHO as well as the msRRHO models increasingly underestimate the entropy with growing system size leading to a strongly non-linear behavior and errors of more than 20% for the largest alkanes considered. The major part of this difference can be accounted for by S conf . In fact, up to tetradecane (C 14 H 30 ), the computed values are all still within chemical accuracy of 3 cal mol -1 K -1 upon adding the conformational term.However, other effects start to come into play at this system size. The global minimum of C 14 H 30 and of smaller n-alkanes in the gas-phase always correspond to a linear (unfolded) structure. As intramolecular interactions, in particular London dispersion, become stronger with increasing system size, other conformers will be favored eventually. For C 14 H 30 up to C 18 H 38 , a competing folded conformer (in which dispersion interactions are maximized) is observed. The folded conformers are energetically similar to the respective linear structure but differ strongly in their msRRHO entropy. Depending on the applied theoretical level, either conformation could be the global gas-phase minimum, which makes the choice of S ref in Eq. 11 ambiguous and could introduce errors.

The first \uf070* resonance of pyrene has two maxima, which are caused by the C1s\u2192LUMO and C1s\u2192LUMO+1 excitations, as was ascertained by MO-projected NEXAFS simulations (see Figure in the SI and Ref. ). For azupyrene, the individual excitations in the first peak are not resolved, because the corresponding LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals are too close in energy. For both molecules, the MO-projected NEXAFS simulations show that the leading edge of the adsorption peak is determined by the C1s\u2192LUMO excitation.The X-ray absorption edge of azupyrene appears at a lower photon energy by 0.37 eV than that of pyrene, as can be seen in Figure . Since the core-level energies differ only marginally, it can therefore be concluded that the LUMO of azupyrene is lower in energy. Theory also predicts the LUMO of azupyrene to be lower in energy, here the magnitude is 0.60 eV.Combination of the experimental differences of electron addition and removal energies from UPS and NEXAFS data indicate that the electronic band gap is 0.72 eV (= 0.37 eV + 0.35 eV) smaller for azupyrene than for pyrene. For comparison, the calculations yield a value of 0.87 eV for the difference in electronic band gap, which is in good agreement with the experimental finding. In addition, the calculations can provide the absolute electronic band gaps, which are not accessible by the experimental techniques at our disposal. The calculated absolute electronic band gaps are 2.96 eV and 3.83 eV for azupyrene and pyrene, respectively.

Our algorithm implements constrained saddle point optimization by combining null-space SQP with RS-PRFO in this way.It is illustrative to explain how null-space SQP can be implemented into RS-RFO before explaining how to implement it in the RS-PRFO.

The value of \u03b1 is chosen to satisfy our trust region condition, which we describe below. Note that as with the standard SQP minimization method described above, we have replaced the gradient g with the extrapolated gradient gex and the approximate Hessian of the potential energy B with the approximate Hessian of the Lagrangian BL . This will result in a displacement vector s Q which is suitable for use in the null-space SQP minimization formalism.

The TA noise level was determined to be 0.016 mOD, so the maximum triplet absorption at 8 ns is 0.049 mOD. Using the lower bound of the T 1 basis spectrum, this absorption corresponds to a triplet concentration of 1.6 \u00d7 10 -8 M (5.2% of the initial S 1 population). This value is higher than for TIPS-Pn, potentially because the T 1 absorption is both less intense and less distinct from S 1 for TIPS-Tn triplets than for TIPS-Pn triplets, or because some triplets actually form over 8 ns, which contribute to the measured noise. Modeling the 0.05 mM concentration without ISC using a bimolecular SF rate constant of 2.0\u00d710 9 M -1 s -1 gives a T 1 concentration of 3.6\u00d710 -10 M, corresponding to an absorbance of 0.001 mOD (supplementary material Fig. ).If we add in an ISC rate constant of 8.50 \u00d7 10 6 s -1 (time constant of 118 ns) we reach a total T 1 concentration (from ISC and SF) of 1.6 \u00d7 10 -8 M at 8 ns, which matches the noise limit.

The standard deviation of the charge distribution across the ensemble is just 0.02 e, supporting previous observations that the underlying DDEC atoms-in-molecule charges are relatively independent of conformation. It is important to test whether these system-specific force field parameters translate into more accurate protein interactions and dynamics. In this regard, although the conformational preferences of the peptides tested in the previous section are promising, it is not known whether the torsional parameters will continue to be appropriate for use with proteins. As the non-bonded parameters vary with the system studied, the transferability of torsional parameters cannot be readily assumed. To assess this we begin by studying MD simulations of the proteins ubiquitin and GB3.The J coupling errors for ubiquitin and GB3 are summarized in Table . With an overall RMSE of 1.54 Hz, the error using the QUBE force field for ubiquitin is higher than that of OPLS-AA/M, which has an RMSE of 1.12 Hz, but lower than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L with errors of 1.84 Hz and 1.70 Hz respectively. 1 GB3 follows the same trend with an RMSE of 1.10 Hz for the QUBE force field, compared to the error for OPLS-AA/M of 0.90 Hz, whilst OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L both have an error of 1.46 Hz. 1 The J coupling results suggest that whilst the transfer of torsional parameters from dipeptides to proteins may cause some issues, the QUBE force field remains more accurate than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L.

Synthetic strategies have been developed previously for the synthesis of (-)-xyloketal D including a Diels-Alder cycloaddition by Wilson and co-workers, 7 a sequential Michael-addition ketalization sequence by Fl\u00f6rke and coworkers and, more recently, a gold-catalyzed cycloisomerization reported by Sarkar and co-workers in 2013. The latter two syntheses report high diastereoselectivity (19:2 and >20:1, respectively); however, the Michael-addition ketalization yields a mixture of regioisomers and the goldcatalyzed cycloisomerization requires a lengthy precursor synthesis. The approach developed by Wilson and co-workers provided the required o-QM precursor in a single step; however, their conditions for o-QM generation led to a low overall yield due in part to undesired isomerization of the dienophile under the requisite conditions for o-QM formation. Ultimately, this approach provided a 2:1 mixture of the desired chroman ketal and undesired chroman \nQuestion:\n Xyloketal D is a fungal natural product from which species found in the South China Sea?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Xylaria sp.", "weight": 1}]}

While we have previously shown that DDEC charges are not too dependent on small conformation changes, 28 further investigation is needed to establish the utility of QUBE for protein folding simulations.Hence, although we have outlined our roadmap to future improvements, a natural question is: where can the QUBE protein force field be used now (especially given the higher cost of parameterization compared to transferable force fields)?

We identified a relationship between inductive effects and Gibbs free energy. The thermodynamic trends indicated that benzylic alcohols with electron-withdrawing substituents at the C6position were less thermodynamically stable, making these substrates more reactive and prone to generation of an o-QM. This computational data supported our experimental observations. Therefore, we hypothesized that higher yields could be achieved if the reactive benzylic alcohol products were first transformed into more stable benzylic thioethers by interception of intermediate o-QMs with thiophenol. The corresponding thermodynamic analysis of thiophenol adducts 49-53 revealed that, regardless of substitution, the benzylic thioethers are lower in energy than their respective benzylic alcohol precursor (Fig. and Supporting Information Figs. and).

A high HOMA value indicates that this particular path strongly contributes to the aromatic stabilization. It is also possible to consider all \uf070-bonds in the molecule; the corresponding HOMA value is called the overall HOMA value O. If the conjugation path along the perimeter \uf070-bonds of the molecule is considered, this is called the perimeter HOMA value P. Likewise, the HOMA value R for each ring can be calculated separately.For convenience, we also calculated the Excess Perimeter Conjugation (EPC) value, which is defined as EPC = P-O. This parameter indicates whether the molecule shows annulenoid character, i.e., the aromatic conjugation is predominantly on the perimeter of the molecule (high EPC), or benzenoid character, i.e., the conjugation is distributed over the whole molecule equally (low EPC). The results of the HOMA analysis are compiled in Figure .Both molecules comprise 16 \uf070-electrons. A conjugation pathway including all 16 \uf070electrons would be anti-aromatic, according to H\u00fcckel's 4n rule. However, for neither molecule a conjugation path with 16 \uf070-electrons exists and pyrene as well as azupyrene are aromatic, as is proven by the 1 H-NMR shifts (see Figure ). While both molecules are aromatic, the difference between them lies in the different conjugation mechanism leading to the aromatic stabilization.Pyrene has a small EPC value of 0.04, which indicates that no annulenoid conjugation is present. The two apical rings possess higher HOMA values than the two other rings and these rings with the smaller HOMA value have one especially short bond.

Using the rate constants fit to a system with aggregates would overestimate the rates at more dilute, diffusion-limited concentrations. The underestimation of triplet excitons at 8 mM by the Dover model is partially explained by the underestimation of SF and overestimation of excimer formation: if excimers predominantly result from aggregates and are absent at lower concentrations, then collisions at 8 mM are more likely to result in SF, and more triplet formation.Additionally, the presence of aggregates would explain the fast rate of triplet fusion at high TIPS-Tn concentration. If SF at 300 mM occurs on an aggregated pair of TIPS-Tn molecules, then the triplets are not well separated spatially and can recombine quickly. However, in a dilute solution with no aggregates, in which SF occurs during transient collisions, the molecules may diffuse away before the triplets recombine. Therefore the triplet fusion rate would be lower and a more significant amount of triplets would be observed. We note that the presence of aggregates at 300 mM does not affect the main conclusion of the study by Dover et al., i.e., that the excimer is a trap state rather than an intermediate. However, for the remainder of this study, we revert to the much simpler model shown in Eqs. ( ) and ( ) to describe SF in this system.As mentioned previously, we neglect the reverse SF process, triplet fusion, in this model. This assumption is justified in TIPS-Pn, as fusion is energetically uphill. For both TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn, the model fits well without triplet fusion, and so presumably it plays only a minor role. The other assumption made here is that the ISC rate is negligible compared to SF, but, as we show below, this assumption may not necessarily be the case. \nQuestion:\n Why does the presence of aggregates lead to a faster rate of triplet fusion at high concentrations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The presence of aggregates at high concentrations leads to a faster rate of triplet fusion because the triplets are not well separated spatially on an aggregated pair of molecules, allowing them to recombine quickly.

The LUMO energies of CH2=CHNO2, CH2=CHNO and CH2=CHCHO were estimated at 28.0, 33.8 and 49.7 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating larger resonance acceptor ability of NO2 over both NO and CHO groups.

The network Hamiltonian approach to simulating protein aggregation and other molecular self-assembly events has the potential to offer insights to researchers developing targeted therapies to treat protein aggregation diseases or the development of other coarse-grained models for probing potential mechanisms driving the self-assembly of supramolecular assemblies of proteins or other large biomolecules. The results of the present study also offer an improved model for the most naturally abundant 1,2 2-ribbon amyloid fibril topology, which is reflected in the steric zipper motif that is widely reported in amyloid fibril structures . Potential future research directions in this vein include applying this approach to optimizing network Hamiltonian models to explore potential mechanisms for other self-assembly processes: from other supramolecular assemblies of proteins or nucleic acids, to microtubule formation, or perhaps even self-assembly at the cellular level. Other broader impacts of this study are that our methodology may be a useful tool for researchers studying protein aggregation diseases and self-assembly of supramolecular structures. By offering a free open-source software implementation of our methodology for automated parameterization of network Hamiltonian models of self-assembly , the authors aim to lower the barrier to widespread adoption of this simulation methodology for studying self-assembly phenomena.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.

Upon excitation, the photocatalyst can decay back to the ground state in a radiative (via photon emission, i.e. fluorescence or phosphorescence) or non-radiative way (heat) (Figure ). In the presence of increased concentration of a quencher, the photocatalyst excited state can also react via EnT or PET, which will compete with radiative decays and ultimately decrease photon emission (Figure ). The decrease in emission intensity is linked to the concentration of quencher as described by the Stern-Volmer equation (equation 1):\ud835\udc3c 0 \ud835\udc3c = 1 + \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5e \ud835\udf0f 0 [\ud835\udc44] (1)where I0 is the emission intensity in the absence of quencher, I is the intensity in the presence of quencher, kq is the quenching constant, \uf0740 is the excited state lifetime and [Q] is the quencher concentration. The product of kq and \uf0740 is often described as Ksv, the Stern-Volmer constant. KSV can be used to compare quenching rates between different quenchers (Figure ). The knowledge of Ksv and [Q] for all the components of a reaction enables the ranking of quenching power and ultimately identification of the main quencher for the photocatalyst.In a typical Stern Volmer experiment, independent solutions of different concentrations of quenchers and a constant concentration of photocatalyst need to be prepared under a rigorously inert atmosphere, and the excitation intensity of each one must be measured separately to extract I and build the Stern Volmer plot.

As evidenced by VT-DRIFTS, the triazolate vibrational modes displayed temperature dependence.

Interestingly, an inversion in the vibrational redshift was observed at the SCO transition temperature (Fig. ).

Interestingly, when the silyloxy caps are installed we observe Q-band structures more like the metallated porphyrins, with Q2 being the most intense (Figure ).

Owing to their large, three-dimensional hydrophobic surfaces, SOPS (1a-i) have much greater solubility in organic solvents than TPP (2), as seen in Table . There were also noticeable differences in solubility between the series of aliphatic SOPS and the series  of aromatic SOPS; these differences were used to our advantage in the purification process (see Supporting Information). The improved solubilities of the SOPS compared to 2 can be rationalized by considering the non-covalent interactions between the molecules in the solid state. Porphyrins that lack axial capping groups, such as 2, are known to experience favorable face-toface aromatic interactions between their large, exposed \u03c0-surfaces. These interactions cause aggregation, which in turn can red-shift absorption and quench fluorescence. On the other hand, analysis of the packing structures of 1f-i (see Supporting Information, Figures , 46, and 48) shows that the bulky axial caps prevent this interaction. As an illustrative example, there are three molecules near the axial cap of 1h (Figure ), but none come into close contact with the surface of the porphyrin ring system itself; they contact the cap instead. A Hirshfeld surface plot of 1h (Figure ) and interaction energy calculations (see Supporting Information, Tables S3-12 and Figures ) confirm that these interactions between the neighboring molecules are dominated by van der Waals forces. The SOPS contact one another at distances that correspond closely to the sum of the respective van der Waals radii, as can be seen by the large areas of white in the Hirshfeld \nQuestion:\n Why do SOPS have much greater solubility in organic solvents compared to TPP?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The improved solubilities of the SOPS compared to TPP can be rationalized by considering the non-covalent interactions between the molecules in the solid state.

Molecular optimization (both for minima and saddle points) is generally performed in a basis of internal coordinates, which typically comprise bond stretch distances, bending angles, and dihedral angles, as internal coordinates are significantly less energetically correlated than Cartesian coordinates. These chemically relevant features provide a more effective coordinate system for optimization at the cost of additional algorithmic complexity. We have recently developed a new method for realizing displacements in a basis of redundant internal coordinates which dramatically reduces the number of steps required to reach convergence on a minimization benchmark. In this work, we extend this algorithm to optimization of saddle point geometries.Our optimization algorithm is designed to be used in automated frameworks without the need for manual intervention. However, the complexity of optimization in a basis of internal coordinates frequently frustrates attempts at automation. For example, when a bending angle of a molecule becomes linear or nearly linear during the course of optimization, displacement of the bending angle coordinate becomes ill-defined. To solve this problem, it is necessary to redefine the internal coordinate system to replace the linear bending angle with a different coordinate. Occasionally, this may require the addition of fictional \"dummy atoms\" that act as scaffolding off of which the replacement coordinate can be defined. The process of adding dummy atoms and dealing with the \nQuestion:\n Why is it necessary to redefine the internal coordinate system when a bending angle of a molecule becomes linear or nearly linear during optimization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: It is necessary to redefine the internal coordinate system when a bending angle of a molecule becomes linear or nearly linear during optimization because the displacement of the bending angle coordinate becomes ill-defined in such cases.

This reduced distance indicates highly favorable binding between the TMs (Cr, Ti, and V) and benzene rings. On the other hand, structures intercalated with Cu atoms follow the expected proportional increase with the number of intercalated atoms, except for Cu-02 and Cu-03, which have the same ILD of 3.44 \u00c5. A similar phenomenon occurs in Mn-intercalated structures, where Mn-03 (3.45 \u00c5) presents very similar ILD as Mn-02 (3.44 \u00c5). Furthermore, Fe-intercalated structures present an increasing ILD for Fe-01, Fe-02, and Fe-03 configurations; however, there is a decrease from Fe-03(3.46 \u00c5) to Fe-04a (3.39 \u00c5). The only difference between Fe-03 and Fe-04a configurations is an additional Fe atom intercalated at the centroid of boroxine rings; therefore, the decrease in ILD leads us to propose that Fe has a similar affinity to benzene, boroxine, and triazine rings. This is reflected in the binding energies, which are very similar for configurations Fe-03, Fe-04, and Fe-05. This behavior also occurs in Sc-03 and Sc-04a, where the ILD decreases by adding a TM at the centroid of boroxine rings. Interestingly, the Fe and Sc intercalation also have similar binding energy trends for the different concentrations intercalation patterns. On the other hand, Mn-and Ni-intercalations are the only groups that follow the initally-expected trend, where the ILD is proportional to an increasing number of intercalated atoms.

The same \uf06e1 frequency (1511 cm -1 ) is observed for excitations in both transitions (363.8 and 577.0 nm, respectively). This could imply that these bands are two different electronic transitions of the same species. While the ratio between the \uf06e3 band at 1005 cm -1 and the band at 958 cm -1 appears different between 577.0 and 363.8 nm excitation, this could originate from the different excited states used to induce resonance. These spectra can thus be interpreted in two ways. First, only one strongly-coupled H-type species is present in the mixture (species 4), corresponding to a highly twisted/bent lycopene displaying two electronic transitions at 577.0 & 363.8 nm. Alternatively, two strongly-coupled H-type species are present in the sample (species 5 & 6), absorbing at 355 and 568 nm, respectively, with the former packing the lycopene in a somewhat more relaxed conformation than the latter. Species 1, 2 & 3 (as well as species 6 if there) can be assigned to helical organizations of H-type aggregates, which have been shown to produce an absorption redshift depending on the twisting angle .

On the other hand, the possibility of species 4, presenting absorption at 577.0 nm and 363.8 nm, is highly puzzling.

We have performed a joint computational and experimental study on the incorporation of Gd 3+ into AlN, creating a heterostructural alloy Al 1-x Gd x N between rocksalt GdN and wurtzite AlN. First-principles calculations using density functional theory in conjunction with SQS supercells reveal that the critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82. The calculated mixing free energy indicates that at equilibrium conditions and at temperatures below 1000 K, there is a large miscibility gap and only a few percent of Gd can be incorporated in AlN. Higher (effective) temperatures that can be accessed with non-equilibrium growth methods will enable higher Gd incorporation. By exploiting these non-equilibrium growth conditions experimentally via combinatorial RF co-sputtering, we have achieved significantly higher Gd concentrations in the wurtzite phase (x \u2248 0.25) than in previous thin film syntheses and therefore significantly expanded the range of alloys in this new materials system.

Hexahydroxy triphenylene (HHTP) was purchased from ACROS Organics. Copper acetate and HHTP were first dissolved in ethanol (1 mM and 0.1 mM, respectively) and allowed to stir for at least 30 mins at ambient. Phosphatebuffered saline (10x) was used to obtain 0.1x after dilution using distilled water. PFOA was first dissolved in distilled water and allowed to stir overnight before use. PFOS stock solution was used as received. Different concentrations of PFAS were obtained by diluting dissolved PFOA and stock PFOS in PBS.Substrate treatment: Glass substrates with ITO-stripes were first sonicated in water, acetone, and isopropanol successively for 5 mins then dried with pure N2. The cleaned substrates were then treated under UV-ozone lamp for 30 mins. This contrasted with harsher (piranha treatment) alternative which tends to etch away the ITO. Using the more benign surface treatment allowed to pre-determine the film growth area by covering the undesired areas with acrylic tape. The ozone treated substrates were then immediately immersed into the salt solution for film growth.MOF film growth: A 1 mM solution of copper acetate was first pulled over treated substrates and allowed adhere onto the surface for 10 mins. The substrates were then carefully rinsed by dipping in fresh ethanol before being transferred into another container with a 0.1 mM solution of HHTP ligand in ethanol. The ligand exchange on the substrate surface was then allowed to proceed for 20 minutes without disturbance at ambient.

Further, the present approach is free of the additional evaluation cost of the correction PES in the dynamic calculations, as the correction PES is only used to predict the energy difference between low-and high-level computations.It's crucial to sample configurations efficiently from the DFT dataset, as the computational cost is directly determined by the sampling size. In the HC scheme, the grid approach was used to sample points from the low-level dataset. This method is efficient for the tri-atom F + H2 system, but is unfeasible for larger systems due to the exponential growth of the number of data points with the system size. Bowman and co-workers used root mean square (RMS) bond difference between two configurations as the criterion to select points near the equilibrium of stationary points and chose a random integer that indicated their position on a list of the remaining points to select points in other regions, which produced a subset that spans the same range of configurations as the original DFT dataset. A small number of configurations were needed to reproduce the key properties around the equilibrium of the stationary points or along the MEP. However, this sampling method is prohibitively expensive for the title reaction with a large configuration space and it's desirable to sample points efficiently to make the correction PES \u0394VHL-LL converged with fewer high-level energies.It's well known that the NN-based potentials are represented by nonlinear \"non-physical\" functions and have limited extrapolation capabilities. Therefore, in principle, if some regions were not covered well, namely, lacking points, different NN potentials would have large uncertainty for configurations of these regions. Based on this fact, \nQuestion:\n What did Bowman and co-workers use as the criterion to select points near the equilibrium of stationary points?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Root mean square (RMS) bond difference between two configurations", "weight": 1}]}

Therefore we conducted two experiments to investigate the effect of desolvation on the fluorescence properties of DUT-140(Zn). At first, the solvent in the pores of as made DUT-140(Zn) was replaced by acetone. In an in situ experiment, the evaporation of acetone was followed by fluorescence spectroscopy.Figure shows the fluorescence decay during desolvation from acetone. The spectra show two main features: a decrease in fluorescence intensity during desolvation and second, a slight red shift of the fluorescence maximum from about 17,000 cm -1 to about 16,500 cm -1 . Accordingly, there is a change in the fluorescence properties during the desolvation of the material. To examine whether this change is related to a structural change of the material, an in situ PXRD experiment was performed. The contour plot in Figure does not show a shift of the individual reflections with time. Therefore, no structural contraction to another crystalline phase can be assumed for DUT-140(Zn) compared to DUT-49(Zn), showing transition from op to ip phase upon solvent desorption before amorphization. Although all previous experiments clearly indicate that there might be a change in fluorescence due to the structural change of the material, no evidence for this hypothesis can be found from these experiments and the redshift can be attributed to the amorphization and the rupture of some coordination bonds.This behavior is most likely caused by the fine interplay of the lower stability of the zinc paddle wheel unit compared to the copper \nQuestion:\n Why does the fluorescence intensity decrease and the fluorescence maximum shift during the desolvation of DUT-140(Zn)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The decrease in fluorescence intensity and the red shift of the fluorescence maximum during the desolvation of DUT-140(Zn) can be attributed to the amorphization and the rupture of some coordination bonds.

Excellent performance is achieved for all assessed methods with RMSDs and SDs (much) smaller than 0.7 cal mol -1 K -1 . In Fig. , virtually all data points are within an error range of1 cal mol -1 K -1 .The choice of the theoretical level used for the msRRHO calculations seems to be less important as both B97-3c and B3LYP perform well. Looking at the corresponding mean deviations B97-3c tends to slightly overestimate C p while B3LYP shows the opposite trend. This is attributed to the choice of the frequency scaling factor and the cut-off value \u03c4 , which were adjusted for the computation of entropies. Accordingly, the results could be seen as further evidence for the conceptional validity of this treatment.At ambient temperature absolute values of heat capacities are smaller than absolute values for entropies. The corresponding conformational contributions are mostly not the accuracy bottleneck for the heat capacities but can be significant at lower temperatures. For example in the LBH subset, the largest C p,conf values are obtained only for the most flexible systems (n-heptane, n-octane) and even then it accounts only to about 2-3 cal mol -1 K -1 . However, it should be noted that the errors in the standard RRHO treatment will quickly exceed the desired 3 cal mol -1 K -1 range. \nQuestion:\n What are the benefits and drawbacks of using assessed methods and specific computational methods like B97-3c and B3LYP in msRRHO calculations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The assessed methods exhibit excellent performance with RMSDs and SDs significantly smaller than 0.7 cal mol -1 K -1, which is a positive aspect.
