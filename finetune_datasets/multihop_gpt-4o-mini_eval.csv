140,"The benefits of using a method like the Davidson algorithm in the qEOM-UCCSD framework include reduced computational demand for classical diagonalization steps, targeting specific groups of transitions, and extending to higher-energy states or specific transitions. However, drawbacks are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, indicating that the focus is on the advantages of employing this method.","Benefits include a reduced computational demand due to a significantly smaller working Hilbert space and the ability to specifically target groups of transitions or higher-energy states, leading to more efficient state preparation. Drawbacks may include limitations in capturing all possible electronic configurations, as the method focuses only on certain configurations deemed relevant, which could potentially overlook other contributing factors in the excited states.","The convergence of the correlation energy is not so certain, and can be improved in three ways: i) by calculating correlation at a higher level of theory, ii) by using a larger basis set or adding diffuse and/or midpoint functions, or iii) by correlating all electrons in the calculation.",0.1651376146788991,0.0,0.08130081300813008,0.0,0.20276063100137176,0.017512918135531463,0.12280701754385966,0.0,0.06015037593984962,0.0,0.18799376373718069,0.002033235330282086
