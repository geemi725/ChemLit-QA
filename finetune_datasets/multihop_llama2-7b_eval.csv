Future growth optimization may be able to further increase the range of Gd that can be incorporated into AlN. Expanding our computational analysis to Pr 3+ and Tb 3+ , which show similar behavior to Gd 3+ , and comparing ionic size effects with electronegativity for all the cations that have been considered for substitution into AlN allows us to develop design rules for Al 1-x M x N alloys.

34,The SDAC method improves over the previous AC method by providing a better agreement with the 'higher-level' MM method.,"The SDAC method is more effective than the previous method in AP-QM/MM simulations.

Reasoning:
The SDAC method is more effective than the previous method in AP-QM/MM simulations because it is more accurate and efficient.

Supporting Evidence:
[AP-MM/MM simulations show that the SDAC method improves over the previous AC method, since the SDAC dynamics, number of defects, and the shape of the disordered region agrees better with those of the 'higherlevel' MM method than the AC results. 'in the AC method is calculated byR QM Œ∂ MM 1 2 QM Buffer R QM 1 W buf R QM 2R QM Œ∂ = R QM max Œ∏ (Œæ Œ∂ -Œæ QM max ) + Œ∏ (Œæ QM max -Œæ Œ∂ ) √ó Œ∏ (Œæ Œ∂ -Œæ semi min ) f (Œæ Œ∂ ) + Œ∏ (Œæ semi min -Œæ Œ∂ ) f (Œæ semi min )Non-bonded ParametersThe non-bonded components of a molecular mechanics force field aim to describe the quantum mechanical electrostatic, dispersion and exchange-repulsion interactions in a computationally efficient manner.

395,The solubility of a substance that exhibits some degree of dissymmetry is generally greater than that of TPP in organic solvents.,"The solubility of a substance that exhibits some degree of dissymmetry as evidenced by the presence of all four Q bands is generally higher than that of TPP in organic solvents.

Reason:
The presence of all four Q bands in a substance indicates that it has a higher degree of dissymmetry than TPP, which only has two Q bands. This increased dissymmetry is likely to result in a higher solubility in organic solvents, as organic solvents are generally more polar than water and can better interact with the more polar substance.

353,The difference in the monomer separation,"The difference in the monomer separation obtained from MP2+¥(T) and CP-MP2+¥(T) is only 0.001 √Ö.

Explanation:

The context is the electronic structure, optical band gaps, and local charge distribution.

The former has no significant effect on the structure, as the difference in the monomer separation obtained from MP2+¥(T) and CP-MP2+¥(T) is only 0.001 √Ö.

When the effect of correlating all core electrons is added to the MP2+¥(T) potential surface ( ), the minimum in the potential moves even further away from the r m structure is a case of obtaining a correct answer for the wrong reasons.

pyrene from azupyrene, has a remarkable influence on the electronic structure as manifested in the electronic and optical band gaps as well as the local charge distribution.

The effect of increasing basis set size in the ¥(T) component of the MP2+¥(T) recipe is shown in Fig. , in the left panel.

Explanation:

The calculated absolute electronic band gaps are 2.96 eV and 3.83 eV for azupyrene and pyrene, respectively.

In on-surface synthesis, both pyrene and azupyrene are small prototypical building blocks for alternant and nonalternant nanographenes.

The conjugated system of pyrene is best described as a biphenyl with two ethenediyl bridges, whereas azupyrene is a [14]annulene with a central double-bonded C2 unit.

705,The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 3.62 eV.,"The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding an even larger difference of 1.09 eV.

In on-surface synthesis, both pyrene and azupyrene are small prototypical building blocks for alternant and nonalternant nanographenes.

Accordingly, the DFT-calculated electronic band gap of azupyrene increases from 2.96 eV to 3.62 eV. With this value the difference between the DFT-based ""frozen orbital"" electronic band gap and the (experimental) optical band gap is 1.08 eV (= 3.62 eV -2.54 eV) for azupyrene, while the same difference is only 0.20 eV (= 3.83 eV -3.63 eV) for pyrene.

261,The electronic band gap of azupyrene is smaller than that of a substance with a symmetric peak and an optical excitation energy of 3.63 eV.,"The electronic band gap of azupyrene is larger than that of a substance with a symmetric peak and an optical excitation energy of 3.63 eV.

Reasoning:
The electronic band gap of azupyrene is by 0.72 eV smaller than that of pyrene.

The pyrene peak is symmetric and has a smaller width (FWHM = 0.94 eV).

The resulting optical excitation energies, determined from the rising edge of the peak, are 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding a difference of 1.09 eV.

Our ab initio calculations within the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) approach (see vertical lines in Figure ) overestimate the absolute excitation energies for both molecules.

The electronic band gap of azupyrene is larger than that of a substance with a symmetric peak and an optical excitation energy of 3.63 eV.

Comment: I think this is a good answer, but I'm not sure it's the best answer. I think the best answer is that the electronic band gap of azupyrene is larger than that of a substance with a symmetric peak and an optical excitation energy of 3.63 eV.

432,Ammonia poses a higher threat to human health than a substance used for short distance hydrogen transport that is at a developmental stage.,"Ammonia

Explanation:

Ammonia is a toxic compound for humans.

Whereas ammonia and liquid hydrogen are considered 'one-way carriers' i.e., they get destroyed after extracting the hydrogen, LOHCs are meant to be two-way carriers, meaning that the dehydrogenated liquid will be shipped back to the port of origin for re-hydrogenation.

This means that unlike ammonia, LOHCs do not pose a particularly high threat to human health.

This means that LOHCs are probably more suitable for short distance transport e.g., between the mainland and an island, instead of being an optimal candidate for transoceanic trade.

Both the de-and the hydrogenation of LOHCs processes are not currently done at a large scale in the world and are currently at a developmental stage, meaning that LOHC could come to the market later than the alternative hydrogen carriers Table is not exhaustive.

Reasoning:
The step before obtaining excited states in the RAS-SF + algorithm that involves solving the state-specific Schr√∂dinger equation for equilibrium solvation on excited state k is the step of computing the ground state eigenfunction in the gas phase.

Explanation:
The step before obtaining excited states in the RAS-SF + algorithm that involves solving the state-specific Schr√∂dinger equation for equilibrium solvation on excited state k is the step of computing the ground state eigenfunction in the gas phase.

Reference:
['The algorithm begins by computing the RAS-SF ground state wave function in the gas phase. ', 'Next, one-electron integrals are modified to incorporate R0 and the groundstate total energy is iterated to convergence, as in any SCRF calculation except that the lowest eigenstate of a CI Hamiltonian must be computed at each SCRF iteration. ', 'This completes step 1 in Fig. . ', 'Once the groundstate eigenfunction has been equilibrated with respect to the medium, excited states (including LE and/or CT states, as desired) are obtained by computing additional eigenstates in the presence of a fixed reaction-field operator R0.', 'This approach should be valid in the long-time limit after excitation, whereas the case of a sudden (vertical) excitation requires a nonequilibrium approach, as developed in Section II C. For equilibrium solvation on excited state k, one must solve the statespecific Schr√∂dinger equation( ƒ§vac + Rk )|Œ® k = E k |Œ® k .(5)(Our notation for excited-state PCM calculations follows that used in a recent review.', 'The magnitude of thisD.

248,Wurtzite,"The ground-state structure of a compound that forms a heterostructural alloy Al1-xGdxN with Gd3+ and Al1-xGdxN alloys when x is less than 0.82 is wurtzite.

Reasoning:
The critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82.

Explanation:
We have performed a joint computational and experimental study on the incorporation of Gd3+ into AlN, creating a heterostructural alloy Al1-xGdxN between rocksalt GdN and wurtzite AlN. First-principles calculations using density functional theory in conjunction with SQS supercells reveal that the critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82. We find that increased ionicity of the M-N bond aids in the substitution of larger M cations into wurtzite AlN, in which the structural study (M06-2X/6-31G with a polarizable continuum model for dichloromethane solvent) that shows non-planarity in the calculated ground state minimized structure of SOPS in solution (see Supporting Information, Figures and).

136,The use of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that does not have a conjugation path with 16 œÄ-electrons has been enabled by the ability to modify the properties of the molecule by introducing substituents at the periphery of the molecule or incorporating the molecule into semiconducting polymers.,"The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene serves as an important building block for semiconductors used in organic electronic devices. One of the most important driving forces enabling the use of pyrene over a wide range of applications is the possible functionalization of its molecular backbone. Accordingly, previous research in the field has focused on modifying the properties of pyrene by introducing substituents at the periphery of the molecule or by incorporating pyrene units into semiconducting polymers. However, for neither molecule a conjugation path with 16 œÄ-electrons exists and pyrene as well as azupyrene are aromatic, as is proven by the 1 H-NMR shifts (see Figure ).

524,The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 1.09 eV.,"The optical gap for the lowest energy transition is 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding an even larger difference of 1.09 eV.

Explanation:
In this study, we explore the influence of the 0-topology on the properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by comparing pyrene (Figure , left) with its isomer azupyrene (Figure ,[ 2 . 2 ]22paracyclophane, was obtained from Carbosynth Ltd., bromo-derivative was purchased from BLD Pharmatech (India) Pvt Ltd. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired using The Agilent ProPulse NMR System spectrometer.

Thus, the lower band gap of azupyrene is caused by its nonalternant nature in two ways: (i) the ""frozen orbital"" electronic band gap is smaller, because the HOMO is higher in energy and the LUMO is lower in energy and (ii) the reduced electron-electron repulsion in the excited state leads to an even smaller optical band gap.

552,"Exposure to a gas that interacts with lanthanide-based metal-organic frameworks causes a change in the luminescence intensity because the gas's interaction with the framework triggers either a reversible enhancement or a decrease in the luminescence intensity, depending on the lanthanide ion. This interaction is determined using DFT calculations and electrostatic potential energy maps, which help identify the location of the gas's binding.","The lanthanide-based metal-organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs) are a class of porous materials that have been extensively studied for their potential applications in energy storage, catalysis, and sensing. One of the most promising applications of Ln-MOFs is in photoluminescent sensing, where the luminescence intensity of the Ln-MOF is used to detect the presence of a specific gas.

The sensing mechanism of Ln-MOFs is based on the interaction of the gas with the Ln-MOF, which can cause a change in the luminescence intensity. The gas can interact with the Ln-MOF in different ways, depending on the specific Ln-MOF and the gas. For example, the gas can bind to the Ln-MOF through electrostatic interactions, or it can interact with the Ln-MOF through a chemical reaction.

The change in the luminescence intensity of the Ln-MOF can be used to detect the presence of the gas. The change in the luminescence intensity can be measured using a variety of techniques, such as fluorescence spectroscopy or luminescence imaging.

The change in the luminescence intensity of the Ln-MOF can be caused by a variety of factors, including the concentration of the gas, the temperature, and the pH of the solution. The change in the luminescence intensity can also be affected by the presence of other gases or ions in the solution.

Explanation:
The process of growing a film of a substance with oxygen-rich coordination sites and 8 different configurations of NH2 groups is as follows:

1. A 1 mM solution of copper acetate was first pulled over treated substrates and allowed adhere onto the surface for 10 mins.

2. The substrates were then carefully rinsed by dipping in fresh ethanol before being transferred into another container with a 0.1 mM solution of HHTP ligand in ethanol.

3. The ligand exchange on the substrate surface was then allowed to proceed for 20 minutes without disturbance at ambient.

4. After rinsing off unreacted ligands with fresh ethanol, the dipping steps were repeated to desired film thickness.

5. In addition, the oxygen-rich coordination sites render the Cu-HHTP MOF film predominantly hydrophilic, making it an ideal candidate towards analytes with hydrophilic ends.

6. A total of 8 different configurations of the NH2 groups within the MOF were considered for 1 and 2 in order to account for the fractional occupation of the amino site reported experimentally (Fig. ).

The step after the substrates are carefully rinsed by dipping in fresh ethanol in the process of growing a film of a substance with oxygen-rich coordination sites and 8 different configurations of NH2 groups is to transfer the substrates into another container with a 0.1 mM solution of HHTP ligand in ethanol.

325,The inward bend is approximately 0.2 degrees.,"The degree of the inward bend of the monomer of a linear molecule that forms complexes with He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Hg in the r SE e structure is 0.2 ‚Ä¢.

Explanation:
The OCS monomer in the r SE e structure is only slightly distorted from the equilibrium values, with a 0.2 ‚Ä¢ inward bend.

The O=C‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Xe angle is also essentially the same when a linear OCS is assumed in the r (2) m structure.

The experiments are supported by a wide array of highly accurate calculations, expanding the analysis to the complexes of He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Hg with OCS.

Explanation:

The components of the final degradation products were determined by ESI-MS.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging: S. aureus, E. coli and V. anguillarum cultured to the exponential period were diluted with MH medium to a concentration of 2√ó10^7 CFU/mL. Then the bacteria suspension was mixed with an equal volume of K18S4 solution, and the final polymer concentration was 5√óMIC.

Moreover, cross-resistance was observed on the norfloxacin-treated 264th generation S. aureus against gentamycin and thiamphenicol, and on the ampicillin-treated 504th generation E. coli against penicillin and kanamycin (Fig 3e), which reflects the serious problem of cross-resistance among antibiotics used in aquaculture.

Comment:",BCA cannot describe collective many-body effects and its Frenkelpair based description becomes inappropriate for amorphous disordered regions. Classical MD is less accurate for far-from-equilibrium geometries during collision cascades and does not fully account for changes in the electronic structure.,0.4415584415584416,0.0,0.2721518987341772,0.22852451173986216,0.46181419894453846,0.6070610228276739,0.07780320366132724,0.0,0.021910604732690624,0.020359308923460488,0.23455663472611527,0.5071001978224623
83,"Using CASPT2 instead of CASSCF in parametrizing a linear vibronic coupling approach leads to a larger retention and relative retention of the singlet population because it partially quenches the 3 A 2 internal conversion and the Sing -- 3 T 2 back-intersystem crossing, which would otherwise lead to the population's movement via the 3 T 1 ≤ -- 3 A 2 pathway and the Sing -- 3 T 2 back-intersystem crossing, respectively.","The CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics show a larger retention of singlet population at extended simulation times, i.e., 9% in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics vs. 1% in the CASSCF dynamics.

The CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics also show a larger relative retention, as the singlet population falls from the maximum of 43% to 9%, i.e,. to ca. a fifth of its maximum value, while it falls from 10% to 1%, i.e., a tenth of its maximum value in the CASSCF dynamics.

Using a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) approach, where only first-order terms are included, the model can be parametrized from a single-point calculation including gradients, non-adiabatic couplings and spin-orbit couplings.

While the usage of harmonic normal modes and the truncation to first-order constrain the LVC model to predict meaningful potential energy surfaces only in vicinity of its reference geometry, the rigid structure of many transition-metal complexes confines their motion in photophysical processes close to its starting area, making LVC model a useful approximation in the study of excited-state dynamics of transition-metal complexes.

Comment: I'm not sure I understand the question.

Reason:

The topology of azupyrene also leads to a more localized charge distribution, visible in the experimental XPS and NMR shifts as well as in the DFT-calculated partial charges, all showing a negative charge surplus at the apices of the 7-membered rings and positive charge at the central C2-unit.

Those differences in electronic structure are reflected in the absorption and fluorescence behavior, a lower electron-hole binding energy, and a lower barrier to electron-hole separation for azupyrene.
