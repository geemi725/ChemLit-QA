High Throughput Determination of Stern Volmer Quenching Constants for Common Photocatalysts and Quenchers Mechanistic information on reactions proceeding via photoredox catalysis has enabled rational optimizations of existing reactions and revealed new synthetic pathways. One essential step in any photoredox reaction is catalyst quenching via photoinduced electron transfer or energy transfer with either a substrate, additive, or co-catalyst. Identification of the correct quencher using Stern-Volmer studies is a necessary step mechanistic understanding; however, such studies are often cumbersome, low throughput and require specialized luminescence instruments. This report describes a high throughput method to rapidly acquire series of Stern-Volmer constants, employing readily available fluorescence plate readers and 96 well-plates. By leveraging multi-channel pipettors or liquid dispensing robots in combination with fast plate readers, the sampling frequency for quenching studies can be improved by several orders of magnitude. This new high-throughput method enabled the rapid collection of 220 quenching constants for a library of 20 common photocatalysts with 11 common quenchers. The extensive Stern-Volmer constants table generated greatly facilitates the systematic comparison between quenchers and can provide guidance to the synthetic community interested in designing and understanding catalytic photoredox reactions.

This workA) B) No significant amount of side-products was observed by HPLC analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of reaction has never been described before and represents a new type of crossover system. The literature describes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis/alcoholysis of sulfinamides, and recently, two groups have reported transulfinamidation of primary sulfinamides with an excess of (hydroxyl)amines under metal catalysis. These are the closest examples of similar sulfinamide reactivity. Encouraged by the initial results, we set off to determine the scope of this reaction. First, the N-substituents were varied. Various tertiary sulfinamides with cyclic and acyclic aliphatic N-substituents underwent the crossover reaction with high yields, resulting in an almost equimolar mixture of products as determined by HPLC (Fig. ). Sulfinamides 1f and 2fbearing basic tertiary amino group can also serve as substrates for the crossover when 0.4 equivs of TFA catalyst is utilized. Secondary sulfinamides are also suitable substrates, as exemplified by Fig. entry 6. Interestingly, secondary sulfinamides 1h and 2h with an electron-poor aromatic N-substituent also provided the crossover products. Next, the combination of substrates 1a and 3b with S-aromatic and S-aliphatic substituents was tested.Despite the slower reaction rate (24 h reaction), a significant amount of the crossover products was also observed (entry 8). All crossover reactions of two substrates were performed in both directions, starting with a different set of substrates. A comparison of these experiments indicates that regardless of the starting substrates, the reactions lead to

regulation is crucial for cellular responses in intracellular signaling pathways . A few methods have achieved quantitative protein translocation using caged CID systems or optogenetics . In these cases, the illumination dose was adjusted to control protein translocation levels. However, fine-tuning based on the illumination dose remains challenging, especially for caged CID systems. Because of the irreversible photolysis reaction, once the protein is translocated excessively than expected, it is difficult to reduce the translocation level. The photochromic CID system implemented quantitative and repetitive recruitment of the target protein. Because the photochromic CID system is based on fast and reversible photoisomerization of the ligand, protein recruitment is quantitatively regulated by the fraction of the active Z isomer. In this study, we demonstrated quantitative control by the illumination wavelength (Fig. ) and intensity ratio of dual-wavelength illumination (Fig. ). These single-and dual-wavelengthbased regulation methods enabled the control of subcellular protein translocation with prompt response, sufficient duration, quantitativeness, and reversibility. The photochromic CID system allowed the photoreversible recruitment of PINK1 on the MOM, unlike the traditional FKBP-FRB-based CID technique . This advantage enabled investigation of the relationship between the anchoring time of PINK1 and Parkin accumulation on the MOM. We found that Parkin accumulation was accelerated only when cytPINK1 was anchored to the MOM (Fig. ). It has been reported that the phosphorylation of Parkin enhances the affinity of

The impinging single sheets and resulting mixed sheet were illuminated by a 365 nm UV light panel with dimensions of 8 cm x 12 cm. Since the UV source power was not constant over the entire mixed sheet, equation 21 was not used for calculating the fluorescence at any point in the mixed sheet. Only general predictions from the equation such as a proportionality between 𝐹𝐼 and the path length (at a specific point in the mixed sheet) were used for analysis of the results.Instead, the relative nature of fluorescence indicated that the fluorescence intensity of a mixed sheet produced from the impingement of acid and base could be compared to the fluorescence intensity of the impingement of buffers or constant pH reference solutions. The relationship between fluorescence intensity and hydroxide ion (or hydrogen ion) concentration was determined by self-impinging identical reference solutions of known pH (i.e impinging single sheets of the same solution at one another). Unlike the acid-base impingement, there were no concentration profiles in the mixed sheet for the impinged reference solutions, and thus, the measured fluorescence intensity at any point in the mixed sheet applied to the pH of the reference solution. For each experimental run, buffer solutions of pH 4 or 6, 7, 8, and 10 were typically self-impinged along with self-impingement of the acid reactant (pH < 3) and selfimpingement of the base reactant (pH > 11).

We first demonstrated that the association of reagent I with bromide anion and styrene derivatives allows the formation vinyl-SCF3 compounds in moderated to excellent yields. Then, we reported that the association of this reaction with a HAT catalyst provides the formation of benzoyl-SCF3 compounds when using aldehydes as starting materials. EPR spectroscopy experiments allowed the detection of key radical intermediates and delivered precious preliminary information regarding the reaction mechanism. Further investigations using reagent I are currently conducted in our laboratory and will be reported in due course. Experimental SectionSynthesis of vinyl-SCF3 3: To a 10 mL tube were sequentially added ethene-1,1-diyldibenzenes (0.2 mmol, 1 equiv.), reagent (0.24 1.2 equiv.), (0.01 mmol, 5 mol%), sodium bromide (0.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), and acetonitrile (1 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred under 40w blue LED irradiation for 24 h allowing temperature to rise to 50 °C due to the proximity to the light. After completion, the reaction was quenched with a saturated brine solution, then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was then purified by column chromatography on silica gel.

At the small angles of incidence αi, typically 0.025°, the vertical size, 3 µm, of the focused beam results in a footprint length of typically ca. 7 mm along the surface, probing a statistically relevant electrode area, all within the active surface. For values of αi below a critical angle αc, the penetration depth of the evanescent X-rays in the film is low and the scattering signal originates only from the topmost layer of the photoactive material (Figure ). For αi > αc the X-ray penetration depth in the sample quickly increases, as indicated by the occurrence of diffraction peaks from the FTO substrate. Measuring at αi < αc is therefore essential to determine structural information limited to the surface of the electrode as shown in Figure . Here we detect the intensity changes of the CuBi2O4 and FTO reflections as a function of αi. The critical angle of αc =0.032° is experimentally determined as the angle at which the intensity of the CuBi2O4 (211) reflection is maximized while no signal from the FTO structure is detected. Moreover, at a given incidence angle we utilize two large-area detectors positioned at different sample-to-detector (SDD) distances for the acquisition of TS and GISAXS signal at the same time as shown in Figure . Once the incidence angle is fixed, GISAXS intensities can be extracted from the second detector (Figure ).Here we report intensity as a function of the scattering vector in the plane of the substrate (𝑞 !"" ) and plot it in Figure .

Analysis of the Valence Electronic StructureAzupyrene with its nonalternant -electron system has a much smaller optical gap than its alternant isomer pyrene. This is apparent in the intense yellow color displayed by solutions of azupyrene, whereas solutions of pyrene are colorless (See insets in Figure ). In agreement with the yellow color of azupyrene, the UV/Vis spectrum (Figure ) shows an absorption peak for azupyrene at a photon energy of 2.6 eV, in the blue part of the visible range. Pyrene has its lowest energy peak at a much higher photon energy of 3.7 eV, well outside the visible range. The resulting optical excitation energies, determined from the rising edge of the peak, are 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding a difference of 1.09 eV. Our ab initio calculations within the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) approach (see vertical lines in Figure ) overestimate the absolute excitation energies for both molecules. However, the calculations yield a difference in transition energies of 1.10 eV between azupyrene and pyrene, in excellent agreement with the experiment. It should be noted that while the lowest energy excitation corresponds to the transition from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO→LUMO) in pyrene, this transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and the peak in the visible range has to be attributed to the transition into a higher lying unoccupied orbital (HOMO→LUMO+1). The calculated data for the UPS and NEXAFS spectra was rigidly shifted to match the experimental energy scale. The calculated NEXAFS transitions have already been published in context of method development. The optical gap determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy must be distinguished from

The variant R229W shows a slightly larger hydrophobic SASA component (+1 nm 2 ) and lower hydrophilic SASA (-0.4 nm 2 ) when compared with the wild-type enzyme (Table ), but no major conformational changes were detected in the two mutated systems (Figures and). Thus, our computational data confirm that the mutation R229W does not change the hydrophilic patterning of the surface or the total conformation of the protein, but rather modifies the network of interactions of the active site with its first sphere environment (F377).On the one hand, we have found that the Zn 2+ -dependent hLAMAN follows an E5  4 H5/ 1 S5  1 S5 conformational itinerary, similar to the one observed in the Ca 2+ -dependent GH92 α-mannosidase. On the other hand, overall, in this work we have used different computational approaches to understand at the atomic level the impact that several mutations have on the biological role of hLAMAN. We have shed light on the molecular basis of the pathophysiology of 4 missense mutations in LAMAN. D74E shows a larger energy barrier, D159N and E402K may affect the conformation at the active site, and R229Wdoes not impact the SASA distribution in hLAMAN and its effect should be connected with the chemical dynamics of the active site.

that facilitates the derivation of small organic molecule force field parameters, and also allows the user to derive the positions of off-site charges to model anisotropic electron density and to fit dihedral parameters to QM torsion scans. QUBE force fields have been derived for 109 small organic molecules, and yield mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm 3 , 0.79 kcal/mol and 1.17 kcal/mol in computed liquid density, heat of vaporization and free energy of hydration. These results are competitive with standard transferable force fields, which have been extensively fit to properties such as these.To achieve our goal of employing the QUBE force field in computer-aided drug design applications, we require a compatible protein force field. Since the non-bonded parametrization strategy employed in QUBE is very different to that used in the standard biomolecular force fields (e.g. AMBER, OPLS, CHARMM), there is no reason to believe that they are compatible. However, by implementing the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameter derivation methods in the ONETEP linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) software, we have shown that it is feasible to derive these charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for entire proteins. In this way, the number of fitting parameters is substantially reduced, and we have a consistent parametrization approach that can be applied to both small and large molecules, including entire biomolecular assemblies. Since, in this approach, all non-bonded parameters are derived from a single QM calculation, both the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters naturally include the native state polarization effects of the environment. Importantly, we have shown that protein charges derived using DDEC electron density partitioning recreate the underlying QM electrostatic potential with high accuracy,

revealed surprisingly that the enzyme compensates for the stability gaps between the intermediate complex and product duplex primarily by raising the stability of the nicked duplex, thereby helping to overcome product inhibition. In support of this observation, Lohman and coworkers' recently revealed that T4 DNA ligase bound more strongly to a nicked duplex over a duplex (Knet,nick = 2.5 -3.3 x 10 8 M -1 and Knet,duplex = 2.8 -7.25 x 10 6 M -1 , respectively). This difference in magnitude of 10 2 in the enzyme binding affinity can help explain how the KA, prod/KA, inter ratio in the absence of the enzyme shrank from 10 3 -10 4 to 10 2 in the presence of the enzyme. The KA from the kinetic model contains contributions from both the intrinsic binding affinity of the DNA and the binding affinity of the enzyme for the complexes, so both of these effective Kprod and Kinter values are expected to increase in the presence of the enzyme. The change in Kinter is consistent with a higher binding constant for the intermediate complex in the presence of enzyme. Although the effective Kprod (with enzyme) is slightly lower than the K of the product duplex from ITC, we believe that this <4-fold difference is not significant, and that the stability of the product duplex is essentially unaffected by the presence or absence of ligase. ).

ground-state energies. Many applications (e.g., spectroscopy, photochemistry), require going beyond ground-state calculations and computing excited states. The development of quantum algorithms for molecular excited states is more challenging compared to the ground-state algorithms. The existing quantum algorithms for excited states often require a large number of qubits and gate operations, which precludes their application to larger systems. This is because the excited states often have more complex wavefunctions (open-shell, multi-configurational) even when the corresponding ground states are well behaved. Furthermore, in contrast to the ground state (which is unique in the sense that it is the lowest-energy state), there are many excited states, so the quantum algorithms should be capable of targeting a specific state (or states)e.g., the lowest energy states or states in a particular energy range, states of a particular symmetry/spin, states of a particular character, etc.The success of the VQE algorithm for ground-state calculations has inspired extensions to excited states, leading to variational quantum deflation (VQD) , subspace-search VQE (SSVQE) , and other algorithms . The underlying framework of all VQE-based methods is variational principle. The VQE-based methods for excited states employ supplementary constraints, so that the resulting algorithms look for a minimum-energy state orthogonal to the previously computed states. For example, the central element of VQD is the penalty terms in the cost function (which is subject to minimization). The penalty terms quantify the overlap between the previously obtained solutions and the current target state. The minimization

IntroductionPhotochemical and photophysical reactions in transition-metal complexes occur when the compound is excited to higher-lying electronic states via light absorption. The complex can then experience a cascade of processes involving different electronic states connected through the motion of the molecules' nuclei. The participation of different electronic states introduces new flexibility to the system by opening up reaction pathways beyond the ones that are accessible in thermal ground-state chemistry. This flexibility then lays the foundation to the many application found in photochemistry , covering areas as diverse as catalysis, memory storage, energy storage, display and lighting technology, or medicine. While a blessing for applications, the flexibility is a challenge for the rational design of photoactive materials, as it needs to control not only the properties of the different electronic states but also the motion connecting them.

the plasma membrane and further rearrangement of the local lipid distribution at their binding site allows high concentration of fatty acids that covalently modify pMLKL. Acylation of pMLKL oligomers would allow the local recruitment of VLCFAs to membrane regions that already possess different mechanical and structural properties, which facilitates their membrane disruption action.Second, we define the scope of protein VLCFAcylation during necroptosis using state-ofthe-art quantitative proteomics methods. Overall, we observe a decreased number of proteins are modified by a representative VLCFA during necroptosis. Pathway analysis conducted using proteins that show different levels of VLCFAcylation during necroptosis highlighted the enrichment of proteins belonging to the endocytic and lysosomal pathways. Previous studies have shown that pMLKL can associate with ESCRT proteins and flotillins which is suggested to result in the removal of pMLKL containing regions from the plasma membrane and their degradation. In parallel, flotillin association of pMLKL can result in its removal from the plasma membrane via exosomes. Based on these observations, it is clear that vesicular trafficking is key for maintenance of pMLKL and MLKL at the plasma membrane. We show that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulted in a strong rescue from cell death during necroptosis and decreased the levels of membrane bound pMLKL, whereas the whole cellular MLKL levels remained unchanged, suggesting that the inhibition of endocytosis pathway enhances the removal of pMLKL from the plasma membrane and preserves plasma membrane integrity. These results suggest for the first time that targeting endocytosis could be a way to delay membrane permeability during necroptosis.

Grey hydrogenGrey hydrogen is produced by dehydrogenation of fossil fuels. There are two main grey hydrogen production processes:1. Reforming: hydrogen is produced by reacting a fossil fuel with steam, thereby releasing hydrogen as well as carbon monoxide, a mixture commonly referred to as 'syngas':CmHn + mH2O -> mCO + (m+n/2)H2(1)2. Partial oxidation: in this process, a fossil fuel is combusted with a sub-stoichiometric amount of oxygen, leading to the production of syngas:CmHn + m/2O2 -> mCO + n/2H2 (2)Steam methane reforming (SMR) is the leading process to produce grey hydrogen. In 2021, the global hydrogen demand reached a peak of 94 Mt. Currently, about 48% of the hydrogen produced worldwide (~45 Mt in 2021) comes from SMR. This process consists of dehydrogenating methane (commonly from a natural gas stream) to produce a hydrogen-rich mixture, and it is the cheapest at the industrial scale. However, its environmental impact is very high: every kg of H2 produced in this way generates around 8 kg of CO2, indirectly. Oil and coal gasification are still heavily used, accounting for the 30% (~28 Mt) and 18% (~17 Mt) of the world's hydrogen production in 2021, respectively. Typically, grey hydrogen production processes include additional steps (e.g., water-gas shift and acid gas removal) to maximize the hydrogen yield and separate the carbon oxides from the hydrogen stream.Among the traditional methods of producing grey hydrogen (reforming and partial oxidation), autothermal reforming (ATR) is used in less proportion.

The device resistance showed to decrease significantly upon immersion, even when as little as 10 fM of the fluorinated acid was present. With careful dilution of the analyte solution, we found a detection limit of our MOF-based sensor to be as low as 5 fM (or 0.002 ng/L of PFOA) as shown in Figure &. Such sensitivity could be attributed to the high surface area of our MOF films, as well as the chemical affinity of the metal active sites towards the fluorinated acid. Furthermore, we tested 10 different devices and showed a linear correlation (R 2 > 0.968) between the conductance and the logarithm of PFAS concentration (Fig. ) indicative of the reliability of the MOF film approach. A similar behavior was also observed when the MOF-based sensor was used to detect PFOS, another common PFA (Fig. ). As previously mentioned, the PFA sensing is based on the adsorption of the PFAS molecules onto the MOFs sites which further allowed our sensors to be used at least 10 times without declining performance (Fig. ). Here we tested the reusability of the sensing device at low (10 nM) PFAS concentration and showed that the device exhibits reversible resistance change even after 10 cycles, likely due to abundant binding sites at the film interface.

difference spectra (EADS) -the latter resulting from a global fit of the data using a sequential kinetic scheme.At first, observation of the datasets collected at three different excitation wavelengths suggests that the main features of the observed dynamics are similar for all three excitation wavelengths.However, significant differences are present in the details of decay kinetics and the intensity ratios of different bands. Let us first classify the different spectral regions by assigning them with names to aid the discussion of the dynamics in detail. Starting from the high energy side (Figure ), the difference spectra consist of an induced absorption (IA) band peaking around 330 nm (hereafter referred to as IA-330), and a ground state bleach (GSB) corresponding to the strong 355 nm absorption seen in the steady-state spectrum (denoted GSB-355). Further to the red, IA is again observed as a broad band stretching up to ca. 450 nm (IA-400), from where it is again replaced by a GSB signal exhibiting a clear vibronic-like structure -similar to the series of maxima observed in the red part of the absorption spectrum (GSB-550). A detailed summary of the fs-ns transient absorption dynamics is presented in the form of EADS in Figure , E and F. The presented spectra are a result of fitting the data to a sequential kinetic model (A  B  C …). The error on the time constants in the ps range is of the order of 25%, and the last constant in the ns range cannot be estimated precisely due to the limited experimental time window. The spectrum of an initial component (lifetime of ca. 150 fs) was strongly contaminated by coherent-coupling artifacts, and was therefore omitted from the presentation. The quality of the fit can be assessed from the traces depicted in Figure , and the similar data for other excitation

Protein DynamicsFigure : A comparison of the QUBE and OPLS non-bonded parameters for ubiquitin. The regions circled in correspond to carbonyl carbon atoms, which are expected to be electron deficient and therefore require small A and B Lennard-Jones coefficients. Blue and dashed black lines represent lines of best fit and y = x respectively. The use of system-specific non-bonded parameters for biomolecular force fields allows for long-ranged polarization effects to be included, which is expected to improve the accuracy of the force field, particularly for measurements such as protein-ligand binding affinity that are sensitive to the electrostatic potential at the protein surface. A comparison of the QUBE and OPLS non-bonded parameters for ubiquitin is shown in Figure . Figures for the other proteins tested follow similar trends. As we have described, QUBE non-bonded parameters are derived directly from the QM partitioned electron density, and so, each atom has a unique charge and set of Lennard-Jones coefficients which depend on its environment. In contrast, the OPLS parameters are read from a library of atom types. The QUBE and OPLS charges correlate well with no clear outliers. As has previously been observed, the QUBE Lennard-Jones parameters show a far greater level of variation than OPLS (and most other force fields).One assumption employed in the use of system-specific charges for proteins (and small molecules) is that the derived parameter set is not too dependent on the molecular conformation. To investigate this assumption, the sensitivity of the non-bonded parameters, for the GB3 protein, to the choice of input structure is investigated in Section S6.2. Ten structures were extracted from a MD simulation employing the OPLS-AA/M force field, and QUBE

"Context:
Discussion and ConclusionThe assumption that biomolecular force fields must be parametrized against the experimental properties of small molecules has persisted since MM simulations began and remains in all force fields under widespread use. In this work, we look to challenge this assumption by deriving system-specific non-bonded parameters, from linear-scaling QM simulations, for consistency with the QUBE small molecule force field. These non-bonded terms were used here alongside libraries of (non-bespoke) bond and angle parameters, derived using the modified Seminario method, and newly reparametrized torsional terms.We have shown here that using system-specific non-bonded force field parameters can result in accurate conformational preferences for short peptides. Rotamer populations and simulated J couplings for the dipeptide molecules are in good agreement with experimental data and compare favorably with the latest OPLS force field. For longer peptide molecules, the problems associated with fitting torsional parameters to a system-specific force field became more apparent. Using regularization in the fitting process was shown to overcome these issues and resulted in a J coupling error of just 0.90 ± 0.03 for the alanine pentapeptide. Further work investigating disordered peptides will ascertain how general this fix is.The accuracy of the peptide simulations supports the use of our non-bonded and modified Seminario bonded parametrization strategies. In protein MD simulations, the RMSD of the backbone atoms relative to experimental structures remained low, below 2 Å, for two of the five proteins tested. The α-helices present in all of the proteins generally remained close to the experimental structures, but the β-sheets exhibited

A Automatic Generation of Internal CoordinatesOur approach for finding internal coordinates, illustrated in figure , begins by constructing a molecular graph from the initial Cartesian geometry. This is accomplished by checking all pairs of atoms, and adding a bond ifx j -x i < σ r cov i + r cov j ,(35)where x i and x j are the Cartesian position of atoms i and j, σ is a scalar parameter which in Sella defaults to 1.25, and r cov i and r cov j are the covalent radii of atoms i and j. After all pairs of atoms have been checked, a flood fill algorithm is used to count the number of disconnected fragments in the molecular graph. This algorithm works by walking along the graph and noting which atoms belong to the same fragment, then counting the number of distinct fragments. If only a single fragment is found, the algorithm exits; otherwise, σ is increased by 5 % and the above procedure is repeated with the additional rule that only pairs of atoms in different molecular fragments are checked for connectivity. This additional rule helps ensure that geometries with large separation between clusters of atoms do not become densely connected. This procedure For systems composed of independent molecules, it may not be chemically meaningful to consider internal coordinates that connect two molecules together. However, the previously described procedure will necessarily add bonds, angles, and dihedrals that span across molecules. This can have a negative impact on performance, as the optimizer will limit the extent to which these chemically irrelevant coordinates can change at each step. To resolve this problem, we also implement as an alternative the translational and rotation internal coordinates (TRIC) method of Wang and Song. When

This could be done in a manner similar to peptide synthesis but using entire proteins as building blocks. The controlled production of multi-protein polymers could be an enabling technology for protein based materials, biomedical technologies, and enzyme engineering. Although the megaTYR mutants to date were not fully prevented from acting on cationic substrates, the range in selectivity between abTYR and D55R megaTYR proved a tantalizing target. To test this, the cysteine-containing Y200C sfGFP was modified with EEEEY and RRRRY C-terminal tags, which should be unreactive with abTYR, and D55R megaTYR, respectively (Figure , S4). After purification, the Y200C sfGFP-EEEEY (GFP-E4Y) was exposed to abTYR for 30 min in a variety of conditions. Notably, the mushroom tyrosinase was able to append GGGGY and RRRRY peptides to the GFP-E4Y without oxidizing the EEEEY tag. In addition, exposing the GFP-E4Y to abTYR resulted in no discernable oxidation by ESI-MS. This aligns with our previous peptide screens, and suggests that the EEEEY tag is not succeptible to abTYR activation (Figure ). Similarly, Y200C sfGFP-RRRRY (GFP-R4Y) was exposed to D55R megaTYR under similar conditions, with the EEEEY peptide used in place of the RRRRY peptide. Similarly to abTYR, D55R megaTYR was able to selectively oxidize the added peptides without modifying the tyrosine tag on the GFP-R4Y. Reaction selectivity was further confirmed when exposure of GFP-R4Y to D55R megaTYR alone did not result in any oxidation (Figure ). Together these data suggest that abTYR and D55R megaTYR can be used for CDSAT on proteins and peptides.To further validate reaction orthogonality we

to assess the cationic species present in H-FAU zeolite with Si/Al ratio ~15. Thermal treatment at temperatures below 600 ⁰C followed by CO adsorption at room temperature develops a band at ~2237 cm -1 and exhibits a maximum at 2232 cm -1 when saturated (yellow trace, Fig. ). We recently demonstrated that the extra-framework aluminum (EFAL) species that form in zeolite after thermal/steaming treatment are alumina clusters formed during steaming with a high proportion of coordinatively unsaturated penta Al sites (due to their small size) : CO adsorption on these sites produces the presently observed band with a maximum at 2240-2232 cm - 1 . These sites form upon elution of mobile hydrated Al species from the framework and subsequent coalescence of the mobile species into alumina clusters/nanoparticles .Heating the H-FAU sample under vacuum to 650 ⁰C, followed by cooling and CO adsorption at room temperature (Fig. ), led to CO adsorbed on Al sites of alumina clusters as well as the immediate formation of a new signal ascribed to a Lewis acid site that coordinates CO with the C-O stretching frequency of 2252 cm -1 . Such a Lewis acid site has not been reported for any zeolite; this C-O stretching frequency of 2252 cm -1 is the highest known for any supported material. The high C-O stretching frequency suggests that this Lewis site is super-electrophilic and its ability to coordinate CO suggests that it is coordinatively unsaturated. We explored the properties of this site by pulling high vacuum (~10 -8 Torr) at room temperature, which leads to the disappearance of the CO band on alumina clusters but the 2252 cm -1 band is retained, signifying its stability (Fig. ).

The transition are characterized by the presence of an imaginary frequencies i288 cm -1 and i273 cm -1 for TS1proR,C and TS1proS,C respectively. Furthermore, in the TS1proR,C transition state a hydrophobic interaction from M105 was observed with 3, while no such interaction of 3 was observed in TS1proS,C. The system then relaxed to the low energy state intermediates Int1proR,C and Int1proS,C, which are characterized in the local minima state by the presence of all real frequency values indicating stable structures. The Int1proR,C has lower energy (6.7 kcal mol -1 ) than the Int1proS,C configuration (9.8 kcal mol -1 ), which favours the proR configuration pathway over the proS pathway.

IntroductionPhotochemical and photophysical reactions in transition-metal complexes occur when the compound is excited to higher-lying electronic states via light absorption. The complex can then experience a cascade of processes involving different electronic states connected through the motion of the molecules' nuclei. The participation of different electronic states introduces new flexibility to the system by opening up reaction pathways beyond the ones that are accessible in thermal ground-state chemistry. This flexibility then lays the foundation to the many application found in photochemistry , covering areas as diverse as catalysis, memory storage, energy storage, display and lighting technology, or medicine. While a blessing for applications, the flexibility is a challenge for the rational design of photoactive materials, as it needs to control not only the properties of the different electronic states but also the motion connecting them.

This absorption data demonstrates that the selection of a particular silyloxy cap can be used to control the structure of the porphyrin ring.The examined porphyrins were fluorescent in a dichloromethane solution (Table and Figure ). For 2 we observed a very strong emission band at 650 nm and a much smaller emission at 711 nm. This two-emission profile is typical of porphyrins, and is attributed to two tautomeric states. In toluene, 2 has the same λmax as in dichloromethane but emits relatively more intensely at 711 nm.

Compound 3 permits the determination of the T1 level because the lowest energy level of Gd 3+ (32200 cm -1 ) is well above the S1 and T1 levels of NH2-BDC (as confirmed below) and therefore only phosphorescence of the ligand can be observed.The singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) energy levels of the ligand were determined as the onsets of the fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at about 405 nm (24700 cm -1 ) and 479 nm (20900 cm -1 ), respectively (see Figure and explanation within). The energy position of T1 with respect to the 5 DJ states of Ln 3+ is one of the most relevant factors to determine the lanthanide luminescence efficiency in coordination compounds is the energy of T1 with respect to the 5 DJ states of Ln 3+ . Previous studies have shown that for efficient room temperature Ln luminescence, the energy gap between the lowest T1 energy level and the emitting state of the lanthanide ion ΔE ( 3 ππ*-5 D0) should be larger than 2500 cm -1 . , To ensure a fast and irreversible energy transfer.

The calculated mixing free energy indicates that at equilibrium conditions and at temperatures below 1000 K, there is a large miscibility gap and only a few percent of Gd can be incorporated in AlN. Higher (effective) temperatures that can be accessed with non-equilibrium growth methods will enable higher Gd incorporation. By exploiting these non-equilibrium growth conditions experimentally via combinatorial RF co-sputtering, we have achieved significantly higher Gd concentrations in the wurtzite phase (x ≈ 0.25) than in previous thin film syntheses and therefore significantly expanded the range of alloys in this new materials system. Future growth optimization may be able to further increase the range of Gd that can be incorporated into AlN. Expanding our computational analysis to Pr 3+ and Tb 3+ , which show similar behavior to Gd 3+ , and comparing ionic size effects with electronegativity for all the cations that have been considered for substitution into AlN allows us to develop design rules for Al 1-x M x N alloys. We find that increased ionicity of the M -N bond aids in the substitution of larger M cations into wurtzite AlN, in which the

 Alternatively, metabolic labeling of native phospholipids has also been leveraged for expansion of membranes using click-ExM, which anchors lipids to the hydrogel network through a biotin-streptavidin conjugation. Notably, these methods require at least mild permeabilization of the membrane, which can compromise its integrity and potentially alter its structure, to ensure a uniform distribution of ExM reagents and isotropic expansion of samples.We were motivated by a desire to visualize lipids using ExM with molecular detail while preserving the structural integrity of the membranes. Here, we present an approach involving metabolic labeling of natural phospholipids, a trifunctional fluorophore for the tagging and tethering of lipids to the hydrogel, and membrane-permeable expansion reagents (Figure ). This method, termed Lipid Expansion Microscopy (LExM), allows for the tunable and isotropic expansion of membranes through direct anchoring of phospholipids into the polymer network without permeabilization. We demonstrate that LExM is a general method for the expansion of metabolically labeled lipids to enable super-resolution imaging of organelle membranes, and we apply LExM to visualize sub-diffraction scale invaginations of the nuclear membrane and their membrane-bound cytoplasmic contents. To incorporate phospholipids directly into the hydrogel network, we designed and prepared trifunctional LExM reagent 1 (Figure ), which is equipped with (i) an azido group for tagging alkyne-labeled biomolecules via Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), (ii) a BODIPY fluorophore for imaging pre-and post-LExM, and (iii) a methacrylamide polymerizable unit for direct

Non-adiabatic dynamicsWe initiate the dynamics on the excited electronic state with an initial vibrational state slightly shifted to the right of the equilibrium posint. The surprisal is propagated on a basis of 20 vibrational functions per electronic state and in addition we compute two approximations where the surprisal is expanded using only a dominant set of constraints. The approximate computations use a minimal and a slightly larger basis of operators as identified in table . We captures such subtle features as the oscillation of the electronic coherence due to the slow vibrational motion, period of 35 fs, Fig. ). The out of phase motion of the population of the excited state and the coherence is to be expected because the maximal coherence is when the population of the excited state is maximally depleted.

For the measurements, the relative pressure range went from 1.82×10 -5 to 0.998. Equilibration intervals of 10 s were employed. Isotherms were recorded twice in independent experiments. Before measurements, the materials were degassed at a temperature of 110 °C under vacuum for 12 h. The vacuum pressure reached after the latter procedure was ca. 0.05 mbar. Surface area calculations were performed using the methods based on the χ and BET theories . The latter was applied for comparison purposes and considering the consistency criteria proposed by Rouquerol et al. , according to our previous work (see Table ). The methods and advantages of using the χ-theory based method were discussed in a previous contribution .

A four-step phase-cycle procedure was used to eliminate unwanted echo contributions. Fourier transformation of the data in both directions yielded 2D (u 1 ,u 2 ) spectra (Figs. 3a,c and S25-26) in which the nuclear cross-peaks (i.e. peaks that correlate nuclear frequencies from opposite spin-manifolds) of the 1 H and C nuclei appeared in the (+,+) quadrant of the (u 1 ,u 2 ) map, at separations equivalent with the corresponding hyperfine coupling frequencies (weak coupling regime: 2Iu n I>IAI). The contour lineshape of the cross peaks, and their displacement from the anti-diagonal about the nuclear Larmor frequency (u n ), relate to the magnitude and anisotropy of the hyperfine couplings, and thus analysis of the HYSCORE spectra allows to determine such parameters.

ConclusionIn summary, we have successfully obtained a carbazole-based sp 2 carbon COF nanosheet, JUC-557nanosheet, with a thickness about 2.5 nm by exfoliating the corresponding pristine bulk powder. Owing to the synergistic effect of the AIE-molecular rotors (PE) and ACQ-based chromophore units (carbazole), JUC-557-nanosheet demonstrates high absolute quantum yields (up to 23.0%) in both solid-state and solution. Also, electron-rich carbazole and electron-deficient cyan are uniformly distributed and exposed on the channel wall, rendering efficient combining with the analytes for detection. Therefore, JUC-557nanosheet as a sensitive fluorescence sensor exhibits an excellent molecular recognition toward the essential element in the human body (Fe 3+ with K a of 1.98  10 4 M -1 and LOD of 706 ppb), radioactive contaminant (I 2 with K a of 2.10  10 5 M -1 and LOD of 302 ppb), explosive (TNT with K a of 4.38  10 5 M -1 and LOD of 129 ppb), and especially toxic nitro-compounds (such as NB with K a of 6.18  10 6 M -1 and LOD of 5 ppb), which is far superior to previous fluorescence detection materials, including COFs, MOFs, POPs, small molecule probes, and inorganics. Due to its high chemical stability, JUC-557nanosheet exhibits a good luminescence and sensitive molecule recognition even under extreme conditions, such as in strong acid with pH = 1 or strong base with pH = 14. Moreover, JUC-557-nanosheet can be assembled into visual detection equipment, allowing easy optical trace detection of various analytes. Finally, the molecular recognition mechanism was investigated by a combined theoretical and experimental studies, including TRPL measurements, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. Our study thus promotes the development of stable fluorescence COF nanosheets as novel versatile sensing platforms that could be integrated with electronic devices for environment monitoring.

Further, the effect of pressure on k1 is significant at low temperatures, but vanishes at temperatures above 600 K.The aforementioned unique temperature-and pressure-dependent behaviors are related to the properties of R1 potential energy surface (PES), which governs the reaction mechanism, kinetics, and dynamics. Indeed, there exists a relatively stable intermediate between the two HO2 radicals, namely the H2O4 intermediate (the HO2 radical dimer) on the triplet state surface, whose energetics and spectroscopic characterization have also been scrutinized extensively by theory and experiment.

The anhydrous samples here should have little oxygen present, which is consistent with the 18 ns lifetime measured for TIPS-Pn here being towards the higher end of the previously reported lifetimes.The 8 mM TIPS-Pn TA spectra (Fig. )) show predominantly the same spectral features as the dilute sample, but with the addition of a peak at 504 nm that forms over the 8 ns window.The singlet features decrease in amplitude concurrent with the formation of this peak, as shown in Fig. 1(d). This additional peak is consistent with the ESA of a TIPS-Pn triplet exciton. ISC is a unimolecular process, and so it should cause the same amount of triplet formation at 0.05 mM as at 8 mM. Given negligible triplet formation was observed at 0.05 mM, the triplet formation observed at 8 mM must be due to SF. TA gives no indication of spin coherence, and so potentially the 504 nm peak could be assigned to the 1 (T...T) state.

analog of the coding theorem is by ˆÎ lnr = -Schumacher. It provides a basis for the quantum mechanical applications of information theory.How can one determine the state of the system leading to events that are most probable and therefore reproducible by repeated experiments? The maximal entropy approach seeks to reconstruct the density matrix of the system in its most probable state in a situation of incomplete knowledge, when only partial information about the system is available. The commonly discussed scenario is when we know N mean values for a set of operators typically called the constraints. In general this set of expectation values is not sufficient to uniquely determine the state. Among all density operators that are consistent with the given mean values of the constraints we select the one (unique) density of whose entropy is maximal.This density operator is represented as an exponential function of those operators whose mean values are given. For this density matrix, the surprisal is a linear function of the operators that are the constraints with coefficients that are the Lagrange multipliers that arise in seeking a maximum of the entropy subject to constraints. The linearity of the surprisal as a function of the constraints is especially convenient when the operators do not commute and an exponential form in the operators calls for special handling, e.g., Ref. 22.An established route for the computation of the dynamical evolution of the surprisal is via an algebraic procedure for the dynamics of the constraints in the Heisenberg picture. The equations of motion for the constraints are derived using their commutation relation with the Hamiltonian and can be solved analytically if the set of

We also discoved a rapid and regioselective isomerization of the exocyclic sprioketals to their endo-cyclic forms.Spiroketals are an important functional group in many natural products that possess potent medicinal properties. 1 As a result, they have increasingly become targets of interest by the pharmaceutical industry, 2 with ivermectin, 3 and tofogliflozin licensed as therapeutics (Scheme 1A).

SDAC simulation with transition forces does not vanish until about 6.3 ps. The deviation of the ξ full curve from the Tersoff/ZBL curve is consequently not as much as other AC and SDAC curves after 0.1 ps. This is not an advantage, however, since other aspects of the dynamics (such as v max ) become worse.The number of defects stabilizes as the system cools down to 300 K at about 10 ps. For SDAC with/without transition forces, the numbers of defects left at 10 ps are either in between that of the SW and the Tersoff/ZBL potentials or very close to that of the SW potential. For AC simulations, however, the numbers of defects left at 10 ps are much less. This demonstrates the deficiency of the AC method in the simulation of DD generation. The AC method can only partition the system according to geometrical criteria. With the AC method, the collision of atoms is treated with the higher-level method only after atoms are very close to each other, and is treated with the lowerlevel method when atoms are not close enough (Fig. ), so the description of the collision process is inconsistent. This affects the geometries of the defect clusters and leads to the much faster healing of damage. The entire collision process is described consistently by the higher-level method in SDAC simulations, and the resulting annealing behaviors in Fig. are more reasonable.Fig. shows the geometries of the amorphous disordered regions in the simulations at 0.15 ps and at 10 ps.

The B3LYP functional gives weaker binding energies than the CCSD(T) benchmarks, and prior work by Zhang et al. suggested that this under-binding becomes more pronounced with increasing molecular size. As such, B3LYP will incur significant errors for the large periodic strands, as we demonstrate in the next section. Based on these benchmark calculations, the B3LYP-D functional most closely matches the CCSD(T) results, particularly for the van-der-Waalsstacked monomers. In contrast, both the BLYP and B3LYP functionals produce geometries that are highly distorted in which the individual Watson-Crick base pairs are not even aligned in the same plane. A frequency analysis can give further information on structural stability; however, geometry optimizations of these large, periodic systems were already computationally expensive (requiring hundreds of thousands of CPU hours), and frequency calculations were out of reach for these structures. For this reason, we only present the structures in Figure , which clearly depict the base pairs to be misaligned with each other to depict the distortions/instabilities in these structures.

The convergence of the correlation energy is not so certain, and can be improved in three ways: i) by calculating correlation at a higher level of theory, ii) by using a larger basis set or adding diffuse and/or midpoint functions, or iii) by correlating all electrons in the calculation. Higher level correlation in dispersiondominated complexes of similar interaction energies was studied by Řezač and Hobza: the CCSDT(Q) correction to a CCSD(T) energy accounts for only 1-3% of the interaction energy. Due to the enormous computational cost of CCSDT(Q) calculations, we currently cannot investigate higher order effects on this system. Basis set incompleteness at the CCSD(T)/ [3,4]-ζ level is about ∼50 mÅ in the very weakly bound Ar• • •Ar complex, and decreases to ∼5 mÅ for a more strongly bound complex, such as NH 3 • •HF. The effect of increasing basis set size in the δ(T) component of the MP2+δ(T) recipe is shown in Fig. , in the left panel. Note that the O=C••S angle in the r (2) m structure ( ) is adjusted here by assuming the OCS monomer is linear. With increasing basis set size ( ), the intermonomer distance hardly changes, and the main difference is in the O=C••Xe angle. This further confirms that the structure is likely

Torsional Parameter FittingThe final backbone torsional parameters and associated errors in the recreation of the QM energy scans are given in Section S3.2 of the Supporting Information. For the alanine and glycine scans, the error for the QUBE force field evaluated using eq 5 is 1.25 kcal/mol compared to 0.93 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M, which is a reasonable level of agreement. For proline and serine, the errors remain comparable to OPLS-AA/M.For the sidechain torsional parameters (Section S3.3), the mean error in the recreation of the QM potential energy scans for the QUBE force field is 1.29 kcal/mol, compared to 1.12 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M. Particularly high errors occur for both the χ 1 and χ 2 glutamic acid scans, and the glutamine χ 2 scan. For glutamic acid, the error is also high for the OPLS-AA/M force field parameters, but the rotamer populations remained close to the experimental data, and this may be due to a problem with the functional form used in classical force fields. The OPLS-AA/M error in the potential energy scan for glutamine is roughly half that of the QUBE force field. However, as we will show, the accuracy of the glutamine dipeptide MD simulations is good, and so no further refinement was made to the sidechain torsional parameters in this work.Although a low error in the reproduction of the QM potential energy surface is clearly the desired result, this does not necessarily correspond to accurate non-bonded force field parameters. The degree to which torsional parameters can improve the fit between MM and QM scans depends not only on the accuracy of the non-bonded, and bond and angle, parameters, but also on the shape of the energy difference between the QM and MM scans.The functional form used in classical MM force fields is very restrictive. However, the energy difference between the QM and MM energy scans must be

DetectionThe influence of pulse length, coupling frequency distributions, and spectral linewidths on the traces recorded by pump-detect block are well studied in the context of dipolar spectroscopy. While these affect the form factor of the time traces, we do not need to consider them here as all DEERATom traces were recorded with the same pulse parameters and so will be affected equally. Thus for high fidelity readout the pump-detect block must be equally sensitive to in-and anti-phase coherences. This is conveniently demonstrated by simulating traces for which the initial state is either a pure in-or anti-phase coherence on the detection spin, using the ""single molecule"" model from previous simulations (Figure ). From this we conclude that the pump-detect block is an effective way to measure the expectation values of both in-and anti-phase coherences.

A column-mobile phase combination provided a maximum of eleven peaks under the conditions used (i.e., naphthyl column using acetonitrile as a co-solvent). This column was then used to study the effect of different chromatographic parameters on the separation (i.e., % co-solvent, backpressure, temperature, and flow rate).Backpressure and temperature showed non-linear behavior in the separation of the different OLED isomeric components in terms of resolution and retention. When using HPLC, the separation of the OLED isomeric sample showed co-elution and higher elution time. In contrast, analytical SFC offered a better resolution and faster separation speed than HPLC for the sample studied.

4.0 OLED compounds for several reasons. The HPLC separation of OLED compounds, especially in the case of structural homologs/analogs and geometric/optical isomers of OLEDs, often entails compromised resolution due to the lack of selectivity (tend to co-elute). Chromatographic method development for such structurally similar compounds and isomers is laborious and timeconsuming. Moreover, impurities or degradation products are often structurally very similar to the analytes; as a result, they elute on the front or tail of the main analyte peak or potentially remain hidden under the target chromatographic peak. In such a scenario, it becomes practically difficult for the analysts to detect and remove impurities from the main peak, especially in the preparative scale when the higher mass load becomes critical. In addition to the chromatographic resolution, HPLC analysis of OLEDs, in most cases, involves normal phase chromatography that utilizes 100% organic solvents as the mobile phase due to the low solubility of the most OLED compounds in the aqueous-based solvents. Utilization of such a high volume of organic solvent is hazardous from the environmental perspective and costly.Sivasubramaniam, et al. utilized three columns in series and used 100% acetonitrile as the mobile phase to separate a standard mixture of only four OLED compounds in about 50 minutes -this is an example of HPLC separation of OLEDs with a considerable waste of time and resources. Therefore, the utilization of preparative HPLC for the purification of OLEDs becomes a poor choice due to the requirement of excessive energy and high dry-down time to deal with such a high volume of organic solvent. This will also create a bottleneck in the postcollection workflow of the purification process and the overall productivity. It would be of great

ConclusionIn this paper, I extend the AC method of my previous work and develop an SDAC method to allow the active region centers in AP-QM/MM simulations to be determined on-the-fly according to speed-dependent properties, and I validate and demonstrate the method by applying it on the AP-MM/MM and AP-QM/MM simulations of the DD generation in bulk Si. AP-MM/MM simulations show that the SDAC method improves over the previous AC method, since the SDAC dynamics, number of defects, and the shape of the disordered region agrees better with those of the 'higherlevel' MM method than the AC results. Although the motivation for developing the SDAC method is for the simulation of the DD generation, the method is applicable to general problems in which active regions may occur or vanish during the simulation and have a speed dependence, such as the dynamics of shockwaves or collisions.The SDAC PES is speed-dependent, and the usual EOM in MD becomes inapplicable. I develop an energy-conserving SDAC EOM, which is different from Newton's second law by the SDEM term. The time integration of the non-standard EOM is carried out with the EPS algorithm. The dynamics of the SDAC QM/MM system can be expected to be close to that of the real system when the SDEM is much smaller than atomic masses. I show that the size of the SDEM can be effectively tuned by the functional form of the SDAC criterion property, which allows the SDAC method to be applicable in general systems.The transition forces in AP-QM/MM lead to geometry distortions and artificial heating. The same effect is observed in the SDAC simulations, and is found to be significant when the higher-level and lower-level methods of QM/MM differ a lot. I find that discarding the transition forces

There have been relatively few reports of peripherally functionalized Si-Pcs. The substituted pyrroles and phthalic acids required as starting materials are synthetically challenging and scarcely commercially available. Porphyrins, on the other hand, possess bridging methines connecting their pyrrole rings that serve as convenient handles for meso substitution. This meso substitution is readily achieved by simply forming the porphyrin from commercially available aldehydes, of which there are many. Therefore, a robust procedure for κ 4 Nsilylation of porphyrin derivatives is an appealing target that would provide access to PorSil materials that combine the electronic tuneability of porphyrins with the improved physical properties of Si-Pcs.Here, we describe a straightforward and general synthetic approach to PorSils (Scheme 1), which has allowed us to elaborate them into a new class of porphyrins, bissilyloxy PorSils (SOPS). Investigation of this series of SOPS (1a-i) based on 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP, 2) revealed that the axial substituents not only serve to solubilize the porphyrin but also to tune their optical and electronic properties.

residues generally does not stand far from the exact position of the metal ions observed in the X-ray structure. In a subsequent study, we preselected docking areas by filtering the distance from the metal to the β-carbon of the amino acids Asp, His, Glu and Cys, using a range from 2.5 to 5.0 Å. Both works showed that few geometric descriptors related to the backbone of the protein afford with convenient information to predict metalbinding sites rather than focusing only on the first coordination sphere donors (mainly side chains) that coordinate the metal.BioMetAll represents a major step forward in how to predict metal-binding sites in proteins. The approach stands on the geometric information extracted from a collection of about 171000 biological complexes to infer a combination of geometric rules that are used to evaluate the regions of a protein for metal binding. The program accurately reproduces the experimental metal-binding motifs on a benchmark of 53 structures. Furthermore, we present three specific case studies to illustrate its potential. BioMetAll is efficient to i) predict metal-binding sites with particular amino acid motifs even for non-canonical metal coordinating amino acids and backbone atoms; ii) determine transient metal-binding sites in structures that need conformational changes to reach the complete coordination sphere, which could be related to metal diffusion pathways; and even iii) predict potential mutations of an existing protein to generate convenient metal-binding sites. This new approach can make a significant contribution to future development in fields like metalloenzyme and metallodrug design.

the context of the mode following (MF) approaches discussed above, this can be understood because anharmonic torsional modes describe the transition between low-lying conformations. Although entropies and heat capacities are thermodynamic features encoded rather globally in the shape of the PES , conformations can be used to map the problem to well-defined points on the PES. More specifically, part of the absolute entropy is computed by an informational thermostatistic partition function (Gibbs-Shannon entropy ) that only depends on a given Boltzmann probability distribution of the conformers. This idea was pursued in the so-called ""minima mining"" approaches, where effects of anharmonicities are partially absorbed into the conformational entropy. As for the MF methods, a wide variety of different schemes exist, such as the so-called mutual information expansion (MIE) , or the maximum information spanning tree (MIST) procedures.

Probing Interfacial Effects on Ionization Energies: The Surprising Banality of Anion-Water Hydrogen Bonding at the Air/Water Interface Liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy is an increasingly common technique to measure vertical ionization energies (VIEs) of aqueous solutes, although the interpretation of these experiments is subject to questions regarding sensitivity to bulk versus interfacial solvation environments. Here, we compute aqueous-phase VIEs for a set of inorganic anions, some of which partition preferentially at the air/water interface, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. The results are in excellent agreement with experiment, regardless of whether the simulation data are restricted to ions at the air/water interface or to those in bulk liquid water. Although the computed VIEs are sensitive to ion-water hydrogen bonding, we find that the short-range solvation structure is sufficiently similar in the bulk and interfacial environments that it proves impossible to discriminate between the two on the basis of the VIE, a conclusion that has important implications for the interpretation of liquid-phase photoelectron spectroscopy. More generally, analysis of the simulation data suggests that partitioning of soft anions at the air/water interface is largely a second (or third) solvation shell effect, arising from disruption of water-water hydrogen bonds and not from significant changes in first-shell anion-water hydrogen bonding.

Question:
Why does the short-range solvation structure appear similar in both bulk and interfacial environments, making it impossible to discriminate between the two based on the VIE?

This 3D point plot shows the evolution of different generations of models as the genetic algorithm converges on a region of parameter space that produces maximal fibril yield for 2-ribbon type amyloid fibril structures. The cool color palette signifies the generation, with the deepest blues representing the latest generations. The warm color palette signifies the fibril yield for the top 20 fibril-producing parameters for each generation, where colors closest to yellow indicate the highest fibril yields. Four pale pink dots, which are referred to as generation 0, are used to highlight the four initial parameters found via a brute force approach. The parameter discovered by the genetic algorithm that produced the highest mean fibril yield (.77) is shown as a large yellow dot. Fibril yields indicated are the mean of 16 repetitions for all parameter values tested.

This potential prebiotic importance, coupled with a more reducing early-Earth environment that may have generated metal carbonyl motifs, prompted us to investigate whether simple metal carbonyl compounds could play a role in COS generation, particularly under thermal rather than photochemical reactions. Furthermore, we also viewed this as a viable platform to investigate whether similar chemistry could be observed from the heaver chalcogen congener Se as a platform for carbonyl selenide (COSe) formation. Both of these approaches would provide new insights into the metal-mediated crosstalk between CO and reactive sulfur and selenium species.

The essential difference is that for a mixed state this can be an equation for a set of mean values that is sufficient to fully specify the state. For a pure state these expectation values are not necessarily sufficient. There can be density matrices of finite entropy that are consistent with the given expectation values. It then takes additional expectation values to reduce the maximal value of the entropy towards zero. But as a practical matter these finite number of equations can be sufficient for an excellent numerical approximation. This will be particularly so when the operators and the density are expressed as matrices in a finite but sufficiently large basis. When we work in a finite basis in the limiting case of a pure state a diagonalized surprisal matrix will have only one eigenvector with an eigenvalue close to zero, and the other eigenvalues being larger negative numbers. The density matrix, cf. Eq.

Wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia and economic indicatorsAn essential economic indicator for evaluating the economic feasibility of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production is the discount rate. The discount rate represents the rate of return used to evaluate the present value and cash flow of a project.The chosen discount rate depends on the inflation rate, risk, and the funding source, with government funding having lower discount rates than private funding. The determination of an appropriate discount rate is complex, requiring a holistic approach that considers market distortions caused by subsidies, the technicalities of integrating renewables into existing systems, and the social implications of community involvement. Moreover, it necessitates a comprehensive analysis of various factors, including interest rates, expected returns, the time frame of the analysis, and risk premiums, while also adapting to extraordinary conditions such as pandemics, global conflicts, climate issues, and other unique challenges associated with renewable energy projects.

and the bimolecular rate constant would no longer be applicable. Using the rate constants fit to a system with aggregates would overestimate the rates at more dilute, diffusion-limited concentrations. The underestimation of triplet excitons at 8 mM by the Dover model is partially explained by the underestimation of SF and overestimation of excimer formation: if excimers predominantly result from aggregates and are absent at lower concentrations, then collisions at 8 mM are more likely to result in SF, and more triplet formation.Additionally, the presence of aggregates would explain the fast rate of triplet fusion at high TIPS-Tn concentration. If SF at 300 mM occurs on an aggregated pair of TIPS-Tn molecules, then the triplets are not well separated spatially and can recombine quickly. However, in a dilute solution with no aggregates, in which SF occurs during transient collisions, the molecules may diffuse away before the triplets recombine. Therefore the triplet fusion rate would be lower and a more significant amount of triplets would be observed. We note that the presence of aggregates at 300 mM does not affect the main conclusion of the study by Dover et al., i.e., that the excimer is a trap state rather than an intermediate. However, for the remainder of this study, we revert to the much simpler model shown in Eqs. ( ) and ( ) to describe SF in this system.As mentioned previously, we neglect the reverse SF process, triplet fusion, in this model. This assumption is justified in TIPS-Pn, as fusion is energetically uphill. For both TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn, the model fits well without triplet fusion, and so presumably it plays only a minor role. The other assumption made here is that the ISC rate is negligible compared to SF, but, as we show below, this assumption may not necessarily be the case.

ConclusionThe combination of trajectory surface hopping on potentials parametrized in the linear vibronic coupling model is an efficient approach to perform photodynamics simulations. For transition metal complexes, despite their typically large number of vibrational degrees of freedom and many close-lying electronic states, it becomes affordable to screen the nonadiabatic dynamics of many individual ones in order to test and establish design principles to improve their photophysical and photochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate this by screening the photophysics of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes derived from VCl 3 (ddpd). This complex, after excitation from the triplet ground state and following intersystem crossing to the singlet manifold, shows singlet-to-triplet phosphorescence in the nearinfrared region. Based on an analysis of the relaxation mechanism of VCl 3 (ddpd), we developed the hypothesis that by increasing the ligand-field strength in the complex could shift the electronic states to modify the mechanism in such a way as to lead to a higher phosphorescence yield. This was to be achieved by channeling more population from the triplet to the singlet states as well as reducing the amount of singlet-to-triplet reverse intersystem crossing that reduces the population available for phosphorescence.We then tested our hypothesis in two steps. First, we designed 18 complexes based on design principles established for other 3dmetal complexes with large ligand-field splitting. Thereby we found that strategies of including ligands that are strong σ -donors or both σ and π donors are particularly successful. Among the 18 candidates complexes, we identified four complexes with ligandfield splitting

Aliquots were taken out at time intervals and heated at 100 °C for 10 minutes to inactivate the enzyme. Then the MIC of degradation solution was measured.

Probing the spin dynamics of 1 with pulsed EPR methods, echo-detected field-swept EPR (EDFS; see Supplementary Information) spectra (19) of 1 in THF are entirely consistent with CW-EPR; these spectra persist up to temperatures limited only by thawing of the solvent. In order to investigate the spin dynamics of 1 at higher temperatures, we studied a single crystal of 1@5 which gives identical g and A Y parameters to the frozen THF solution of 1, and confirms the assignment of the principal directions of g z and g x,y with respect to the molecular structure (Figs. 2a, S3 and S4). For a single crystal of 1@5, we find spin echoes between 5 and 300 K (Fig. ).Relaxation measurements show that T 1 is approximately 10 -20 ms below 10 K, but remains as long as 1 μs at 300 K, while T m varies between 2 and 0.4 μs in the same temperature range (Fig. ; Tables and). T 1 and T m are very similar between frozen solution and single crystal measurements,showing that the spin dynamics of 1 are independent of the phase of the sample; this is also remarkable because the THF (C 4 H 8 O) solvent is rich with 1 H nuclear spins.

mmstructure is troublesome, despite including the O isotopologue in the fit. At 1.094 Å, the O=C bond is unphysically short, and the O-C-S angle is over 180 • , meaning the OCS molecule deflects away from the Ne atom. Unfortunately, fixing individual OCS parameters leads to a much poorer fit.When the O=C distance is fixed to the equilibrium value, the structure fit doesn't converge, unless both C=S length and O-C-S angle are also fixed. The best option seems to be to fix the O-C-S angle to 180 • . This forces the O=C bond to shrink even further, but brings the C••Ne bond length within 14 mÅ of the MP2+δ(T) value.

To analyze the magnetic configurations, we use αβ Mulliken Population Analysis (MPA). This analysis revealed that the magnetic state of intercalated TMs is dependent on the concentration: Co and V intercalations are FM for configurations TM-01 through TM-04, but FiM for the TM-05 configuration. Cu intercalation is non-magnetic throughout all configurations. Finally, Cr, Fe, Mn, Sc, and Ti intercalations can be FM, AFM, or FiM, depending on TM concentration.Furthermore, in these compounds, the magnetic behavior of intercalated atoms can be highly dependent not only on their concentration, but also on their position. In particular, we highlight that some TM atoms have reduced unpaired electron density depending on their position. For example, for Cr intercalation, the αβ (unpaired) electron population is larger for Cr atoms intercalated at the centroid of boroxine or triazine rings, compared to those intercalated at the centroid of benzene rings, with the exception of Cr-02 where magnetic moments are reduced in triazine rings. In the Ni-04 and Ni-05 configurations, MPA indicates reduced spin density for Ni atoms intercalated in boroxine and triazine rings, compared to benzene rings. Sc-02 and Sc-04 have a reduced number of unpaired electrons for atoms intercalated at the centroid of triazine rings, and Sc-03 has a very small amount of unpaired electron density for all Sc atoms. Finally, for Ti intercalation, the only atoms that show open-shell configurations are those intercalated at the centroid of boroxine rings. It is important to note that, even though MPA gives a good indication of the type of magnetic configuration (FM, FiM, AFM, NM) for the intercalated TM atoms, it is known to yield inaccurate results for the number of unpaired electrons due to an overestimation of bonds' covalent

formations of aryl pivalates at remote C(sp 2 )-H sites. Thus, we turned our attention to study the reactivity of Ni-Ni species with an appropriate nucleophilic counterpart (Scheme 7). As anticipated, 1-phenylnaphthalene 9 (61%) was exclusively obtained upon exposure of 1 to PhMgBr at rt after 1 h. Under the limits of detection, not even traces of 2-phenylnaphthalene 10 were detected in the crude mixtures. Interestingly, however, statistical mixtures of 9:10 were found by addition of PhMgBr after exposure of 1 to 50 ºC for 6 h, thus confirming that ""ringwalking"" might constitute a new vehicle for enabling bond formation at distal C(sp 2 )-H bonds of aryl pivalates. An otherwise similar scenario was observed when conducting the Kumada-Corriu reaction of 3 and 5 (Scheme 7). While these results require stoichiometric amounts of Ni, our data should be assessed against the challenge that is addressed. Indeed, our protocol represents the first time that distal C(sp 2 )-H functionalizations can be enabled by ""ring-walking"" aided by Ni complexes, thus paving the way for designing future Ni-catalyzed endeavors triggered by a dynamic translocation of the metal center throughout the arene backbone. a ipso-Functionalization: 1, 3 or 5 (0.01-0.03 mmol), PhMgBr (1 equiv) in C6D6 (0.06 M), rt, 1 h.

carbon K-edge NEXAFS spectra (Figure ) show intense * resonances at low photon energy (284 to 287 eV) and less intense * resonances at higher photon energies (>287 eV). The first * resonance of pyrene has two maxima, which are caused by the C1s→LUMO and C1s→LUMO+1 excitations, as was ascertained by MO-projected NEXAFS simulations (see Figure in the SI and Ref. ). For azupyrene, the individual excitations in the first peak are not resolved, because the corresponding LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals are too close in energy. For both molecules, the MO-projected NEXAFS simulations show that the leading edge of the adsorption peak is determined by the C1s→LUMO excitation.The X-ray absorption edge of azupyrene appears at a lower photon energy by 0.37 eV than that of pyrene, as can be seen in Figure . Since the core-level energies differ only marginally, it can therefore be concluded that the LUMO of azupyrene is lower in energy. Theory also predicts the LUMO of azupyrene to be lower in energy, here the magnitude is 0.60 eV.Combination of the experimental differences of electron addition and removal energies from UPS and NEXAFS data indicate that the electronic band gap is 0.72 eV (= 0.37 eV + 0.35 eV) smaller for azupyrene than for pyrene. For comparison, the calculations yield a value of 0.87 eV for the difference in electronic band gap, which is in good agreement with the experimental finding. In addition, the calculations can provide the absolute electronic band gaps, which are not accessible by the experimental techniques at our disposal. The calculated absolute electronic band gaps are 2.96 eV and 3.83 eV for azupyrene and pyrene, respectively.

As in GCEQ or CCEQ setup, potential is developed due to the charge accumulation on electrode surface, it is expected that surface polarity of the electrode is the key factor for the generated potential. Thus, we may expect mesoporous carbon electrode may be a very good nonmetal electrode we are searching for. This is used in IDM which supports this proposal. In Fig.  For CCEQ setup, we need co-coexistence of sea water and river water or pond water. The natural source is of course where a river mixes with the sea. But, we can't only depend on natural sources as it is limited and in some cases may not be suitable for contraction of a power station.

Furthermore, pipelines can be easily saved, reused and shared to foster the development of a repository of preprocessing protocols. As a seed to this repository, RamanSPy provides a library of assembled preprocessing protocols (custom pre-defined, or adapted from the literature ), which users can access and exploit.To illustrate the pipelining functionalities, we use RamanSPy to construct three preprocessing protocols by compiling selected methods in the desired order of execution, and applying them out-of-the-box to data loaded into the platform (Fig. ).

IntroductionThe polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene serves as an important building block for semiconductors used in organic electronic devices. Pyrene-based materials have found application in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs). One of the most important driving forces enabling the use of pyrene over a wide range of applications is the possible functionalization of its molecular backbone. Accordingly, previous research in the field has focused on modifying the properties of pyrene by introducing substituents at the periphery of the molecule or by incorporating pyrene units into semiconducting polymers. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the -electron system on the properties of pyrene has not yet been addressed.During the past years, the importance of topology for the molecular properties of organic semiconductors has been increasingly recognized. The inherent promise for performance improvements resulted in a revived interest in nonalternant -electron systems and first efforts to use the related molecules in (opto)electronic devices have been made.

This electrochemical behavior suggests that the observed redox activity within the scanned potential window results from the interactions between the Cu-HHTP MOF film and the PFA.Though oxygen reduction side reactions are anticipated in our testing conditions contributing overall charge neutrality in solution, Cu-HHTP is able to maintain a stable oxidized structure as shown in Figure a upon adsorption of the PFAS.To probe this oxidative interaction of Cu-HHTP and fluorinated compounds at a molecular level, we carried out systematic elemental analysis using XPS and compared the pristine Cu-HHTP films to those exposed to PFAS. XPS spectra of Cu-HTTP films before and after exposure to PFOA solutions revealed substantial changes in oxidation states on the MOF's coordination center as shown in Figure d, e and Fig. . Noticeably, after exposure, the relative ratio of Cu 1+ to Cu +2 in the MOF decreased, indicating that the presence of PFAS results in substantial changes in the oxidation state of the copper atoms, which as stated above, are key species towards maintaining charge neutrality within the MOF. The observed changes in oxidation state of copper should be accompanied by changes in binding energy of the oxygen atoms along the periphery of the copper center, which is what we observe after exposing Cu-HHTP to PFOA.

Therefore, it seems that there is a critical concentration of organic modulator that promotes the formation of Zr-MOFs structures with larger pores in both the micro and mesoporous size ranges. The ensemble of the results presented in this section agrees with literature reports , showing that the modulator serves to control the porosity of Zr-MOFs. However, as far as we know, these reports have not explored the role of the concentration of the organic modulator as presented herein. In this sense, one of the contributions of this work was establishing how the concentration of an organic modulator alters the porosity and surface area of Zr-MOFs of the 808 type in particular ways.

Furthermore, using two different caging groups in a chemical dimerizer, bidirectional photocontrol of protein localization and diffusion has been achieved in a single cycle . However, caged CID systems, in principle, cannot be repetitively switched on and off, unlike optogenetic tools.In this study, we developed a 'photochromic CID' system, which allows repetitive protein dimerization and dissociation by light. The photochromic CID system consists of two protein tags and a dimerizer tethering a covalent ligand for one tag and a photochromic ligand for the other tag. Photoreversible protein dimerization is achieved by photoisomerization of the photochromic ligand, enabling protein translocation to various subcellular compartments. This system allowed bidirectional control of protein association and diffusion by dualwavelength light irradiation and achieved fast and durable localization of the target proteins. Furthermore, the translocation level of the target protein was varied by the irradiation light wavelength or the combination of dualwavelength light with different intensities. Finally, this system was applied for the optical induction of mitophagy by regulating the subcellular localization of PINK1.

An identical setup was used to measure the same crystal by echo-detected pulsed-EPR methods (see 2. ). We note that molecules pack in the crystal in different ways, being classified in two groups: A and B, whose C 3 axes (that is the axis perpendicular to the plane made by the centroids of the three Cp' ligands bound to Y 2+ ) are orthogonal. As such, we have chosen to rotate the crystal around the C 3 axis of one of such molecules, in order to access such an orientation that molecules B would have their C 3 axis parallel to the static B 0 field (Fig. ), while molecules A remained aligned with C 3 perpendicular to B 0 .

this approach have recently been explored to improve photophysical and electrochemical performance. Phthalocyanines (Pcs) have been used for many of the same applications as porphyrin compounds. Like porphyrins, Pcs are planar and suffer from poor solubilities. However, an elegant approach to improve their physical properties has been to silylate the center of the Pc, introducing axially oriented groups that shield the aromatic surface. Beyond its effect on solubility, silylation modifies the optical and electronic profiles of Pcs, which has led to over 1000 papers discussing the synthesis, properties, and applications of silylated Pcs (Si-Pcs). Curiously, however, there is a relative dearth of literature describing such functionalization of the parent porphyrin compounds, which is presumably due to the relatively harsh conditions and operationally complex protocols used to incorporate the central silicon atom. While Si-Pcs are formed in the presence of SiCl4 to i) template the macrocyclization and ii) silylate in situ, porphyrin silanes (PorSils) have been synthesized by first making the porphyrin and then inserting the silicon by forming the [porphyrin] 2-species with a strong and difficult-to-handle amide base under strictly anhydrous conditions. Sun and co-workers were able to silylate two porphyrins using HSiCl3 and a tertiary amine base. However, purification of the resulting PorSil dichloride requires chromatography on neutral alumina, which makes the protocol too inefficient and expensive to be applied as a general method on a large scale. Furthermore, this protocol can be difficult to reproduce as the PorSil dichloride can react with the alumina sorbent via nucleophilic substitution of a chloride.This lack of

J o u r n a l Na me Computational Screening of Photodynamics of Transition-Metal Complexes † The design of photoactive compounds is challenging due to the complicated nature that the ensuing photodynamics can assume. The complexity of this problem increases with the size and flexibility of the system, and the challenge becomes especially difficult in the rational design of open-shell transition-metal complexes where many electronic states and nuclear degrees of freedom participate in the excited-state dynamics. The only alternative is then to screen larger numbers of compounds as is done in the present work using computer simulations for a class of near-infrared emitting vanadium(III) complexes. Starting from the mechanism of the known emitter VCl 3 (ddpd) (ddpd = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-dipyridine-2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine), we establish design principles including an increase in the ligand-field strength in the complex in order to achieve higher emission quantum yields. Based on these principles, we design a large set of complexes that are tested for larger ligandfield splitting in static quantum chemistry calculations. For the subset of complexes with increased ligand-field splitting, we then perform nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and identify two promising near-infrared emitter with potential similar or increased emission quantum yield compared to the VCl 3 (ddpd) reference. An analysis of the mechanisms of all studied complexes reveals individual relaxation pathways for each compound, confirming the difficulty of the identifying useful rational design principles in these photoactive open-shell transition-metal complexes.

This workA) B) No significant amount of side-products was observed by HPLC analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of reaction has never been described before and represents a new type of crossover system. The literature describes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis/alcoholysis of sulfinamides, and recently, two groups have reported transulfinamidation of primary sulfinamides with an excess of (hydroxyl)amines under metal catalysis. These are the closest examples of similar sulfinamide reactivity. Encouraged by the initial results, we set off to determine the scope of this reaction. First, the N-substituents were varied. Various tertiary sulfinamides with cyclic and acyclic aliphatic N-substituents underwent the crossover reaction with high yields, resulting in an almost equimolar mixture of products as determined by HPLC (Fig. ). Sulfinamides 1f and 2fbearing basic tertiary amino group can also serve as substrates for the crossover when 0.4 equivs of TFA catalyst is utilized. Secondary sulfinamides are also suitable substrates, as exemplified by Fig. entry 6. Interestingly, secondary sulfinamides 1h and 2h with an electron-poor aromatic N-substituent also provided the crossover products. Next, the combination of substrates 1a and 3b with S-aromatic and S-aliphatic substituents was tested.Despite the slower reaction rate (24 h reaction), a significant amount of the crossover products was also observed (entry 8). All crossover reactions of two substrates were performed in both directions, starting with a different set of substrates.

Relating fluorescence to hydroxide ion concentrationThe simulation of Fick's law with the stated boundary and initial conditions provides the concentration gradients of hydroxide ion (or hydrogen ion) at any distance from the impingement zone along a radial line. These concentrations must be related to fluorescence intensity.A series of photographs from a typical experiment are shown in Figure . ImageJ software was used to analyze the fluorescence profiles of the photographs . The photographs were imported into ImageJ as a stack, which creates a stack of equally sized images that are superimposed one on top of the other. A radial line from the origin of the single sheets to just beyond the end of the mixed sheet is drawn on one of the images in the stack. ImageJ will then place the radial line at the exact same location on the other images in the stack. After the radial line is drawn, a profile of the gray scale values (a proxy for the fluorescence intensity) for each pixel along the radial line is created for each image in the stack.The profiles of fluorescence intensity with time for the radial lines of all solutions were exported to a spreadsheet for further analysis. The measured fluorescence intensities, however, need to be adjusted to subtract the background fluorescence . The background fluorescence (expressed as a gray scale pixel intensity) was subtracted from the ImageJ measured gray scale intensities using method 1 listed in reference .

analog of the coding theorem is by ˆÎ lnr = -Schumacher. It provides a basis for the quantum mechanical applications of information theory.How can one determine the state of the system leading to events that are most probable and therefore reproducible by repeated experiments? The maximal entropy approach seeks to reconstruct the density matrix of the system in its most probable state in a situation of incomplete knowledge, when only partial information about the system is available. The commonly discussed scenario is when we know N mean values for a set of operators typically called the constraints. In general this set of expectation values is not sufficient to uniquely determine the state. Among all density operators that are consistent with the given mean values of the constraints we select the one (unique) density of whose entropy is maximal.This density operator is represented as an exponential function of those operators whose mean values are given. For this density matrix, the surprisal is a linear function of the operators that are the constraints with coefficients that are the Lagrange multipliers that arise in seeking a maximum of the entropy subject to constraints. The linearity of the surprisal as a function of the constraints is especially convenient when the operators do not commute and an exponential form in the operators calls for special handling, e.g., Ref. 22.An established route for the computation of the dynamical evolution of the surprisal is via an algebraic procedure for the dynamics of the constraints in the Heisenberg picture. The equations of motion for the constraints are derived using their commutation relation with the Hamiltonian and can be solved analytically if the set of

NN potentials would have large uncertainty for configurations of these regions. Based on this fact, Behler and co-workers exploited the high flexibility of the NN to search the poorly sampled regions of the configuration space. Namely, if some points possess large energy deviations between two NN fits, they were added to the training set. Recently, Lin et al. proposed a trajectory-free active learning method, based on this idea, to iteratively add new data points for sampling. It has been demonstrated that an accurate PES can be developed with much fewer points than the trajectory-based methods.In this work, we also utilize the limited extrapolation capabilities of NN potential to select points from the DFT dataset.

These results suggested that product inhibition is important as the rate of dissociation of the template:product strongly influences the success of the self-replication. Yet the overall stability of the intermediate complex also plays a significant role, which had until now been overlooked. In addition, simulations were conducted with 5 x kcat and 0.2 kcat to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the rate of ligation. When the kcat is 5 times faster than the value determined from our best fit of the data, the self-replication was much faster than what we observed. Conversely, the ligation rate was much slower when kcat was reduced by a factor of (0.2 x kcat), resulting in slow amplification of the templates (Figure ). These simulations are consistent with previous work that showed a strong dependence of replication on the magnitude of kcat of ligation. These simulations reveal two important take-home messages for developers of nonenzymatic self-replicating systems: they should focus on ways to stabilize the intermediate complex as well as ways to destabilize the product duplex and select rapid ligation strategies.

SIGNIFICANCENecroptosis is a well-characterized form of caspase-independent regulated cell death that is involved in numerous diseases. A hallmark of necroptosis is the membrane permeabilization and rupture that is mediated by mixed linage kinase like protein (MLKL). This membrane rupture is linked to the inflammatory properties of necroptosis and is critical for disease states involving this process. It is established that electrostatic interactions between phosphatidyl inositol phosphates and phosphorylated MLKL (pMLKL) oligomers facilitate the membrane recruitment of pMLKL. In efforts to understand how lipids might contribute to necroptosis, we previously showed that saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulate and that they are functionally involved in this process. Our results also indicated that protein fatty acylation by VLCFAs can be a mechanism by which VLCFAs contribute to this process. Here we define the scope of protein acylation by saturated VLCFAs during necroptosis. First we show that, although there is an overall decrease in acylation, some proteins, including MLKL and pMLKL, are exclusively acylated during necroptosis. Reducing the levels of VLCFAs decreases the membrane recruitment of MLKL and pMLKL and rescues from cell death, suggesting that acylation by VLCFAs contributes to membrane localization of pMLKL and subsequent membrane permeabilization. Acylation of MLKL and pMLKL occur downstream of phosphorylation and oligomerization and appear to be S-linked. Second, we show that disruption of clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway results in a strong rescue in cell viability during necroptosis, likely by removal of pMLKL from the plasma membrane. Altogether, we show for the first time that MLKL and pMLKL can be acylated during necroptosis. We also show that disruption of endocytosis presents a promising strategy to delay membrane permeabilization and cell death during necroptosis

Present in about 30% of the known genome, their impacts on molecular and cellular processes are countless. Since biometallic complementarities sustain many mechanisms in living systems, they are essential for their adaptation to the environment and key to their health. Understanding how metallic moieties interact with biological systems is not just a healthrelated question. It is also a source of inspiration for the development of new synthetic routes, including environmentally friendly ones. As such, chemists have long intended to mimic biometallic synergies for industrial purposes.

The triplet decay rate constant was fixed to 1/80 µs -1 , taken from the lifetime used by Dover et al.. Again, the triplet lifetime is substantially longer than the timescales measured here, and has little effect on the fit.The resulting kinetic model fits are shown in Fig. , where again the shaded gray region represents the range of possible kinetics that fit the triplet concentration. This model is able to capture the behavior of TIPS-Tn reasonably well. The triplet formation kinetics are reproduced well, and the singlet decay has some small discrepancies, which, as with TIPS-Pn, we attribute to solvent reorganization or the presence of some additional S 1 deactivation pathways.

This further confirms that the structure is likely near convergence with respect to basis set size.We have investigated two additional basis set effects: counterpoise correction for the basis set superposition error, and the effect of diffuse functions. The former has no significant effect on the structure, as the difference in the monomer separation obtained from MP2+δ(T) and CP-MP2+δ(T) is only 0.001 Å. On the other hand, the aug-MP2+δ(T) structure obtained with cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z basis sets augmented by diffuse functions (see in Fig. ) is remarkably close to the experimental r(2) m structure, with a disagreement in the monomer separation of only 15 mÅ. While this is most certainly a step in the direction, the increased computational cost compared to cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z calculations is immense: the augmentation of the basis set increases the number of basis functions by 20%, and the amount of memory required for the computation of the connected triples (ie. the (T) component) more than doubles. Notably, additive terms obtained from the differences of augmented and unaugmented 3-ζ calculations that are used in various extrapolation recipes do not perform well for non-covalent complexes. Therefore CCSD(T) computations with augmented 4-ζ basis sets might be unavoidable.Unfortunately, the currently available set of ""aug-cc-pwCVnZ""-quality basis sets is limited to the first two periods in the main group and first row transition metals, and appropriate density fitting basis sets are also unavailable.When the effect of correlating all core electrons is added to the MP2+δ(T) potential surface ( ), the minimum in the potential moves even further away from the r m structure is a case of obtaining a correct answer for the wrong reasons.

(b). A similar trend is observed at the anode as the cathode; namely, at lower current densities there is limited acoustic activity, indicating low bubble formation, which gradually increases as the areal current density is increased. If the number of hits recorded at the anode (Figure6(b)) is compared to the number of hits recorded under the same conditions at the cathode (Figure6(a)), fewer hits are observed at each current density, suggesting lower acoustic activity indicating lower bubble formation. These results correlate with the data obtained from voltage fluctuation experiments, which indicated that bubble formation was more prevalent at the cathode than the anode. Figure 6 .6Figure 6.

For the simulation of acid reacting with base, it is assumed that the 𝑂𝐻 -concentration within the slice is constant; the thinner the slice, the more accurate this assumption is. However, no improvement in simulation results was seen when the number of slices was increased from 100 to 150 per half slab. 𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 is the fluorescence, at a distance of 𝑟 pixels from the impingement zone, of a constant [𝑂𝐻 -] mixed sheet, which has the same [𝑂𝐻 -] as the jth slice. 𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 is determined from the 4PL equation relating fluorescence to hydroxyl ion concentration at 𝑟 (Eq. 23). As discussed earlier, this 4PL equation was determined from the constant pH solutions, and use of the equation yields a calculated fluorescence for the mixed sheet and not the slice. To determine the fluorescence for the slice (𝐹𝐼 𝑗,𝑟 ), 𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 is multiplied by 𝛥𝑦 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 ⁄ .The fluorescence for the entire slab, 𝐹𝐼 2𝐿,𝑟 , can be obtained by adding up the calculated fluorescence of each slice contained within the slab (the number of slices for all simulations was equal to 200 over the diffusive slab thickness, -𝐿 to +𝐿). The equation is: where 𝐹𝐼 𝑗,𝑟 has been replaced by Eq. 24. Since 𝛥𝑦 is constant and 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 is also constant at the specific pixel, 𝑟,𝐹𝐼 2𝐿,𝐹𝐼 2𝐿,𝑟 = 𝛥𝑦 𝑠 𝑚,𝑟 ∑ (𝐹𝐼 ̅̅̅ 𝑂𝐻 𝑗 -,𝑟 ) 200 𝑗=1(26)The experimental results only provided the fluorescence for the mixed sheet thickness along the radial line at a distance 𝑟 from the impingement zone.

Such a trend is not quantitatively confirmed by the PBE0 data, which predict the dissociated form more stable by 0.88 kcal/mol and a shuttling barrier of 0.95 kcal/mol. However, the PBE0 results confirm that the energy difference between the two structures is limited, therefore we can conclude that the 0 K energy differences involving monodentate HCOOH are all within 1 kcal/mol, irrespective of the level of theory.For the two PBE minima we have calculated the harmonic frequencies (see Table ): in line with the spectrum from the 300 K simulation (Figure ), there are no OH signals at wavenumbers higher than 3000 cm -1 , and the CH modes are found at much higher energy than the acid proton modes. Such low values for the ν(OH) wavenumbers are due to very strong molecule-surface hydrogen bonding, as indicated by the O s -O f separation found for the undissociated and dissociated minima -2.479 Å and 2.463 Å, respectively.

The optical gap determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy must be distinguished from the electronic gap, which is defined as the difference between the electron affinity and the ionization potential. While strictly speaking not equivalent, this is often approximated with the DFT orbital energy difference between HOMO and LUMO. We were able to obtain direct information about the electronic gap of the two molecules by UPS (Figure ) and NEXAFS (Figure ), which probe the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively.The peaks observed in the UV photoelectron (UP) spectra (Figure ) can be discussed in correspondence to Kohn-Sham orbital energies obtained by gas-phase DFT calculations. The comparison of gas-phase calculations to spectroscopic measurements of molecular crystals is a common approximation, and is justified by the fact that the weak intermolecular van der Waals interactions in the solid film usually have only a very small influence on the electronic states. We also performed periodic calculations of the molecular crystals to prove this point for our systems. The results of these calculations are shown in Figure of the supporting information (SI).Experimentally, the first electron removal energy, which we can associate with the highest occupied state of azupyrene, is situated at a binding energy of 2.10 eV, which is by 0.35 eV higher in energy for pyrene (2.45 eV). The difference of 0.35 eV is in reasonable agreement with the energy difference of the HOMOs of 0.27 eV provided by DFT calculations.

The iterative diagonalization procedure is considered converged once the space spanned by the columns of Ši is found to contain the leftmost eigenvector of ȞL .As mentioned in section 2.2, displacements in the internal coordinate space must be realized as changes to the Cartesian coordinates x, as these are the independent coordinate variables. In our algorithm, these displacements are realized using a geodesic internal coordinate stepping approach we have previously developed for minimization in a redundant internal coordinate basis. At each iteration of the diagonalization algorithm, the part of the Hessian which has already been evaluated Hi = YT i Ši is exactly diagonalized to find the leftmost eigenvalue θ i and eigenvector zi . This eigenvector, when projected into the larger nonredundant internal coordinate space through the relation ži = Ši zi , approximates the leftmost eigenvector of ȞL . The diagonalization procedure is repeated until the convergence criterion ři 2 < γ|θ i | is met, where ři = Yi zi -θ i ži is the residual vector and γ is a unitless convergence parameter which defaults to 0.1 in Sella.

To quantify the change in stability in terms of ΔH and ΔS, the DNA hybridization of the product and intermediate complexes was followed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which is widely used to measure the thermodynamic parameters of molecular interactions based on the isotherm obtained during titration with one of the complementary molecules or strands. Thermodynamic parameters were measured from the ITC analysis of various DNA complexes at approximately 5 °C lower than the complex's melting temperature to obtain the ΔH, ΔS and K that are associated with the formation (hybridization) of product duplexes and intermediate complexes (Table ). Thermodynamic parameters showed that the product duplex with thymidine exhibited much stronger binding affinities at 30 °C than that with the abasic group (1.98 x 10 12 M -1 vs 1.03 x 10 8 M -1 , respectively).

These functional materials based on [2,2] paracylophane exhibit cofacially π-stacked aromatic systems, and show optoelectronic properties holding intramolecular through space conjugation and charge transfer features. 1, The extraordinary face-to-face arrangement of two slightly-bent aromatic rings, with a short distance of 2.83-3.09Å while the typical π -π stacking distance of graphite is 3.35 Å. This shorter inter-ring distance leads to strong orbital overlap allowing an effective transannular charge transfer between the phenyl rings. This results in efficient charge and energy transfer within the [2,2] paracylophanes skeleton via through-bond and space channels. In addition to these special properties its synthetic diversities and feasibility of its derivative provide an opportunity to investigate the structural relationship in terms of its orientation, and functionalization as through-space conjugation is highly sensitive to the molecular geometry and electronic structures. This charge delocalization and energy transfer was explained by theoretical results which indicate the energy band gap between the molecular orbital of [2,2] paracyclophane is 3.72 eV which is about 1.4 eV smaller than that of benzene (5.15 eV), demonstrating it is more effective and expansive π-conjugated

Undeniably, the governmental policies aimed at abating carbon emissions in mobility are of great importance, too.The requirements for introducing hydrogen for powering MDVs and HDVs are similar to LDVs, although these vehicles present challenges (in particular for HDVs) due to the more stringent operational requirements with respect to LDVs. For example, while an average LDV might drive ~20.000 km per year, a long-haul truck drives at least three times more (~60.000 km/year) and the overall number of driven with an HDV before decommissioning is significantly higher than for an LDV. The increased lifetime and operating hours of an HDV mean that the current generation of PEM fuel cells (that were perfected for LDVs as it was the primary driver for their development) cannot follow the more stringent requirements for HDVs (and some MDVs as well).

We decided to take advantage of the parallelization offered by 96-well plates to propose a Stern-Volmer plate design which involves increasing quencher concentration moving down a column, with a different quencher (or replicate) in each column (Figure ). Multichannel pipettors enabled the rapid dispensing of each component across the entire plate. To maintain a strict inert atmosphere around the samples, the entire sample preparation and measurement was performed under inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen filled glovebox in constant purge mode. This was made possible by the small footprint of the fluorescence plate reader, which can easily be introduced into a glovebox. To validate this design, we sought to test our approach by comparing Ksv values obtained with our workflow to values reported in the literature. We probed the quenching of (2,2'-Bipyridine)bis[2pyridinyl-N)phenyl-C]iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) by diethylbromomalonate, bromoacetonitrile and indole in dichloroethane (DCE) and observed similar trends in the quenching values, with diethylbromomalonate exhibiting a higher Ksv than bromoacetonitrile by a factor of 1.7 (in the original report, the factor is 2) and indole showing virtually no quenching (Figure ).  However, we measured higher quenching constants overall by a factor of ~2. This difference is likely because of our ability to consistently maintain the sample in an inert atmosphere throughout the entire measurement using this workflow.With this positive validation result in hand, we sought to showcase the magnitude of quenching data accessible through this high-throughput method.

Hydrogen in mobilityMobility has been the most discussed application of hydrogen in the past decades. Since the surge in interest by US-based car manufacturers to develop hydrogen cars in the 1990's, hydrogen has ever since been promoted as a substitute for gasoline and diesel (and to a lesser extent, for liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, and liquefied natural gas, LNG). As is the case for industrial end-users looking for a substitute to fossil-fuel combustion, hydrogen could be used in an internal combustion engine (ICE), although the vehicle would probably need to be adjusted to fze the hydrogen consumption. The other main applications for extracting energy from hydrogen are proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, considered mainly due to their higher efficiency (~50%) with respect to ICEs (~30%); the operation of PEM fuel cells has already been extensively covered in the literature. There are several kinds of mobility applications including LDVs (light-duty vehicles i.e., passenger cars), MDVs (medium-duty vehicles e.g., vans, public transport buses), and HDVs (heavy-duty vehicles like long-haul trucks and coaches).Regarding LDVs, fuel cell vehicles have existed in the market for longer than a decade, with Japanese and Korean car manufacturers being the most prominent in the market.

State-of-the-Art Ammonia Production: Capacity, Cost, LocationThe current Haber-Bosch process produces ammonia in a centralized manner. Haber-Bosch facilities are currently built in locations that have access to natural gas and are close to chemical industrial centers. The cost of ammonia production today is heavily influenced by the scale of production and the price of natural gas (Figure ). Smaller production scales result in higher production costs due to limited economies of scale, equipment costs, and labor costs that do not decrease proportionately with the scale. Ideally, Haber-Bosch facilities operate on production scales in the range of thousands of metric tons per day, enabling them to achieve production costs as low as 250 USD/t N H 3 when natural gas prices are low (∼ 2 USD/MMBtu). However, as production scales decrease (∼ 50 tpd), the production cost can increase by more than five times to 1,300 USD/t N H 3 . Moreover, even at large production scales, the production cost of ammonia is highly sensitive to natural gas prices. In early 2022, natural gas prices went from around 2 USD/MMBtu to over 40 Given the centralized nature of the Haber-Bosch process, there are fewer than a hundred production facilities worldwide. These facilities are predominantly located in rich countries that have access to inexpensive natural gas and advanced chemical infrastructure. The average distance between the Haber-Bosch facilities and farms is around 1,200  km. However, it is important to note that despite the presence of nearby Haber-Bosch facilities, certain regions in the world still struggle to meet their regional demand for ammonia.

MethodsReaction considered in this study is the isotope exchange reaction among H 2 and D 2 , with gold (Au) nanoparticles supported on silica particles as a catalyst, represented by the following equation:H 2 (g) + D 2 (g) ----2 HD(g)(1)The catalyst was prepared using wet chemical deposition and precipitation method followed by heat drying, as described in the literature. This resulted in formation of the catalyst in the form of a dry powder. Characterization was carried out using diffuse reflectance measurements where a strong plasmon absorption band was observed at 520 nm (see SI-1), confirming the presence of Au nanoparticles in size range of 10 to 20 nm. In a typical experiment, a loosely packed bed of catalyst was placed in the reaction chamber and purged with dry nitrogen for a few hours and subsequently, the reaction chamber was evacuated. Following this, H 2 and D 2 gases (both 99.99% pure) were filled in equal amounts with a total pressure of 1 bar. Reaction was carried out in a closed system (with intermittent sampling), either by heating the catalyst bed using a heater under dark conditions (thermal)or under light illumination of the catalyst bed (light-induced).A schematic diagram of our experimental setup is shown in figure (left panel). It consists of a custom-made stainless steel reaction chamber equipped with several gas inlets mbar (sampling off). For monitoring progress of the reaction, a small part of gas mixture (less than 1 %) from the reaction chamber was sent into sampling chamber via the solenoid valve. This valve was typically operated with a pulse duration of 100 microseconds (approx) at 30 Hz repetition rate for a duration about 60-100 sec. These settings ensured that there is a steady state build up of gas pressure in the

In contrast, the free energy differences (noted as ""PMF point"" approach in Figure ) show an opposite trend with the change of temperature, mainly due to the lack of two in-plane modes considered in free energy calculations. It is also found in Figure that, different to TST rates based on PMF barriers, the directly calculated rates from diffusion time of MD trajectories show an obvious non-Arrhenius property, which should be close to the practical motif of an elementary process in heterogeneous catalysis.

1.7 V must be applied to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the bottleneck of water splitting. Even the most efficient OER electrocatalysts to date show significant overpotentials (up to 0.4 V), which leads to a significant amount of energy being spent on producing oxygen, a product with low market value. As a result, the deployment of the green hydrogen production market is hindered: green hydrogen currently accounts for only 4% of the overall production worldwide, equivalent to 3.8 Mt in 2021. Interestingly, this is in line with the amount of electricity produced worldwide using solar PV, accounting for 3.6% (179 TWh in 2021). Therefore, boosting the largescale production of green hydrogen requires the parallel optimization and scale-up of both solar PV and electrolyzers. Value-added oxidation reactions are an attractive pathway to further reduce green hydrogen production costs by reducing energy consumption and adding market value. Biomass electrolysis offers a potential solution to replace the sluggish OER at the anodic side of (photo)electrolyzers with the more favorable organic molecule oxidation, which could lead to a more efficient production process. The hydrogen produced in this way is still considered ""green"" since biomass is recognized as a CO2-neutral, abundant, and renewable substitute for fossil fuels. Additionally, the rich proton content in most biomass building blocks makes it an effective H2 carrier. Compared to water electrolysis, the electrolysis of biomass feedstock to generate H2 requires less theoretical electricity consumption, as previously reported <ref type=""bibr""

Genetic algorithm performance initialized from previous model parametersWhile section 3.1 demonstrated the power of the genetic algorithm to optimize network Hamiltonian parameters from very weak initial guesses, here we show that, in some cases, the genetic algorithm also offers performance improvements by further refining previously parameterizations of network Hamiltonian models . In these applications, the zeroth generation was created by centering a randomly distributed point cloud in parameter space around parameters for each fibril topology, which were previously published by Grazioli et al . The results of these parameter evolutions, carried out on a 48 node system, are shown in Figure . The evolution of the 1,2 2-ribbon is highlighted, as it is both the amyloid fibril topology most commonly observed in nature , and it exhibited a substantial increase in fibril fraction as a result of applying our genetic algorithm. The distributions were generated by carrying out 200 simulations on the highest fibril fraction-producing parameter from each generation.  As a precaution to rule out the possibility that the genetic algorithm had converged on ideal parameters for smaller systems that might not scale to larger systems, the best generations from the 48 node evolutions for each of the 5 fibril types were then used as the first generation for an additional evolution squence carried out on a 256 node system. It should be noted, however, that scaling network Hamiltonian models to accommodate different system sizes can often be accomplished by simply scaling the edge paramter via a Krivitski offset .

to spectra acquired from CHO cells on soft and stiff functionalized PA gels on the commercial substrates from Thorlabs (Figure .a). The most obvious difference between the four spectra is the lower intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra of the cell on the soft PA gel attached to the custom substrate. Because this feature is absent in the spectra of the stiff PA gel on a custom substrate, it is not likely due to either the custom substrate itself or to differences in the reagents used to attach the photopolymerized and thermally polymerized gels to the custom substrate and commercial substrate, respectively. Instead, we attribute the low intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra acquired from the soft PA gel on the custom substrate to a low degree of polymerization within this gel. This interpretation is supported by our observation that the intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 increases with the UV exposure time (Figure .b), and prior reports that assign the spectral peaks at 830-850 cm -1 to polyacrylamide .Comparison of the average spectra acquired from cells on each combination of PA gel stiffness and substrate (Figure .b) reveals the spectra acquired from both the custom substrate and the commercially available (Thorlabs) substrate are roughly comparable. However, the average spectra from CHO cells on the custom substrate have higher standard deviation.Because photopolymerization produces gels with a larger range of stiffness than thermal polymerization, this higher variance is due to the use of photopolymerization to create the PA gels on the custom substrates and thermal polymerization to create the PA gels on the substrates purchased from Thorlabs.

charges polarize in response to their chemical environment (for example, the presence of electron donating or withdrawing groups). Bespoke charges are usually assumed to be compatible with the fixed Lennard-Jones parameters of the force field, although these themselves have also been shown to be dependent on the local environment of the atom. Although proteins must also experience polarization effects in both the charges and Lennard-Jones parameters, protein force field parameters have always, to date, been assigned from a transferable library. This leads to an inconsistency in the parametrization strategy used for protein force fields and bespoke small molecule force fields. This is potentially problematic when studying properties that depend on the electrostatic potentials of proteins, such as their interactions with small molecules, and there is no clear way around this using traditional force field fitting methods.To improve the consistency between charge and Lennard-Jones parameters, and also reduce the reliance on fitting to experimental data, one could either directly fit non-bonded MM parameters to reproduce quantum mechanical (QM) energies and forces, or derive the non-bonded parameters of the force field directly from QM. In the latter approach, the QM interaction energy may be broken down into physically motivated components using intermolecular perturbation theory, though these methods are limited to quite small system sizes.

I. INTRODUCTIONQuantum computing promises to deliver new technology for solving complex problems that are beyond the capability of conventional classical computers . Particularly exciting is the potential use of quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Electronic structure calculations provide fundamental information about matter and are essential for research in chemistry, physics, and material science. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of finding the exact solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation scales factorially with the system size, limiting predictive power of quantum chemistry. This unfavorable scaling arises because of the quantum entanglement of electronic degrees of freedom in many-body wavefunctions. Because the wavefunction is a quantum object, one may expect that it could be encoded on a quantum device more effectively than on classical devices 1 , however, the exact details of effective quantum algorithms for solving the electronic Schrödinger equation remain elusive.The main task of an electronic structure calculation is finding the eigenvalues of given molecular Hamiltonian (i.e., electronic energies). One practical quantum algorithm for molecular simulations is called the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm . QPE-a quantum algorithm for evaluating eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator Ĥ-was expected to lead to an exponential speed-up of quantum simulation relative to classical algorithms. However, a disturbing feature of QPE is the large number of quantum operations that are needed to achieve the target precision: O(p -1 ) successive operations of e i Ĥt are needed for precision p.

However, the energy difference between 1 and 2 was not significant enough to ensure exclusive formation of the latter, thus reinforcing the results illustrated in Scheme 4. DFT calculations revealed that ""ring-walking"" of 1 en route to 2 might occur via 1,2-hydride shift via an energetically-favorable transition state TS1 (26.9 kcal•mol -1 ) in which C-H bond-cleavage is enabled by formation of a Ni-H bond. Interestingly, the shifting hydrogen atom is shared by the two Ni centers at unsymmetrical distances of 1.5 and 1.9 Å and by the C2 carbon atom (1.6 Å). An otherwise similar TS2 was located by starting with 2 as precursor instead with an activation barrier of 22.9 kcal•mol -1 . Putting these results into perspective, the 1,2-hydride shift might not occur directly from carbon to carbon, but rather in a two-step process via the intermediacy of Int-1 possessing a µ-hydride bridge between the two Ni centers. Unfortunately, all our attempts at either isolating Int-1 or detect the formation of the highly shielded bridging µ-hydride by NMR spectroscopy were unsuccessful, suggesting that these species might not be particularly stable in solution. This notion gains credence by the kinetically instability found for Int-1, possessing a higher energy when compared to both 1 and 2 (>17.0 kcal•mol -1 ), thus precluding its isolation or detection by conventional analytical techniques. The results compiled in Schemes 4 and 5 suggest that a nickel translocation throughout the arene backbone might hold promise to establish a new rationale for enabling C-C bond formations of aryl pivalates at remote C(sp 2 )-H sites.

For the input structure, the run time t of the biased MD is determined automatically from a covalent and non-covalent flexibility measure (see Sec. 4.4 and the Supporting Information). To create an initial structural ensemble, 24 metadynamics (MTD) simulations are conducted with several different bias parameters as in the default CREST runtype. The structural ensemble obtained from this step is later used as the reference to calculate S conf (0) (see Eq. 15). Structures are sorted according to their relative energy, structural Cartesian RMSD, and rotational constants to distinguish between unique conformers and degenerate rotamers, as described in Ref.56. conf , an extrapolation as described in Sec. 3.1 is conducted.

Green hydrogenGreen hydrogen is produced by using water and sunlight (or renewable-driven electricity). There are mainly three types of solar-driven water electrolysis processes: photocatalytic (PC) water splitting, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, and photovoltaics (PV) combined with electrolysis. Among the above three approaches, PV-driven water splitting already reaches relatively high TRLs (TRL 7), with recently demonstrated solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies up to about 20%. Higher efficiencies are foreseen in the near future using tandem solar cells based on improved hybrid organicinorganic perovskite light absorbers. Recently, the certified solar to electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) tandems of lead halide perovskite with silicon has reached 32.5 %, a value previously achieved only by expensive III/V semiconductors. Figure reports the AM0 and AM1.5 solar spectra, together with the portion of the spectrum accessible by a double junction, tandem perovskite/Si cell (see Figure caption for details). The integration of the AM1.5 spectrum up to the NIR cutoff (1107 nm) set by the Si bottom absorber returns an accessible photon flux of about 2.46 × 10 21 s -1 •m -2 . Given an PCE of 30%, the photon flux effectively converted into electricity (~7.38 × 10 20 s -1 •m -2 ) generates a current density of almost 120 A•m -2 , provided by the PV module to the electrolyzer (for this estimation, the PCE was considered equal to 30% for both absorbers in the tandem device).

It is higher from the electronic gap by one quantum of vibration and corresponds to the period of 4 fs. Consistent with this selectivity, the Lagrange multipliers for the pair are again negligible.

Another novelty of our approach is the extrapolation of S conf to the ensemble completeness as discussed in section 3.1. The corresponding procedure requires systematically and smoothly improving CE quality in each iteration. In practice, the required number of iterations is very molecule specific but convergence is typically achieved within 5-15 iterations (see Fig. for some examples). The entropy difference between the last iteration and the extrapolated value is often relatively small but very significant for very flexible systems with huge ensembles. For example the CE of n-octadecane contains over half a million conformers within 6 kcal mol -1 at the last iteration. In a more typical case the entropy gain due to the extrapolation is smaller than one entropy unit (1 cal mol -1 K -1 ). Apixaban and Tamiflu depicted in Fig. are such examples, but nonetheless exhibit different convergence behavior. For small molecules the extrapolation is mostly not necessary because the entire ensemble will be found during the initial sampling procedure. From another viewpoint, the extrapolation scheme might rather be seen as a technical supplement for reduction of stochastical noise between the iterations and consquently, an improved prediction the final S conf value. Note, that 3 cal mol -1 K -1""entropy units"" refer to the usual 1 kcal mol -1 chemical accuracy at room temperature.Thus, with an accuracy for S better than about 1-2 cal mol -1 K -1 , the electronic energies of the molecules from DFT or wave function theory (WFT) become the accuracy bottleneck in typical thermochemical calculations.

At both concentrations, a ground-state bleach (GSB) is observed at ∼650 nm, and a small amount of stimulated emission (SE) at ∼720 nm. For the the 0.05 mM TIPS-Pn solution (Fig. (a)), there are additional excited-state absorption (ESA) signals centered at approximately 453, 514, and 572 nm, which are consistent with previous observations of the absorption of the TIPS-Pn singlet exciton. The spectrum of the 0.05 mM TIPS-Pn solution appears to maintain its shape over time. Figure 1(b) shows the averaged spectrum over early times (50-150 ps), and late times (7500-8000 ps), normalized to the GSB. The shape is essentially identical for both time windows, suggesting that predominantly singlet excitons are present over the full 8 ns window, and there is insignificant triplet formation. The kinetics at all wavelengths fit well to a single exponential decay with a lifetime of 18.1 ± 0.2 ns (Fig. and Sec. S4.1 of the supplementary material). A small deviation is present at very early times (<50 ps), which we attribute to solvent reorganization. 17 Previously reported lifetimes of TIPS-Pn singlet excitons vary from around 12 to 22 ns, with this range of values likely due to the presence of additional deactivation pathways in some of these measurements through reactions with oxygen.

of the PorSils, single crystals of the four species that possessed aromatic silyl caps 1f-i were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. This data confirmed the presumed structures in all cases: in each of the four structures the hypercoordinate silicon core adopts an octahedral structure with the two silyloxy ligands observed in a trans (diaxial) arrangement (Figure ). The asymmetric unit in 1i contains two molecules, each in a different conformational pose (1i′ and 1i′′).Of the four compounds we examined (seen in Table ), all deviated from planarity. Compound 1g is the most planar molecule with two meso carbon atoms located trans to each other displaced above and below the plane by ±0.011 Å. This is the most planar porphyrin silane crystal structure reported to date. The meso carbons in 1h and in both poses of 1i were each out of plane, though only slightly (≤0.152 Å), and porphyrins maintained overall symmetry around the central silicon. Unique amongst the studied set, compound 1f displayed the least planar structure and was surprisingly devoid of symmetry around the central silicon atom. In general, we were gratified to see that modification of the easily incorporated axial silyloxy substituents can control the degree to which the porphyrin deviates from planarity in the crystal structure. This demonstrates that axial substitution is a powerful tool for control of solid-state porphyrin conformation.In terms of electronics, the iterative replacement of methyl for phenyl groups on the silyloxy cap (1f to 1g to 1i) should increase the electron density on the silane allowing for lengthening of the O1-Si2/O2-Si3 bond (Figure ); the excess electron density on the oxygen could translate to a shorter Si1-O distances and allow the Si-N bonds to lengthen to accommodate the preferred return to planarity of the ring. No such effect is observed.

to the optical band gaps of 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, as determined by UV/Vis, yielding a deviation between (experimental) optical and (calculated) electronic band gaps of 0.42 eV for azupyrene and 0.20 eV for pyrene.The deviation between the electronic and the optical gap for azupyrene is in fact even larger due to the symmetry selection rules at play. The HOMO→LUMO dipole transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and therefore the LUMO energy does not control the optical band gap. (It should be noted that the HOMO→LUMO transition might still be responsible for a very weak signal at about 1.8 eV as shown in Figure in the SI, which is neglected for the following calculations.) For pyrene, the HOMO→LUMO transition is allowed and determines the optical band gap. If the difference between the optical band gap and the electronic band gap is to be calculated in a meaningful manner using electronic ""frozen orbital"" transition energies, the LUMO has to be excluded for azupyrene. Accordingly, the DFT-calculated electronic band gap of azupyrene increases from 2.96 eV to 3.62 eV. With this value the difference between the DFT-based ""frozen orbital"" electronic band gap and the (experimental) optical band gap is 1.08 eV (= 3.62 eV -2.54 eV) for azupyrene, while the same difference is only 0.20 eV (= 3.83 eV -3.63 eV) for pyrene. The large deviation between the electronic and optical band gap for azupyrene is a direct consequence of its nonalternant -electron system. This topological property of azupyrene leads to a localization of the molecular orbitals. When an electron is excited into a higher lying orbital, then its initial and final orbitals can be located in different parts of the molecule, thus decreasing electron-electron repulsion in the excited state and lowering the transition energy. This explanation was already used to explain the color of the prototypical nonalternant molecule azulene.

Depending on the enzyme for the treatment the degradation products were dipeptides or tripeptides, all of which have no antibacterial activity (Fig ). ε-Poly-L-lysine as a FDA approved antibacterial food additive showed slightly better antibacterial activity than K18S4, but slower bacteria-killing (Fig ). Although ε-Poly-L-lysine was degradable by specific enzymes produced by few specific types of microorganisms , it was highly stable in the presence of many common enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, and maintained the original antibacterial activity after treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin (Fig ). Therefore, ε-Poly-L-lysine is not a suitable antibiotic substitute in aquaculture. After S. aureus was incubated with Dye-K18S4 and propidium iodide (PI, red fluorescence) for around 450s, a small amount of Dye-K18S4 began to accumulate in the cytoplasm without enrichment on the cell membrane beforehand (Fig ). At about 1260s, a burst of Dye-K18S4 and PI into the cytoplasm indicated critical damages on the cell membrane of S. aureus (Fig 4a ). The observed membrane damage was at the late stage of the bacteria-polymer interaction when S. aureus was killed by the peptide polymer. Since the Dye-K18S4 was not enriched on the cell membrane, the membrane damage may not be caused by Dye-K18S4 directly from the outside of the bacteria. Fluorescence intensity analysis across S. aureus cells, at 120s and 1500s after incubation, echoed above observation that Dye-K18S4 did not enrich either on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm at an early stage, but enriched inside the cell at a late stage (Figure <ref

target=""#b39"">39 Assuming all non-secular terms are negligible the strength of the dipolar coupling is given by 𝜔 BB = 𝜔 C (3 cos $ 𝜃 -1), where 𝜃 is the angle between the inter-spin vector and the external magnetic field and 𝜔 C is the coupling frequency when 𝜃 = 90°. While each orientation of the molecule is equally likely to be present in the sample, leading to a Pake pattern of inter-spin coupling frequencies, the orientations do not contribute equally to the recorded data due to the inherent orientation selectivity of microwave pulses (Figure ). As such we can generate two models of dipolar coupling: one with uniform weights representing the sample as a whole, and one in which each orientation is weighted by the overlap of the nitroxide spectrum with the microwave pulses. The simulated fidelities of the entangling gate with 𝜔 C = 2 MHz for the uniform and weighted models are 0.749 and 0.821, respectively, significantly lower than the corresponding simulations considering an isotropic interaction. This decrease in fidelity is caused by interference between systems with different coupling frequencies, which diminishes the expectation values of the anti-phase coherences. The uniformly weighted simulation is more impacted by this interference as its frequency distribution is a complete Pake pattern, whereas the frequency distribution of the spectrally weighted simulation corresponds to a partial Pake pattern.In addition to the orientational disorder, molecules in frozen solution will adopt different conformations with different inter-spin distances. As a result there will be a distribution in 𝜔 C which will further broaden the inter-spin coupling distribution. Here we take 𝜔 C to be normally distributed with mean 𝜇 + ' and standard deviation 𝜎 + ' . As expected, as 𝜎 + ' is increased the fidelity of both models decreases (Figure ).

and the displacement vector s lies tangent to the manifold at q, the point q + s will generally not lie on the manifold of physically allowed configurations.In practice, this problem is usually solved by finding the point x in Cartesian space which corresponds to the valid coordinate q that is closest to q + s in redundant internal coordinate space. This can be accomplished by iterating the Newton-Raphson root-finding algorithm until convergence,x k+1 = x k + J + k (q + s -q k ) ,(32)where q k and J k are the internal coordinate vector and internal-Cartesian Jacobian matrix corresponding to x k , respectively. While this approach is computationally facile and generally converges in only a few iterations, it does not account for the curvature of the space of valid internal coordinates, which results in poor quality displacements when using highly redundant coordinate systems, for example for molecules with rings. We have previously developed an alternate approach for realizing displacements in redundant internal coordinate systems based on geodesics of the curved internal coordinate manifold. This geodesic approach accounts for the correlation between internal coordinates not only at the endpoints of the displacement, but also throughout the entire displacement trajectory. We have shown that this geodesic displacement strategy dramatically reduces the number of steps required to reach convergence in a minimization algorithm as compared to the traditional Newton displacement method. Following each geometry optimization step, the approximate Hessian is updated using the geodesic secant update, which is also described in our previous work. As mentioned previously, the parameter α in equation 28 (for minimization) and equations 29 and 30 (for saddle point optimization) is chosen to satisfy a trust region condition. In our

For example, in CaCCSr excitation energy to 2 1 ∆ state is shifted by 0.079 eV relative to the excitation energy to 1 2 ∆ state in CaCCH (Table in SI).Inspection of the energy diagrams in Figure shows that the spectra of ACCB molecules corresponds to the sum of the ACCH and BCCH spectra with the presence of the ionic states.The effective number of entangled states for these transitions is smaller than in ACCA, reflecting an independence in the electronic excitation of each electron in ACCB (compare Z HE in Table and S5 in SI).  in SI.In conclusion, using EOM-DEA-CCSD approach we investigated the electronic structure of hypermetallic molecules with two alkaline earth metals separated by the acetylene linker-a promising platform for applications in QIS and precision measurements.

Network Hamiltonian simulations of amyloid fibril formationNetwork Hamiltonian models are a type of highly computationally efficient coarsegrained (CG) molecular simulation, which are capable of reproducing multiple known experimental observables (e.g. topological structures measured via NMR and fibril formation kinetics data from dye-binding fluorescence assays ), and can provide insight into the complex interactions between proteins that lead to the formation of amyloid fibrils. By sacrificing atomic-level details, these models can capture the essential interactions and dynamics that drive amyloid aggregation. This facilitates the discovery of assembly mechanisms and provides insight into the structure and stability of amyloid fibrils. In contrast to particle-based simulations, these simulations capture essential interactions and dynamics for non-covalent bond formation and breakage between aggregating proteins by direct dynamical modeling of graph structures. This approach of directly modeling network dynamics allows for exploration of timescales and larger system sizes many orders of magnitude larger than what is tractable using particle-based methods. Model parameterization is validated such that models are able to reliably reproduce experimentally measured mature fibril structures as an emergent phenomenon. Network Hamiltonian simulations can offer valuable insights into the thermodynamics, kinetics, and structural transitions involved in amyloid fibril assembly, which can aid in identifying targets for the design of potential therapeutic strategies; however, substantial technical challenges are inherent to parameter selection, as the parameter space is fraught with discontinuities and nonlinearities .

= 1 √ 2 (|1001⟩ -|0110⟩).(36)To construct a quantum circuit for this task, we utilize the Gray code decomposition , which allows one to connect two arbitrary qubit states by sequential bit flips. An example of the Gray code quantum circuit that generates the qubit state of Eq. ( ) is shown in Fig.1. The process of populating a desired quantum state starts with the transformation of the initial qubit state |0⟩ ⊗ n into N -particle subspace, where n and N correspond to the number of qubits and particles in the system of interest, respectively. Next, one designs unitary operators using the Gray code decomposition as shown in the example quantum circuit of particles with respect to the reference qubit state. The subsequent multi-qubit controlled-R y (θ i ) creates additional 1 particle to the state (completion of M hM p excitation) as well as introduces the parameters to the reference (cos θ i 2 ) and the target excited determinant (sin θ i 2 ). The Gray code for the single unitary operation is completed by the same 2M -1 multi-qubit controlled-NOT gates, but in the reversed order.

In addition, adjustable parameters are introduced to both reference |1100⟩ (cos θ i 2 ) and target configurations (sin θ i 2 ).

is a slight observable trend with time in the modeled data corresponding to an increase in T 1 absorption at 504 nm relative to the GSB. The difference between the shape of the experimental and modeled spectra (Fig. )), shows a negative trend as a function of time that is centered at 504 nm. This result confirms that the amount of T 1 predicted here using the upper bound for the ISC rate constant that we have determined is an overestimate, and thus the true ISC rate constant is lower than this value.The upper bound of k ISC for TIPS-Pn is greater than the pseudo-first-order SF rate constant (k SF [S 0 ]) up to a concentration of 1.45 mM, where k ISC and k SF [S 0 ] are equal. Based on the kinetic model and these rate constants, at 8 mM, ISC could account for up to 10% of triplets formed after 8 ns. So the assumption of negligible ISC made when fitting the bimolecular SF rate above is potentially invalid. We therefore refit the model with k ISC equal to 3.08 × 10 6 s -1 and found that for this level of ISC, k SF fits to lower range of (2.5 ± 0.6) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 (compared to (2.7 ± 0.6) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 for no ISC) (Table ). This analysis is shown in detail in Sec. S4.2.2 of the supplementary material. The fit to the deconvoluted TA data at both 0.05 mM and 8 mM using these rate constants is given in Fig. . We emphasize that this fit only uses an upper bound of ISC; the true ISC rate constant may be significantly lower. Considering the uncertainty in the ISC rate constant, the range of bimolecular SF rate constants becomes 1.9×10 9 M -1 s -1 (lower bound of T 1 concentration, upper bound of ISC) to 3.3×10 9 M -1 s -1 (upper bound of T 1 concentration, no ISC), or (2.6 ± 0.7) × 10 9 M -1 s -1 . Using the lower bound of this adjusted rate at 0.05 mM results in a revised 2.4 × 10 -10 M of T 1 formed due to SF, which is still substantially lower than

Photocatalysis is characterized by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that initiate oxidation reactions leading to the degradation of dye molecules. Several factors, including the molecular weight, dye structure, and unique characteristics of UiO-66-NDC, can impact the efficacy of dye removal. Optimal results were achieved with a catalyst concentration of 300 mg/L, as higher dosages led to reduced efficiency due to particle agglomeration and decreased light access to active sites.Higher initial dye concentrations also resulted in reduced removal rates due to increased competition for reactive radicals. The study highlighted the importance of understanding initial dye concentration for wastewater treatment.

Pure JUC-557-nanosheet showed low sensitivity for various anions (Supplementary Fig. ).

However, when F -ion was added into this system, the fluorescence of JUC-557-nanosheet with Fe 3+ was remarkably enhanced (up to 38%), which could be attributed to the formation of a stable coordination complex, FeF 6 3-. The quenched fluorescence of JUC-557-nanosheet with Fe 3+ could not be fully recovered because there may be a competitive equilibrium between the cyan group and F -with Fe 3+ . Interestingly, different from the detection of F -, the addition of I -resulted in an even more fluorescence decrease of JUC-557-nanosheet with Fe 3+ (as low as 6%) since I -can be oxidized to I 2 by Fe 3+ ions.Although partial Fe 3+ ions were consumed during the formation of I 2 , the decline of fluorescence of JUC-557-nanosheet with Fe 3+ was obvious, which may be because the nanosheet with Fe 3+ was more sensitive to the generated I 2 .

The H4FBCDC ligand reaches the maximum yield stress at 1.30 nN, which is higher compared to the H4BBCDC that demonstrates an inelastic transition at 1.02 nN. Furthermore, the Young's modulus, reflected by the linear slope of the stress-strain curve, is also larger for H4FBCDC.

IntroductionMolecular mechanics (MM) force fields for biomolecular simulations have been under continuous development for many years. In traditional transferable force fields, every atom in a molecule is assigned a type based on its atomic number, bonding and local chemical environment. The atom type then dictates the parameters that are used to model that atom's interactions. The force field parameters for each atom type are stored as a library, which is built by carefully reproducing the experimental or quantum mechanical properties of a benchmark set of small molecules. Due to the infeasibility of accurately parameterizing all of chemical space, a balance must be made between the size of the library and potential inaccuracy due to transferring parameters to molecules outside the fitting set. In many cases, it is acknowledged that transferable force fields are not sufficiently accurate. When building force fields for small molecules, the atomic charges are usually assigned in a system-specific or ""bespoke"" manner, using methods such as RESP, CM1, or AM1-BCC. This is because it is well-known that atomic charges polarize in response to their chemical environment (for example, the presence of electron

DiscussionIn this paper, we have introduced RamanSPy -a computational framework for integrative Raman spectroscopic data analysis. RamanSPy offers a comprehensive collection of tools for spectroscopic analysis designed to systematise the RS data analysis life cycle, reducing typical overheads of analysis workflows and improving methodological standardisation. The package also lays the foundations of a common repository of standardised methods, protocols and datasets, which users can readily access and exploit within the RamanSPy framework to conduct different benchmarking studies. Furthermore, RamanSPy is fully compatible with frameworks for data science and machine learning in Python, thereby facilitating the adoption and validation of advanced AI technologies for next-generation RS analysis. Lastly, we remark that, while our focus here has been on Raman spectroscopy, many of the tools in RamanSPy are of broad applicability to other vibrational spectroscopy techniques, including infrared (IR) spectroscopy.https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-m3xlm ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6114-5500 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

In the 31 P NMR spectra 6a and 6b show two doublets due to coupling with the two spin ½ silver isotopes ( 107 Ag and 109 Ag) at 99.3 ( 1 J109Ag,P = 862.3 Hz, 1 J107Ag,P = 746.4 Hz) and 94.3 ppm ( 1 J109Ag,P = 864.0 Hz, 1 J107Ag,P = 748.9 Hz), respectively. X-ray quality crystals were grown from saturated acetone solutions in air. 6a and 6b (Figure ) crystallize as centrosymmetric dimers in the monoclinic spacegroup P21/c with two molecules in the unit cell, and in the orthorhombic spacegroup Pbca with four molecules in the unit cell, respectively. The molecular structures show a µ-Cl bridged dimer with a deltoid Ag2Cl2 core coordinated by two ligands 1a or 1b, respectively.  Complexes with a (Ag-µ-Cl)2 core comprising a single phosphine ligand on Ag are rare and restricted to bulky monodentate phosphine ligands, such as P(NC 4H8NMe)3, 45 Ph2P(CH2)PPh2C(H)C(O)C6H4Cl, and the simple PcHex3. To further characterize the electronic character of bisaminoterphenylphosphine ligands DFT calculations were carried out to determine the theoretical TEP-value (TEPNi,theo) of bisaminoterphenylphosphines 1.

The timescales of long-time atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are typically reported in microseconds, while the timescales for experiments studying the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation are typically reported in minutes or hours. This timescale deficit of roughly 9 orders of magnitude presents a major challenge in the design of computer simulation methods for studying protein aggregation events. Thus, coarse-grained molecular simulations of amyloid fibril formation are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism behind the formation of these structures, which are implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Type II diabetes. Network Hamiltonian simulations of aggregation are centered around a Hamiltonian function that returns the total energy of a system of aggregating proteins, given the graph structure of the system as input. In the graph, or network, representation of the system, each protein molecule is represented as a node, and noncovalent bonds between proteins are represented as edges. The parameter, i.e. a set of coefficients that determine the degree to which each topological degree of freedom is favored or disfavored, must be determined for each network Hamiltonian model, and is a well-known technical challenge. Here, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) called a genetic algorithm is introduced for autonomously parameterizing network Hamiltonian models, whereby an initial set of randomly parameterized models, typically of low fibril yield (e.g. < 5 %), is used to initiate the evolution of subsequent model generations, ultimately leading to high fibril yield models (e.g. > 70 %). The methodology is also demonstrated by applying it to optimizing previously published network Hamiltonian models for the 5 key amyloid fibril topologies that have been reported in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and showing that the models generated by the AI produce fibril yields that surpass or

Only the last small fraction (<0.1%) are coordinations with a carboxylate terminal amino acid (Table ). Finally, most common metal-binding sites account with three coordinating amino acids on average (with an interquartile range of 2). On those grounds, BioMetAll works with default parameters that involved canonical amino acids side chains with a number of amino acids per metal-binding sites of three. The user can configure any other possible situation in a user-friendly manner.It is to notice that, besides standard amino acids, exogenous ligands (e.g. water or small molecules) can participate in the coordination of the metal. Although metrics for BioMetAll parameters have been obtained purely on amino acid geometric magnitudes, exogenous ligands could participate in the coordination of the metal on the analyzed set. The calculations we performed so far show that BioMetAll implicitly takes into account the changes in the metal position that those exogenous ligands could cause (as showed latter in the manuscript).

symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) calculations are performed in Psi4 29 version 1.3. The SAPT2+(CCD)δMP2 variant is applied with the 3-ζ augmented basis sets, following the recommendation of Parker et al. 30 The 5-ζ variants are used as density fitting bases. The r SE e structures based on B2PLYP corrections are used in this set of calculations. In the following text this method is simply called SAPT. The extrapolated WFT calculations are performed in Psi4 29 version 1.3rc1 and later. The extrapolation recipe consists of a Hartree-Fock component (HF/cc-pwcV[TQ5]Z), a MP2 component (MP2/cc-pwcV[Q5]Z), and a CCSD(T) correction to the MP2 correlation (∆CCSD(T)/cc-pwcV[TQ]Z]). All correlated levels of wavefunction theory are used with the frozen-core approximation, with density fitting used throughout. The weighted core-valence basis sets 31 of 3-, 4-, and 5-ζ quality are used here, with the appropriate effective core potentials for Kr, Xe, and Hg atoms. The default auxiliary basis sets for density fitting (up to def2-QZVPPD) are used throughout this work. The extrapolation is performed using the ""cubic"" Helgaker extrapolation formulas. 32 This extrapolation method is called MP2+δ(T) in the following text. Further corrections are applied to the MP2+δ(T) level of theory in the study of the Xe• • •OCS complex: The all-electron correlation, denoted δ AE FC , is estimated by the difference of CCSD(T)/TZP calculations with and without frozen core approximation.

We conducted the reaction between styrene 1a and reagent I in MeCN at room temperature under blue LED irradiation using cyanoarene 12 derivatives as organophotocatalyst instead of using the iridium-based photocatalyst employed by the Hopkinson and Glorius groups. To our delight, 2.5 mol% of PC1 (4CZIPN) furnished the desired vinyl-SCF3 product 2a in 50% yield (Table , entry 1). Encouraged by this first test, we evaluated other cynaoarene organophotocatalysts. The desired product was observed with PC2, PC3 and PC4 albeit with lower efficiency than with PC1 ). Afterwards, the use of other chloro and iodo ammonium salts also furnished desired product 2a but in only 30% yield (Table ). Using sodium bromide instead of tetra-butylammonium bromide afforded similar yield (Table ). Thus, due to its cost-effectiveness, NaBr was used for the rest of the optimisation. Then, the effect of solvent was studied. While DMF afforded desired product 2a in 40% (Table ), other solvents including toluene, ether, or DCM only provided marginal yields (Table , entries 9-11). Finally, increasing the photocatalyst loading to 5 mol% allows the formation of desired product 2a in an excellent 85% yield (Table , entries 12).

Linear alkanesComputational and accuracy limits of the presented approach are explored for the example of n-alkanes of increasing size, up to C 18 H 38 (see Fig. ). Such extremely large flexible systems have not been considered before quantitatively.The experimental entropy values show a strict linear increase with the number of carbon atoms and the reproduction of this relation represents a challenging task for theoretical methods. Both the RRHO as well as the msRRHO models increasingly underestimate the entropy with growing system size leading to a strongly non-linear behavior and errors of more than 20% for the largest alkanes considered. The major part of this difference can be accounted for by S conf . In fact, up to tetradecane (C 14 H 30 ), the computed values are all still within chemical accuracy of 3 cal mol -1 K -1 upon adding the conformational term.However, other effects start to come into play at this system size. The global minimum of C 14 H 30 and of smaller n-alkanes in the gas-phase always correspond to a linear (unfolded) structure. As intramolecular interactions, in particular London dispersion, become stronger with increasing system size, other conformers will be favored eventually. For C 14 H 30 up to C 18 H 38 , a competing folded conformer (in which dispersion interactions are maximized) is observed. The folded conformers are energetically similar to the respective linear structure but differ strongly in their msRRHO entropy. Depending on the applied theoretical level, either conformation could be the global gas-phase minimum, which makes the choice of S ref in Eq. 11 ambiguous and could introduce errors.

as in whole cell or crude cell lysate format (Fig. ). For CitB, a whole cell reaction platform was shown to affect benzylic C-H hydroxylation in an efficient manner. However, whole cell reactions were not effective for ClaD, leading us to perform reactions using filtered crude cell lysate. Both of these reaction platforms provide an operationally-simple method for preparing and using NHI biocatalysts in a manner that is amenable to preparative-scale reactions, avoiding arduous protein purification steps. Analytical-scale reactions revealed that CitB and ClaD each selectively hydroxylate compounds with a variety of steric and electronic properties (Fig. ). Introducing bulky, electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at either the C5 or C6 position did not prevent productive reactions with CitB. However, ClaD demonstrated limitations in its ability to accept larger groups, such as phenyl substituents at C5 and C6. The complementarity of substrate scopes between CitB and ClaD is also observed in the substitution at C4. For CitB, the formyl group at C4 can be substituted with alternative electronwithdrawing substituents such as a nitro group (25) or imine (24). However, substrates with greater steric bulk at C4, such as ketone substrates, were generally not hydroxylated by CitB. In contrast, ClaD can productively react with a variety of ketones (see 9, 27-30). The importance of this C4 substituent is also highlighted by the lack of reaction observed with 2,5-dimethylresorcinol (23). Based on preliminary analysis of models of these biocatalysts, we anticipate that a hydrogen bond acceptor is critical at the C4 position to achieve a catalytically active conformation of the substrate-enzyme complex.

For the high capital cost scenario, the optimal production and distribution network results in 92 regional production facilities with an average distribution distance of 1,200 km and an average regional production capacity of 10,500 metric tons of ammonia per day.A high discount rate, here considered to be 10%, results in an average ammonia cost of 680 USD/t N H 3 for the low capital cost scenario and 1,230 USD/t N H 3 for the high capital cost scenario (Figure ). The optimal ammonia production and distribution network consists of 241 regional production facilities (Figure ) with an average distribution distance of 660 km (Figure ) and an average regional production capacity of 4,000 metric tons of ammonia per day (Figure ) for the low capital cost scenario. For the high capital cost scenario, the optimal production and distribution network results in 75 regional production facilities with an average distribution distance of 1,400 km and an average regional production capacity of 13,000 metric tons of ammonia per day. Therefore, the selected discount rate is an important parameter in shaping strategies for decarbonizing and decentralizing ammonia production. On that account, it is essential for governments and entities to provide funding programs for building renewable ammonia production infrastructure.

As for VCl 3 (ddpd) (A, see Section 2.1), the potentials are parametrized at the CASSCF level of theory and corrected by using the CASPT2 vertical excitation energies in place of the CASSCF ones. For the newly designed complexes as well as for VCl 3 (ddpd), SH/LVC simulations of an ensemble of 200 trajectories were first propagated for a simulation time of 20 ps. For the complexes, that still exhibited larger singlet population, the simulation time was extended to 100 ps.

The diabatic states are states characterized by fixed electronic configurations, for which, in the present analysis, we use the electronic states at the triplet minimum geometry of each complex. In order to propose a kinetic model to explain the time evolution of the diabatic electronic state populations, we analyzed the individual pathways of a set of 100 trajectories through the different electronic states for each complex, see Section S5.

An examination of representative line plots of fluorescent profiles from each image showed clear peaks separated by ~100 nm in the post-LExM image, in contrast to peaks ~300 nm width in the pre-LExM image. Similar increases in resolution were seen in post-LExM images of labeled PC with markers of the Golgi complex and mitochondria (Figures ), with the latter enabling specific visualization of the outer mitochondrial membrane compared to other associated membranes containing tagged PC.

These compounds, mainly perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanoic sulfonic acid (PFOS), are common in industry as synthetic surfactants for the synthesis of polymer materials used in carpeting, upholstery, apparel, floor wax, textiles, firefighting foams, and sealants. Despite their ubiquity, PFAS have shown to be extremely persistent in the environment. Their slow degradability has led to an overwhelming abundance in the soil, dust, air, and groundwater.Unfortunately, these compounds have also been identified as carcinogens, among many other health effects, making them a global health threat. The detection and efficient removal of PFAS has thus become an important topic in recent years as these ""forever chemicals"" continue to be found in daily-use products and drinking water sources. These environmental factors coupled with the unique physical and chemical properties of PFAS require novel materials and sensing platforms for rapid and sensitive detection of these pernicious compounds.The typical strategy for sensitively detecting chemicals is to use high surface-area materials. In this context, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive materials family as they provide a rich library of systems with high surface area, intrinsic porosity, and high molecular adsorptivity.

IntroductionPhotoredox catalysis has emerged in the last decade as an important approach to perform new organic transformations. These reactions include cyclizations, cross couplings, amine and olefin functionalizations and are routinely used in the synthesis of pharmacophores and drug-like molecules. Typically, photoredox catalysis is driven by either energy transfer (EnT) or photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the photocatalyst and a quencher which forms a reactive radical or ionic species that initiates the desired reactivity. The mechanism for PET occurs in one of two ways: (i) Reductive quenching, whereby the photocatalyst is quenched through acceptance of an electron from a reductant, or (ii) oxidative quenching, whereby the photocatalyst donates an electron to an oxidant (Figure ). The quenching agent may be an integrated component of the transformation, such as one of the organic substrates or a co-catalyst, or a sacrificial quencher that serves to convert the photocatalyst to a species that can oxidize or reduce the organic substrate, such as O2 or alkyl amines. Shedding light on quenching steps within a photoredox reaction is crucial to gain mechanistic insights <ref type=""bibr""

Hydrogen storageAn important component of the supply chains of fossil fuels is the storage facilities. This is particularly relevant for gaseous fuels such as natural gas, where large-scale storage requires large volumes that can only be found underground. Storage of energy carriers is vital to the social acceptance, immediate implementation, and economy inclusion. It is also the primary method of coping with the fluctuations in supply and demand. One of the causes of the spike in the natural gas price at the end of 2021 was indeed the depletion of the European gas reservoirs that were put under stress by the decreased natural gas supply from abroad, namely Russia.Underground storage of hydrogen can be done in a similar fashion as the underground storage of natural gas i.e., in salt caverns. Salt caverns are synthetic subsurface structures that are developed by 'washing' away salt from an underground salt deposit until a hollow structure is formed. Salt caverns offer the most promising underground storage option due to the large sealing capacity of rock salt, its inert nature, as well as their flexibility toward injection/withdrawal cycles. Although salt deposits are not commonplaces in the world, they are not particularly rare, either: there is a significant amount of salt deposits spread throughout Europe (Figure ). It is estimated that the total on-and off-shore European hydrogen storage potential is 84.8 PWhH2, which represents more than 8 times of the total final energy consumption in Europe in 2020. This reinforces the potential to store significant amounts of H2 in Europe, enough to cover a potential surge in demand in the coming decades.The investigation of underground

While Figure only depicts the poly(G-C) strands for brevity, we observed similar geometric trends in poly(A-T) in which only LDA and B3LYP-D gave stable structures. Our results also corroborate previous molecular dynamics simulations on a DNA dodecamer, which suggested that the double-helical structure is not stable when dispersion interactions are not incorporated. 58

fitted exponential population curves; they are shown as thick lines in Figure . As the fitted lines follow the calculated populations closely, the proposed reaction networks are sufficient to describe the excited-state dynamics, despite some trajectories exhibiting more complex decay processes (see Section S5). The time constants from the exponential fits are reported in Section S6, which also includes a more detailed discussion on how the mechanisms were established.The mechanism of the excited-state dynamics of VCl 3 (ddpd) has been discussed in Section 2.1. In short, intersystem crossing from the 3 T 1 ' states (dark blue line) populates singlet states (violet line) which reach a maximum population of 43% at ca. 4 ps. Afterwards, the singlet population falls again due to intersystem crossing to the 3 T 2 states (green line) from where the population relaxes to the 3 T 1 ground states (red line). Not all population leaves the singlet states, however, as we find a singlet population of ca. 9% after 100 ps that can be available for phosphorescence. Similar to VCl 3 (ddpd), we find pronounced intersystem crossing that populates the singlet states in all four newly designed complexes. During the simulations each singlet population reaches at least 41%, the largest one being 54% in the case of [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, see Figure . All singlet population maxima are found within the first 5 ps simulation times. At later simulation times all singlet populations drop to lower values, however, leading to two different outcomes among the four complexes.For [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and VCl 3 (im-im-im), the singlet population drops to values around 1% already on a 20 ps time scale, making them less promising candidates for 3d-luminophores. In contrast, for [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -and VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), we find long-lived singlet populations for the full

current densities of about 20 mA cm -2 with minimal overvoltage losses, i.e. less than 0.3 V for extended periods of time (months or years), using cheap and earthabundant elements. The water electrolyzer therefore represents the under-developed component of this approach. Figure 2. AM0 and AM1.5 solar spectra, together with the portion of the spectrum accessible by a double junction tandem perovskite/Si solar cell. In this example, the hybrid organic/inorganic perovskite is the wide-bandgap top absorber, with a bandgap of 1.68 eV (cutoff at ~ 740 nm). Single crystalline, n-type silicon is the narrow-bandgap bottom absorber, with a bandgap of 1.12 eV at room temperature (cutoff at around 1107 nm). AM: Air Mass; UV: Ultraviolet radiation; VIS: Visible radiation; NIR: Near-infrared radiation; SWIR: short wavelength infrared radiation.Catalytic water splitting using photons or electricity occurs in a single step, as equation 3 shows. H2 +1/2 O2 → H2O (3) Water electrolysis processes have been extensively studied and reviewed in recent years, hence a vast amount of literature reviewing the processes already exists. Here we will only highlight the common production methods of green hydrogen, that differ in the type of charge carrier that completes the electric circuit of the electrolytic cell (Figure ):• Alkaline electrolysisthe charge carrier is -OH. This is the most common process for producing high-purity hydrogen for uses such as in the food industry (e.g., in the hydrogenation of triglycerides and fatty acids for human consumption) as well as in

of cross-catalysis: the initial exponential growth of the product followed by a reduction in rate as the fragment pieces are consumed. At 30 °C, the optimal temperature for this 18mer sequence, the DNA-I (14 nM) initiated reaction consumed all the limiting fragments within 45 minutes at these fragments and enzyme concentrations of 1.4-2.8 µM and 2.3 µM, respectively. Moreover, as shown in our earlier work, we have also observed a background-triggered process where exponential amplification occurred without the presence of an initial template (DNA-I) (open circles, Figure ). This process is attributed to a pseudo-blunt end ligation of the four fragments in the absence of any DNA-I templates. This ligation is not a true blunt end ligation, performed facilely by T4 DNA ligase, as the duplex that results from hybridization of Ia and IIaP has a 5'-phosphate abasic nucleotide, which should not interact with the 5'-phosphate deoxyadenosine single-base overhang from the IbP:Iib fragment duplex, hence our use of the term pseudo-blunt end. We have observed that T4 DNA ligase triggers this background process in all of the sequences that we have successfully amplified by LIDA suggesting that the enzyme is also effective at ligating either at or across from abasic single-nucleotide overhangs. First, we focused on identifying the kinetics of this background ligation reaction to allow us to more accurately incorporate the background triggered process into our kinetic model. The efficient ligation of 5'-phosphate abasic strands by T4 DNA ligase in templated ligations has long been known, but to the best of our knowledge, the ligation behavior of a 5'-single
