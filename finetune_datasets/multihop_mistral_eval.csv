596,The ligase can ligate the ternary complex to generate the product duplex.,"The step before spontaneous dissociation of the structure that exhibits much stronger binding affinities with thymidine at 30 ¬∞C compared to the abasic group in the LIDA process is the ligation of the ternary complex to generate the product duplex.

Explanation:
The LIDA process involves two coupled cycles initiated by the introduction of a target template (DNA-I) in the presence of an excess of four fragments, two of which (Ia and IbP) constitute the target sequence after their ligation. In the first step, the DNA-I hybridizes with one of two complementary fragments; the hybridization of the 5'-phosphate abasic containing fragment IIaP to the DNA-I is shown in the scheme in Figure . Next, the other fragment IIb hybridizes forming a ternary complex. The T4 DNA ligase present in the solution can ligate the ternary complex to generate the product duplex. Upon spontaneous dissociation of this product duplex, the newly synthesized DNA-II is liberated, which can template the formation of DNA-I through similar steps (Cycle II, Figure ). Thermodynamic parameters showed that the product duplex with thymidine exhibited much stronger binding affinities at 30 ¬∞C than that with the abasic group (1.98 x 10 12 M -1 vs 1.03 x 10 8 M -1 , respectively). Although the effective Kprod (with enzyme) is slightly lower than the K of the product duplex from ITC, we believe that this <4-fold difference is not significant, and that the stability of the product duplex is essentially unaffected by the presence or absence of ligase.",T4 DNA ligase ligates the ternary complex.,0.4210526315789474,0.0,0.17391304347826086,0.0,0.5016339869281046,0.7843426603252455,0.04562737642585551,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.1808739255014327,0.28876160728191047
