1638,"Steam methane reforming is the leading process for producing grey hydrogen because it is the cheapest at the industrial scale, despite its high environmental impact, which results in every kg of H2 produced generating around 8 kg of CO2.","Steam methane reforming (SMR) is the leading process to produce grey hydrogen. In 2021, the global hydrogen demand reached a peak of 94 Mt. Currently, about 48% of the hydrogen produced worldwide (~45 Mt in 2021) comes from SMR. This process consists of dehydrogenating methane (commonly from a natural gas stream) to produce a hydrogen-rich mixture, and it is the cheapest at the industrial scale. However, its environmental impact is very high: every kg of H2 produced in this way generates around 8 kg of CO2, indirectly. Oil and coal gasification are still heavily used, accounting for the 30% (~28 Mt) and 18% (~17 Mt) of the world's hydrogen production in 2021, respectively. Typically, grey hydrogen production processes include additional steps (e.g., water-gas shift and acid gas removal) to maximize the hydrogen yield and separate the carbon oxides from the hydrogen stream.Among the traditional methods of producing grey hydrogen (reforming and partial oxidation), autothermal reforming (ATR) is used in less proportion. ATR which consists of the reforming of light alkanes (typically methane) with steam and air or oxygen is a process that combines the advantages of both SMR and partial oxidation. In fact, ATR is a combination of the two processes, and it is a more efficient process than SMR. However, the high cost of the catalysts and the high temperature required for the process make ATR less attractive than SMR.","Steam methane reforming is the leading process to produce grey hydrogen because it is the cheapest at the industrial scale.

1820,The acoustic activity of the anode is higher than that of the cathode.,"The acoustic activity of the anode is higher than that of the cathode when the current density is increased above 200-300 mA cm-2.

Explanation:
The acoustic activity of the anode is higher than that of the cathode when the current density is increased above 200-300 mA cm-2. This is because the anode is the site of oxygen evolution, which is a highly exothermic reaction that produces a large amount of heat. This heat can cause the anode to expand and contract, which can produce acoustic waves. The cathode, on the other hand, is the site of hydrogen evolution, which is a less exothermic reaction that produces less heat. This means that the cathode does not expand and contract as much as the anode, and therefore produces fewer acoustic waves.",The acoustic activity of both the anode and cathode increases similarly when the current density is increased above 200-300 mA cm-2.,0.3888888888888889,0.0,0.18888888888888888,0.11759824018615346,0.39080188679245287,0.17686390690944526,0.24358974358974358,0.0,0.10553633217993079,0.10246227202811363,0.4641544117647059,0.23896619786066498

2247,The B3LYP functional closely matches the CCSD(T) results for van-der-Waals stacked monomers.,"The B3LYP functional gives weaker binding energies than the CCSD(T) benchmarks, and prior work by Zhang et al. suggested that this under-binding becomes more pronounced with increasing molecular size. As such, B3LYP will incur significant errors for the large periodic strands, as we demonstrate in the next section. Based on these benchmark calculations, the B3LYP-D functional most closely matches the CCSD(T) results, particularly for the van-der-Waalsstacked monomers. In contrast, both the BLYP and B3LYP functionals produce geometries that are highly distorted in which the individual Watson-Crick base pairs are not even aligned in the same plane. A frequency analysis can give further information on structural stability; however, geometry optimizations of these large, periodic systems were already computationally expensive (requiring hundreds of thousands of CPU hours), and frequency calculations were out of reach for these structures. For this reason, we only present the structures in Figure , which clearly depict the base pairs to be misaligned with each other to depict the distortions/instabilities in these structures. The structural deformations in these periodic strands are fully consistent with the benchmark calculations described in the previous section. In particular, our benchmark calculations on individual nucleotides showed that only LDA and B3LYP-D predict stable A-T and C-G stacks/Watson-Crick pairs in comparison to the CCSD(T) benchmarks.

This work can easily be explored and expanded in the future by the next generations of students thus providing an interesting piece of research using transgenerationnal collaborations driving curiosity. 4 Materials and Methods Dissolving azophloxine (AP, 250 ¬µM) and copper sulfate (CuSO 4 , 250 ¬µM) in 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, 10 mM, pH=7.4) affords [Cu(AP)] (250 ¬µM), which is water-soluble and orange at working micromolar concentrations (see Figures and).Screening of various pHs from 5 to 8 allowed us to conclude that the best naked-eye discrimination between AP and [Cu(AP)]is obtained at pH=7.4. We therefore selected pH = 7.4 for the continuation of our study.Next, we hypothesized that the [Cu(AP)] complex could be used to assemble a receptor for phosphate derivatives, exploiting metal-ligand interactions for selective target recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this mononuclear complex has never been described before in the literature as a selective chemosensor for anions, especially phosphate derivatives.In this case, the displacement of the receptor-bound AP by anions could be visually observed with the naked eye (see Figure ).

1438,"Understanding how metallic moieties interact with biological systems is considered crucial because metallic moieties play a fundamental role in living organisms, including transition ones, and their impacts on molecular and cellular processes are countless.","Metal ions, including transition ones, play a fundamental role in living organisms. Present in about 30% of the known genome, their impacts on molecular and cellular processes are countless. Since biometallic complementarities sustain many mechanisms in living systems, they are essential for their adaptation to the environment and key to their health. Understanding how metallic moieties interact with biological systems is not just a health-related question. It is also a source of inspiration for the development of new synthetic routes, including environmentally friendly ones. As such, chemists have long intended to mimic biometallic synergies for industrial purposes. In the form of small amenable chemical systems (biomimetics) or complex de novo enzymes, a substantial part of chemical efforts focuses on reproducing or even extending Nature's bioinorganic repertoire.The specific problem of predicting where and how metallic moieties bind to proteins is of crucial importance in numerous areas of chemistry and its closest interfaces. After decades, researchers in bioinorganics still intensively work on decoding the exact weight of the different molecular variables that are involved in the construction of biometallic edifices (charges of the metal ions and their amino acid environment versus electric field of the entire protein, redox properties of the metal, etc.). In silico approaches offer an excellent option to get a better insight into metal-protein interactions and help in establishing predictive patterns. To date, though, only a limited ensemble of computational tools is available. Those methods are either based on sequence or structural analyses. On one side, computational predictors of metal binding sites are based on sequence analyses. They are based on the assumption that the amino acid composition of the protein sequence is a good predictor of the metal binding sites. On the other side, computational predictors of metal binding sites are based on structural analyses. They are based on the assumption that the protein structure is a good predictor of the metal binding sites.","Understanding how metallic moieties interact with biological systems is crucial because it not only addresses health-related questions but also inspires the development of new synthetic routes, including environmentally friendly ones.

2774,An electron releasing substituent,"1. Electron releasing substituent (ERS)
2. Electron withdrawing substituent (EWS)
3. Electron donating substituent (EDS)
4. Electron accepting substituent (EAS)

Correct Answer:

1. Electron releasing substituent (ERS)

Explanation:

The substituent ends up on a trans or a cis double bond in the product diene depending on its electronic nature in a process termed torquoselectivity. Overall, (a) an electron releasing substituent (ERS) is demonstrated to rotate outward to allow it reside on a trans double bond as in the transformation 1‚Üí2 and (b) an electron withdrawing substituent rotates inward to allow it reside on a cis double bond as in the transformation 3‚Üí4 as shown in Figure . During the investigation of torquoselectivity of ring opening from the differential transition state energies, Houk predicted inward rotation of the formyl (CHO) and nitroso (NO) groups and outward rotation of the nitro (NO2) group. Houk asserted that NO2 was a relatively poor resonance acceptor from a comparison of the Taft ÔÅ≥R o values. That NO2 was a poorer resonance acceptor than NO and CHO caught our attention for our own recent interest in torquoselectivity. We felt the contrary and, thus, chose to investigate. The relative resonance accepting ability of NO2, NO and CHO has not been systematically investigated till date. It is important to note that while 3-CHO-cyclobutene opens exclusively inward, the experimental selectivities of 3-NO-and 3-NO2-cyclobutenes are not reported. Figure .
