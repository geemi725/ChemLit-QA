1127,"The enzyme raises the stability of the nicked duplex, thereby helping to overcome product inhibition.","The enzyme compensates for the stability gaps between the intermediate complex and the product duplex by raising the stability of the nicked duplex, thereby helping to overcome product inhibition. In support of this observation, Lohman and coworkers' recently revealed that T4 DNA ligase bound more strongly to a nicked duplex over a duplex (Knet,nick = 2.5 -3.3 x 108 M-1 and Knet,duplex = 2.8 -7.25 x 106 M-1, respectively). This difference in magnitude of 102 in the enzyme binding affinity can help explain how the KA, prod/KA, inter ratio in the absence of the enzyme shrank from 103 -104 to 102 in the presence of the enzyme. The KA from the kinetic model contains contributions from both the intrinsic binding affinity of the DNA and the binding affinity of the enzyme for the complexes, so both of these effective Kprod and Kinter values are expected to increase in the presence of the enzyme. The change in Kinter is consistent with a higher binding constant for the intermediate complex in the presence of enzyme. Although the effective Kprod (with enzyme) is slightly lower than the K of the product duplex from ITC, we believe that this <4-fold difference is not significant, and that the stability of the product duplex is essentially unaffected by the presence or absence of ligase.","The enzyme compensates for the stability gaps by primarily raising the stability of the nicked duplex, which helps to overcome product inhibition.",0.6486486486486486,0.0,0.43333333333333335,0.3973436713737475,0.6813304721030042,0.8340869292114184,0.1532258064516129,0.0,0.0646817248459959,0.06288583714311466,0.24017467248908297,0.506433555100556
3377,A large number of qubits and gate operations,"The existing quantum algorithms for excited states often require a large number of qubits and gate operations, which precludes their application to larger systems. This is because the excited states often have more complex wavefunctions (open-shell, multi-configurational) even when the corresponding ground states are well behaved. Furthermore, in contrast to the ground state (which is unique in the sense that it is the lowest-energy state), there are many excited states, so the quantum algorithms should be capable of targeting a specific state (or states)e.g., the lowest energy states or states in a particular energy range, states of a particular symmetry/spin, states of a particular character, etc.

The complexity of this problem increases with the size and flexibility of the system, and the challenge becomes especially difficult in the rational design of open-shell transition-metal complexes where many electronic states and nuclear degrees of freedom participate in the excited-state dynamics. The only alternative is then to screen larger numbers of compounds as is done in the present work using computer simulations for a class of near-infrared emitting vanadium(III) complexes. Starting from the mechanism of the known emitter VCl 3 (ddpd) (ddpd = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-dipyridine-2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine), we establish design principles including an increase in the ligand-field strength in the complex in order to achieve higher emission quantum yields. Based on these principles, we design a large set of complexes that are tested for larger ligand-field splitting in static quantum chemistry calculations. For the subset of complexes with increased ligand-field splitting, we then perform nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and identify two promising near-infrared emitter with potential similar or increased emission quantum yield compared to the VCl 3 (ddpd) reference. An analysis of the mechanisms of all studied complexes reveals individual relaxation pathways for each compound, confirming the difficulty of the identifying useful rational design principles in these photoactive open-shell transition-metal complexes.","The design of photoactive compounds is considered challenging due to the complicated nature of the photodynamics that can arise.

1132,Reducing the rate constant k-2 to 0.1 x k-2 results in no self-replication because the rate of dissociation of the template:product is too slow for the system to self-replicate.,"The rate constant k-2 is the rate of dissociation of the template:product complex. When k-2 is reduced to 0.1 x k-2, there is no self-replication observed (Figure ). These results suggested that product inhibition is important as the rate of dissociation of the template:product strongly influences the success of the self-replication. Yet the overall stability of the intermediate complex also plays a significant role, which had until now been overlooked. In addition, simulations were conducted with 5 x kcat and 0.2 kcat to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the rate of ligation. When the kcat is 5 times faster than the value determined from our best fit of the data, the self-replication was much faster than what we observed. Conversely, the ligation rate was much slower when kcat was reduced by a factor of (0.2 x kcat), resulting in slow amplification of the templates (Figure ). These simulations are consistent with previous work that showed a strong dependence of replication on the magnitude of kcat of ligation. These simulations reveal two important take-home messages for developers of nonenzymatic self-replicating systems: they should focus on ways to stabilize the intermediate complex as well as ways to destabilize the product duplex and select rapid ligation strategies. Regarding the latter, very little product was observed within the first 7200 seconds (2 hours) of reaction when kcat was reduced to 0.1kcat (simulation not shown).Next, to provide some insight as to how the presence of the abasic affected the interactions with the enzyme, we determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat and Km for the ligation reaction in Cycle I for the system with and without the abasic group. The previous report on the affinity of T4 DNA ligase for nicked versus complete duplexes did not contain abasic groups. This previous work indicated that nicked ligation by T4 DNA ligase","Reducing the rate constant k-2 to 0.1 x k-2 results in no self-replication because product inhibition is significant, as the rate of dissociation of the template:product strongly influences the success of the self-replication process.",0.7466666666666666,0.0,0.5684931506849316,0.5573921457000568,0.6149732620320855,0.7765970035387137,0.1894150417827298,0.0,0.06942392909896603,0.0660171731836223,0.29309581041930133,0.35220510565237534

Present in about 30% of the known genome, their impacts on molecular and cellular processes are countless. Since biometallic complementarities sustain many mechanisms in living systems, they are essential for their adaptation to the environment and key to their health. Understanding how metallic moieties interact with biological systems is not just a health-related question. It is also a source of inspiration for the development of new synthetic routes, including environmentally friendly ones. As such, chemists have long intended to mimic biometallic synergies for industrial purposes.

955,Network Hamiltonian models are effective in simulating amyloid fibril formation because they sacrifice atomic-level details to capture the essential interactions and dynamics that drive amyloid aggregation. This facilitates the discovery of assembly mechanisms and provides insight into the structure and stability of amyloid fibrils.,"Network Hamiltonian models are effective in simulating amyloid fibril formation because they are able to capture the essential interactions and dynamics that drive amyloid aggregation. These models are able to reproduce multiple known experimental observables, such as topological structures measured via NMR and fibril formation kinetics data from dye-binding fluorescence assays. They can provide insight into the complex interactions between proteins that lead to the formation of amyloid fibrils. By sacrificing atomic-level details, these models can capture the essential interactions and dynamics that drive amyloid aggregation. This facilitates the discovery of assembly mechanisms and provides insight into the structure and stability of amyloid fibrils. In contrast to particle-based simulations, these simulations capture essential interactions and dynamics for non-covalent bond formation and breakage between aggregating proteins by direct dynamical modeling of graph structures. This approach of directly modeling network dynamics allows for exploration of timescales and larger system sizes many orders of magnitude larger than what is tractable using particle-based methods. Model parameterization is validated such that models are able to reliably reproduce experimentally measured mature fibril structures as an emergent phenomenon. Network Hamiltonian simulations can offer valuable insights into the thermodynamics, kinetics, and structural transitions involved in amyloid fibril assembly, which can aid in identifying targets for the design of potential therapeutic strategies; however, substantial technical challenges are inherent to parameter selection, as the parameter space is fraught with discontinuities and nonlinearities .

Based on the kinetic model and these rate constants, at 8 mM, ISC could account for up to 10% of triplets formed after 8 ns. So the assumption of negligible ISC made when fitting the bimolecular SF rate above is potentially invalid. We therefore refit the model with k ISC equal to 3.08 √ó 10 6 s -1 and found that for this level of ISC, k SF fits to lower range of (2.5 ¬± 0.6) √ó 10 9 M -1 s -1 (compared to (2.7 ¬± 0.6) √ó 10 9 M -1 s -1 for no ISC) (Table ).
