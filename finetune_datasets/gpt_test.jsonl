One essential step in any photoredox reaction is catalyst quenching via photoinduced electron transfer or energy transfer with either a substrate, additive, or co-catalyst. Identification of the correct quencher using Stern-Volmer studies is a necessary step mechanistic understanding; however, such studies are often cumbersome, low throughput and require specialized luminescence instruments. This report describes a high throughput method to rapidly acquire series of Stern-Volmer constants, employing readily available fluorescence plate readers and 96 well-plates. By leveraging multi-channel pipettors or liquid dispensing robots in combination with fast plate readers, the sampling frequency for quenching studies can be improved by several orders of magnitude. This new high-throughput method enabled the rapid collection of 220 quenching constants for a library of 20 common photocatalysts with 11 common quenchers. The extensive Stern-Volmer constants table generated greatly facilitates the systematic comparison between quenchers and can provide guidance to the synthetic community interested in designing and understanding catalytic photoredox reactions. \nQuestion:\n How many quenching constants did the new high-throughput method enable the rapid collection of?"}]}

To the best of our knowledge, this kind of reaction has never been described before and represents a new type of crossover system. The literature describes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis/alcoholysis of sulfinamides, and recently, two groups have reported transulfinamidation of primary sulfinamides with an excess of (hydroxyl)amines under metal catalysis. These are the closest examples of similar sulfinamide reactivity. Encouraged by the initial results, we set off to determine the scope of this reaction. First, the N-substituents were varied. Various tertiary sulfinamides with cyclic and acyclic aliphatic N-substituents underwent the crossover reaction with high yields, resulting in an almost equimolar mixture of products as determined by HPLC (Fig. ). Sulfinamides 1f and 2fbearing basic tertiary amino group can also serve as substrates for the crossover when 0.4 equivs of TFA catalyst is utilized. Secondary sulfinamides are also suitable substrates, as exemplified by Fig. entry 6. Interestingly, secondary sulfinamides 1h and 2h with an electron-poor aromatic N-substituent also provided the crossover products. Next, the combination of substrates 1a and 3b with S-aromatic and S-aliphatic substituents was tested.Despite the slower reaction rate (24 h reaction), a significant amount of the crossover products was also observed (entry 8). All crossover reactions of two substrates were performed in both directions, starting with a different set of substrates. A comparison of these experiments indicates that regardless of the starting substrates, the reactions lead to \nQuestion:\n How does the reaction rate of the combination of substrates 1a and 3b compare to the reaction rates of other sulfinamide reactions described?"}]}

A few methods have achieved quantitative protein translocation using caged CID systems or optogenetics . In these cases, the illumination dose was adjusted to control protein translocation levels. However, fine-tuning based on the illumination dose remains challenging, especially for caged CID systems. Because of the irreversible photolysis reaction, once the protein is translocated excessively than expected, it is difficult to reduce the translocation level. The photochromic CID system implemented quantitative and repetitive recruitment of the target protein. Because the photochromic CID system is based on fast and reversible photoisomerization of the ligand, protein recruitment is quantitatively regulated by the fraction of the active Z isomer. In this study, we demonstrated quantitative control by the illumination wavelength (Fig. ) and intensity ratio of dual-wavelength illumination (Fig. ). These single-and dual-wavelengthbased regulation methods enabled the control of subcellular protein translocation with prompt response, sufficient duration, quantitativeness, and reversibility. The photochromic CID system allowed the photoreversible recruitment of PINK1 on the MOM, unlike the traditional FKBP-FRB-based CID technique .

Then, we reported that the association of this reaction with a HAT catalyst provides the formation of benzoyl-SCF3 compounds when using aldehydes as starting materials.

Further investigations using reagent I are currently conducted in our laboratory and will be reported in due course.

The reaction mixture was stirred under 40w blue LED irradiation for 24 h allowing temperature to rise to 50 \u00b0C due to the proximity to the light. After completion, the reaction was quenched with a saturated brine solution, then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 10 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was then purified by column chromatography on silica gel. \nQuestion:\n What type of irradiation was the reaction mixture stirred under for 24 hours?"}]}

In agreement with the yellow color of azupyrene, the UV/Vis spectrum (Figure ) shows an absorption peak for azupyrene at a photon energy of 2.6 eV, in the blue part of the visible range. Pyrene has its lowest energy peak at a much higher photon energy of 3.7 eV, well outside the visible range. The resulting optical excitation energies, determined from the rising edge of the peak, are 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding a difference of 1.09 eV. Our ab initio calculations within the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) approach (see vertical lines in Figure ) overestimate the absolute excitation energies for both molecules. However, the calculations yield a difference in transition energies of 1.10 eV between azupyrene and pyrene, in excellent agreement with the experiment. It should be noted that while the lowest energy excitation corresponds to the transition from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO\u2192LUMO) in pyrene, this transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and the peak in the visible range has to be attributed to the transition into a higher lying unoccupied orbital (HOMO\u2192LUMO+1).

These results are competitive with standard transferable force fields, which have been extensively fit to properties such as these.To achieve our goal of employing the QUBE force field in computer-aided drug design applications, we require a compatible protein force field. Since the non-bonded parametrization strategy employed in QUBE is very different to that used in the standard biomolecular force fields (e.g. AMBER, OPLS, CHARMM), there is no reason to believe that they are compatible.

In this way, the number of fitting parameters is substantially reduced, and we have a consistent parametrization approach that can be applied to both small and large molecules, including entire biomolecular assemblies. Since, in this approach, all non-bonded parameters are derived from a single QM calculation, both the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters naturally include the native state polarization effects of the environment.

The KA from the kinetic model contains contributions from both the intrinsic binding affinity of the DNA and the binding affinity of the enzyme for the complexes, so both of these effective Kprod and Kinter values are expected to increase in the presence of the enzyme. The change in Kinter is consistent with a higher binding constant for the intermediate complex in the presence of enzyme.

Many applications (e.g., spectroscopy, photochemistry), require going beyond ground-state calculations and computing excited states. The development of quantum algorithms for molecular excited states is more challenging compared to the ground-state algorithms. The existing quantum algorithms for excited states often require a large number of qubits and gate operations, which precludes their application to larger systems. This is because the excited states often have more complex wavefunctions (open-shell, multi-configurational) even when the corresponding ground states are well behaved. Furthermore, in contrast to the ground state (which is unique in the sense that it is the lowest-energy state), there are many excited states, so the quantum algorithms should be capable of targeting a specific state (or states)e.g., the lowest energy states or states in a particular energy range, states of a particular symmetry/spin, states of a particular character, etc.The success of the VQE algorithm for ground-state calculations has inspired extensions to excited states, leading to variational quantum deflation (VQD) , subspace-search VQE (SSVQE) , and other algorithms . The underlying framework of all VQE-based methods is variational principle. The VQE-based methods for excited states employ supplementary constraints, so that the resulting algorithms look for a minimum-energy state orthogonal to the previously computed states. For example, the central element of VQD is the penalty terms in the cost function (which is subject to minimization).

The exponent \ud835\udc5b of the power law \ud835\udc5e #' , obtained from the fit, measures the ruggedness or dimensionality of the surface. During the CA, \ud835\udc5b varies between 2 and 3, which are typical values for non-smooth interfaces probed at low q. After a steeper decline at the beginning of the CA, \ud835\udc5b slowly increases, indicating that the contribution of compact deposits to the total GISAXS signal We found that the abrupt drop of the photocurrents occurring during the first few minutes of the chronoamperometric tests (Figure and Figure ) is dominated by the consumption of CuBi2O4 and the concurrent formation of metallic Bi at the surface of the electrode. This results from a cathodic photocorrosion process, in which the photogenerated electrons are consumed for the reduction of lattice Bi 3+ ions into Bi 0 , which segregates and crystallizes as a metallic Bi phase (eq. 1).cathodic photocorrosion (fast): Bi 3+ + 3e -\u21cc Bi 0 (eq. 1) (e -= photogenerated electrons)The quick formation of metallic Bi is not limited by use of a LED illumination but was also determined for a CuBi2O4 electrodes undergoing chronoamperometry under simulated solar radiation (Figure and Table ). \nQuestion:\n What does the exponent \ud835\udc5b measure in the context of general surface analysis?"}]}

The complex can then experience a cascade of processes involving different electronic states connected through the motion of the molecules' nuclei. The participation of different electronic states introduces new flexibility to the system by opening up reaction pathways beyond the ones that are accessible in thermal ground-state chemistry. This flexibility then lays the foundation to the many application found in photochemistry , covering areas as diverse as catalysis, memory storage, energy storage, display and lighting technology, or medicine. While a blessing for applications, the flexibility is a challenge for the rational design of photoactive materials, as it needs to control not only the properties of the different electronic states but also the motion connecting them. The fast time scale on which photochemical reactions often occur not only further limits the influence that can exerted on them, but also increases the difficulty to study such reactions in experiment.

Acylation of pMLKL oligomers would allow the local recruitment of VLCFAs to membrane regions that already possess different mechanical and structural properties, which facilitates their membrane disruption action.Second, we define the scope of protein VLCFAcylation during necroptosis using state-ofthe-art quantitative proteomics methods. Overall, we observe a decreased number of proteins are modified by a representative VLCFA during necroptosis. Pathway analysis conducted using proteins that show different levels of VLCFAcylation during necroptosis highlighted the enrichment of proteins belonging to the endocytic and lysosomal pathways. Previous studies have shown that pMLKL can associate with ESCRT proteins and flotillins which is suggested to result in the removal of pMLKL containing regions from the plasma membrane and their degradation. In parallel, flotillin association of pMLKL can result in its removal from the plasma membrane via exosomes. Based on these observations, it is clear that vesicular trafficking is key for maintenance of pMLKL and MLKL at the plasma membrane. We show that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulted in a strong rescue from cell death during necroptosis and decreased the levels of membrane bound pMLKL, whereas the whole cellular MLKL levels remained unchanged, suggesting that the inhibition of endocytosis pathway enhances the removal of pMLKL from the plasma membrane and preserves plasma membrane integrity. These results suggest for the first time that targeting endocytosis could be a way to delay membrane permeability during necroptosis.

Reforming: hydrogen is produced by reacting a fossil fuel with steam, thereby releasing hydrogen as well as carbon monoxide, a mixture commonly referred to as 'syngas':CmHn + mH2O -> mCO + (m+n/2)H2(1)2. Partial oxidation: in this process, a fossil fuel is combusted with a sub-stoichiometric amount of oxygen, leading to the production of syngas:CmHn + m/2O2 -> mCO + n/2H2 (2)Steam methane reforming (SMR) is the leading process to produce grey hydrogen. In 2021, the global hydrogen demand reached a peak of 94 Mt. Currently, about 48% of the hydrogen produced worldwide (~45 Mt in 2021) comes from SMR. This process consists of dehydrogenating methane (commonly from a natural gas stream) to produce a hydrogen-rich mixture, and it is the cheapest at the industrial scale. However, its environmental impact is very high: every kg of H2 produced in this way generates around 8 kg of CO2, indirectly. Oil and coal gasification are still heavily used, accounting for the 30% (~28 Mt) and 18% (~17 Mt) of the world's hydrogen production in 2021, respectively. Typically, grey hydrogen production processes include additional steps (e.g., water-gas shift and acid gas removal) to maximize the hydrogen yield and separate the carbon oxides from the hydrogen stream.Among the traditional methods of producing grey hydrogen (reforming and partial oxidation), autothermal reforming (ATR) is used in less proportion.

With careful dilution of the analyte solution, we found a detection limit of our MOF-based sensor to be as low as 5 fM (or 0.002 ng/L of PFOA) as shown in Figure &.

Let us first classify the different spectral regions by assigning them with names to aid the discussion of the dynamics in detail. Starting from the high energy side (Figure ), the difference spectra consist of an induced absorption (IA) band peaking around 330 nm (hereafter referred to as IA-330), and a ground state bleach (GSB) corresponding to the strong 355 nm absorption seen in the steady-state spectrum (denoted GSB-355). Further to the red, IA is again observed as a broad band stretching up to ca. 450 nm (IA-400), from where it is again replaced by a GSB signal exhibiting a clear vibronic-like structure -similar to the series of maxima observed in the red part of the absorption spectrum (GSB-550).

The regions circled in correspond to carbonyl carbon atoms, which are expected to be electron deficient and therefore require small A and B Lennard-Jones coefficients. Blue and dashed black lines represent lines of best fit and y = x respectively. The use of system-specific non-bonded parameters for biomolecular force fields allows for long-ranged polarization effects to be included, which is expected to improve the accuracy of the force field, particularly for measurements such as protein-ligand binding affinity that are sensitive to the electrostatic potential at the protein surface. A comparison of the QUBE and OPLS non-bonded parameters for ubiquitin is shown in Figure . Figures for the other proteins tested follow similar trends. As we have described, QUBE non-bonded parameters are derived directly from the QM partitioned electron density, and so, each atom has a unique charge and set of Lennard-Jones coefficients which depend on its environment. In contrast, the OPLS parameters are read from a library of atom types. The QUBE and OPLS charges correlate well with no clear outliers. As has previously been observed, the QUBE Lennard-Jones parameters show a far greater level of variation than OPLS (and most other force fields).One assumption employed in the use of system-specific charges for proteins (and small molecules) is that the derived parameter set is not too dependent on the molecular conformation.

In this work, we look to challenge this assumption by deriving system-specific non-bonded parameters, from linear-scaling QM simulations, for consistency with the QUBE small molecule force field. These non-bonded terms were used here alongside libraries of (non-bespoke) bond and angle parameters, derived using the modified Seminario method, and newly reparametrized torsional terms.We have shown here that using system-specific non-bonded force field parameters can result in accurate conformational preferences for short peptides. Rotamer populations and simulated J couplings for the dipeptide molecules are in good agreement with experimental data and compare favorably with the latest OPLS force field. For longer peptide molecules, the problems associated with fitting torsional parameters to a system-specific force field became more apparent. Using regularization in the fitting process was shown to overcome these issues and resulted in a J coupling error of just 0.90 \u00b1 0.03 for the alanine pentapeptide. Further work investigating disordered peptides will ascertain how general this fix is.The accuracy of the peptide simulations supports the use of our non-bonded and modified Seminario bonded parametrization strategies.

This is accomplished by checking all pairs of atoms, and adding a bond ifx j -x i < \u03c3 r cov i + r cov j ,(35)where x i and x j are the Cartesian position of atoms i and j, \u03c3 is a scalar parameter which in Sella defaults to 1.25, and r cov i and r cov j are the covalent radii of atoms i and j. After all pairs of atoms have been checked, a flood fill algorithm is used to count the number of disconnected fragments in the molecular graph. This algorithm works by walking along the graph and noting which atoms belong to the same fragment, then counting the number of distinct fragments. If only a single fragment is found, the algorithm exits; otherwise, \u03c3 is increased by 5 % and the above procedure is repeated with the additional rule that only pairs of atoms in different molecular fragments are checked for connectivity. This additional rule helps ensure that geometries with large separation between clusters of atoms do not become densely connected. This procedure For systems composed of independent molecules, it may not be chemically meaningful to consider internal coordinates that connect two molecules together. However, the previously described procedure will necessarily add bonds, angles, and dihedrals that span across molecules. This can have a negative impact on performance, as the optimizer will limit the extent to which these chemically irrelevant coordinates can change at each step. To resolve this problem, we also implement as an alternative the translational and rotation internal coordinates (TRIC) method of Wang and Song.

Notably, the mushroom tyrosinase was able to append GGGGY and RRRRY peptides to the GFP-E4Y without oxidizing the EEEEY tag. In addition, exposing the GFP-E4Y to abTYR resulted in no discernable oxidation by ESI-MS. This aligns with our previous peptide screens, and suggests that the EEEEY tag is not succeptible to abTYR activation (Figure ). Similarly, Y200C sfGFP-RRRRY (GFP-R4Y) was exposed to D55R megaTYR under similar conditions, with the EEEEY peptide used in place of the RRRRY peptide. Similarly to abTYR, D55R megaTYR was able to selectively oxidize the added peptides without modifying the tyrosine tag on the GFP-R4Y. Reaction selectivity was further confirmed when exposure of GFP-R4Y to D55R megaTYR alone did not result in any oxidation (Figure ). Together these data suggest that abTYR and D55R megaTYR can be used for CDSAT on proteins and peptides.To further validate reaction orthogonality we \nQuestion:\n What could generating sequence orthogonal tyrosinases enable the facile creation of by coupling anionic and cationic tagged subunits sequentially?"}]}

Thermal treatment at temperatures below 600 \u2070C followed by CO adsorption at room temperature develops a band at ~2237 cm -1 and exhibits a maximum at 2232 cm -1 when saturated (yellow trace, Fig. ). We recently demonstrated that the extra-framework aluminum (EFAL) species that form in zeolite after thermal/steaming treatment are alumina clusters formed during steaming with a high proportion of coordinatively unsaturated penta Al sites (due to their small size) : CO adsorption on these sites produces the presently observed band with a maximum at 2240-2232 cm - 1 . These sites form upon elution of mobile hydrated Al species from the framework and subsequent coalescence of the mobile species into alumina clusters/nanoparticles .Heating the H-FAU sample under vacuum to 650 \u2070C, followed by cooling and CO adsorption at room temperature (Fig. ), led to CO adsorbed on Al sites of alumina clusters as well as the immediate formation of a new signal ascribed to a Lewis acid site that coordinates CO with the C-O stretching frequency of 2252 cm -1 . Such a Lewis acid site has not been reported for any zeolite; this C-O stretching frequency of 2252 cm -1 is the highest known for any supported material. The high C-O stretching frequency suggests that this Lewis site is super-electrophilic and its ability to coordinate CO suggests that it is coordinatively unsaturated. We explored the properties of this site by pulling high vacuum (~10 -8 Torr) at room temperature, which leads to the disappearance of the CO band on alumina clusters but the 2252 cm -1 band is retained, signifying its stability (Fig. ).

The Int1proR,C has lower energy (6.7 kcal mol -1 ) than the Int1proS,C configuration (9.8 kcal mol -1 ), which favours the proR configuration pathway over the proS pathway.

The complex can then experience a cascade of processes involving different electronic states connected through the motion of the molecules' nuclei. The participation of different electronic states introduces new flexibility to the system by opening up reaction pathways beyond the ones that are accessible in thermal ground-state chemistry. This flexibility then lays the foundation to the many application found in photochemistry , covering areas as diverse as catalysis, memory storage, energy storage, display and lighting technology, or medicine. While a blessing for applications, the flexibility is a challenge for the rational design of photoactive materials, as it needs to control not only the properties of the different electronic states but also the motion connecting them. The fast time scale on which photochemical reactions often occur not only further limits the influence that can exerted on them, but also increases the difficulty to study such reactions in experiment.

Variance amongst the SOPS \u03bbmax (Soret and Q bands) is modest (Table ); the largest range can be seen in Q4, where the lowest (TPP-Si(OSi t BuMe2)2, 1c) and highest (TPP-Si(OSiPh3)2, 1i) \u03bbmax are Table  separated by 15 nm (618 and 633 nm, respectively). This absorption data demonstrates that the selection of a particular silyloxy cap can be used to control the structure of the porphyrin ring.The examined porphyrins were fluorescent in a dichloromethane solution (Table and Figure ). For 2 we observed a very strong emission band at 650 nm and a much smaller emission at 711 nm. This two-emission profile is typical of porphyrins, and is attributed to two tautomeric states. In toluene, 2 has the same \u03bbmax as in dichloromethane but emits relatively more intensely at 711 nm. This demonstrates that environmental effects (i.e. solvent) impact the population distribution of the two tautomers but not the energy of the individual HOMO-LUMO gaps.

Compound 3 permits the determination of the T1 level because the lowest energy level of Gd 3+ (32200 cm -1 ) is well above the S1 and T1 levels of NH2-BDC (as confirmed below) and therefore only phosphorescence of the ligand can be observed.The singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) energy levels of the ligand were determined as the onsets of the fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at about 405 nm (24700 cm -1 ) and 479 nm (20900 cm -1 ), respectively (see Figure and explanation within). The energy position of T1 with respect to the 5 DJ states of Ln 3+ is one of the most relevant factors to determine the lanthanide luminescence efficiency in coordination compounds is the energy of T1 with respect to the 5 DJ states of Ln 3+ . Previous studies have shown that for efficient room temperature Ln luminescence, the energy gap between the lowest T1 energy level and the emitting state of the lanthanide ion \u0394E ( 3 \u03c0\u03c0*-5 D0) should be larger than 2500 cm -1 . , To ensure a fast and irreversible energy transfer.

We have performed a joint computational and experimental study on the incorporation of Gd 3+ into AlN, creating a heterostructural alloy Al 1-x Gd x N between rocksalt GdN and wurtzite AlN. First-principles calculations using density functional theory in conjunction with SQS supercells reveal that the critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82. The calculated mixing free energy indicates that at equilibrium conditions and at temperatures below 1000 K, there is a large miscibility gap and only a few percent of Gd can be incorporated in AlN. Higher (effective) temperatures that can be accessed with non-equilibrium growth methods will enable higher Gd incorporation. By exploiting these non-equilibrium growth conditions experimentally via combinatorial RF co-sputtering, we have achieved significantly higher Gd concentrations in the wurtzite phase (x \u2248 0.25) than in previous thin film syntheses and therefore significantly expanded the range of alloys in this new materials system. Future growth optimization may be able to further increase the range of Gd that can be incorporated into AlN. Expanding our computational analysis to Pr 3+ and Tb 3+ , which show similar behavior to Gd 3+ , and comparing ionic size effects with electronegativity for all the cations that have been considered for substitution into AlN allows us to develop design rules for Al 1-x M x N alloys.

Owing to the synergistic effect of the AIE-molecular rotors (PE) and ACQ-based chromophore units (carbazole), JUC-557-nanosheet demonstrates high absolute quantum yields (up to 23.0%) in both solid-state and solution. Also, electron-rich carbazole and electron-deficient cyan are uniformly distributed and exposed on the channel wall, rendering efficient combining with the analytes for detection. Therefore, JUC-557nanosheet as a sensitive fluorescence sensor exhibits an excellent molecular recognition toward the essential element in the human body (Fe 3+ with K a of 1.98 \uf0b4 10 4 M -1 and LOD of 706 ppb), radioactive contaminant (I 2 with K a of 2.10 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and LOD of 302 ppb), explosive (TNT with K a of 4.38 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and LOD of 129 ppb), and especially toxic nitro-compounds (such as NB with K a of 6.18 \uf0b4 10 6 M -1 and LOD of 5 ppb), which is far superior to previous fluorescence detection materials, including COFs, MOFs, POPs, small molecule probes, and inorganics. Due to its high chemical stability, JUC-557nanosheet exhibits a good luminescence and sensitive molecule recognition even under extreme conditions, such as in strong acid with pH = 1 or strong base with pH = 14. Moreover, JUC-557-nanosheet can be assembled into visual detection equipment, allowing easy optical trace detection of various analytes. Finally, the molecular recognition mechanism was investigated by a combined theoretical and experimental studies, including TRPL measurements, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. Our study thus promotes the development of stable fluorescence COF nanosheets as novel versatile sensing platforms that could be integrated with electronic devices for environment monitoring. \nQuestion:\n What happens to the luminescence and molecule recognition capabilities of JUC-557nanosheet when exposed to a strong acid with pH 1?"}]}

Further, the effect of pressure on k1 is significant at low temperatures, but vanishes at temperatures above 600 K.The aforementioned unique temperature-and pressure-dependent behaviors are related to the properties of R1 potential energy surface (PES), which governs the reaction mechanism, kinetics, and dynamics.

The maximal entropy approach seeks to reconstruct the density matrix of the system in its most probable state in a situation of incomplete knowledge, when only partial information about the system is available. The commonly discussed scenario is when we know N mean values for a set of operators typically called the constraints. In general this set of expectation values is not sufficient to uniquely determine the state. Among all density operators that are consistent with the given mean values of the constraints we select the one (unique) density of whose entropy is maximal.This density operator is represented as an exponential function of those operators whose mean values are given. For this density matrix, the surprisal is a linear function of the operators that are the constraints with coefficients that are the Lagrange multipliers that arise in seeking a maximum of the entropy subject to constraints. The linearity of the surprisal as a function of the constraints is especially convenient when the operators do not commute and an exponential form in the operators calls for special handling, e.g., Ref. 22.An established route for the computation of the dynamical evolution of the surprisal is via an algebraic procedure for the dynamics of the constraints in the Heisenberg picture.

This approach combines the spiroketal forming step with a fragment coupling utilizing ortholactones as double electrophiles with silyloxyallylsilanes. We also discoved a rapid and regioselective isomerization of the exocyclic sprioketals to their endo-cyclic forms.Spiroketals are an important functional group in many natural products that possess potent medicinal properties. 1 As a result, they have increasingly become targets of interest by the pharmaceutical industry, 2 with ivermectin, 3 and tofogliflozin licensed as therapeutics (Scheme 1A). In many cases, the barrier to advancing the clinical development of complex spirocyclic natural products, such as the spongistatins, 5 is the availability of compound from either natural or synthetic sources. As a result, new modular and convergent methods for spiroketal formations are needed. Many of the commonly utilized methods for spiroketal synthesis rely on generating a linear molecule containing two pendent alcohols with a central ketone, dithiane, or surrogate, followed by cyclization to form the ketal moiety (Scheme 1B). 1e-f,7 While these methods are competent methods to synthesize these molecules, they can lead to long linear-step counts and problems diversifying the structure.

The deviation of the \u03be full curve from the Tersoff/ZBL curve is consequently not as much as other AC and SDAC curves after 0.1 ps. This is not an advantage, however, since other aspects of the dynamics (such as v max ) become worse.The number of defects stabilizes as the system cools down to 300 K at about 10 ps. For SDAC with/without transition forces, the numbers of defects left at 10 ps are either in between that of the SW and the Tersoff/ZBL potentials or very close to that of the SW potential. For AC simulations, however, the numbers of defects left at 10 ps are much less. This demonstrates the deficiency of the AC method in the simulation of DD generation. The AC method can only partition the system according to geometrical criteria. With the AC method, the collision of atoms is treated with the higher-level method only after atoms are very close to each other, and is treated with the lowerlevel method when atoms are not close enough (Fig. ), so the description of the collision process is inconsistent. This affects the geometries of the defect clusters and leads to the much faster healing of damage. The entire collision process is described consistently by the higher-level method in SDAC simulations, and the resulting annealing behaviors in Fig. are more reasonable.Fig. shows the geometries of the amorphous disordered regions in the simulations at 0.15 ps and at 10 ps.

The B3LYP functional gives weaker binding energies than the CCSD(T) benchmarks, and prior work by Zhang et al. suggested that this under-binding becomes more pronounced with increasing molecular size. As such, B3LYP will incur significant errors for the large periodic strands, as we demonstrate in the next section. Based on these benchmark calculations, the B3LYP-D functional most closely matches the CCSD(T) results, particularly for the van-der-Waalsstacked monomers. In contrast, both the BLYP and B3LYP functionals produce geometries that are highly distorted in which the individual Watson-Crick base pairs are not even aligned in the same plane. A frequency analysis can give further information on structural stability; however, geometry optimizations of these large, periodic systems were already computationally expensive (requiring hundreds of thousands of CPU hours), and frequency calculations were out of reach for these structures. For this reason, we only present the structures in Figure , which clearly depict the base pairs to be misaligned with each other to depict the distortions/instabilities in these structures. The structural deformations in these periodic strands are fully consistent with the benchmark calculations described in the previous section.

For the alanine and glycine scans, the error for the QUBE force field evaluated using eq 5 is 1.25 kcal/mol compared to 0.93 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M, which is a reasonable level of agreement. For proline and serine, the errors remain comparable to OPLS-AA/M.For the sidechain torsional parameters (Section S3.3), the mean error in the recreation of the QM potential energy scans for the QUBE force field is 1.29 kcal/mol, compared to 1.12 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M. Particularly high errors occur for both the \u03c7 1 and \u03c7 2 glutamic acid scans, and the glutamine \u03c7 2 scan. For glutamic acid, the error is also high for the OPLS-AA/M force field parameters, but the rotamer populations remained close to the experimental data, and this may be due to a problem with the functional form used in classical force fields. The OPLS-AA/M error in the potential energy scan for glutamine is roughly half that of the QUBE force field. However, as we will show, the accuracy of the glutamine dipeptide MD simulations is good, and so no further refinement was made to the sidechain torsional parameters in this work.Although a low error in the reproduction of the QM potential energy surface is clearly the desired result, this does not necessarily correspond to accurate non-bonded force field parameters. The degree to which torsional parameters can improve the fit between MM and QM scans depends not only on the accuracy of the non-bonded, and bond and angle, parameters, but also on the shape of the energy difference between the QM and MM scans.The functional form used in classical MM force fields is very restrictive.

Thus for high fidelity readout the pump-detect block must be equally sensitive to in-and anti-phase coherences.

A column-mobile phase combination provided a maximum of eleven peaks under the conditions used (i.e., naphthyl column using acetonitrile as a co-solvent). This column was then used to study the effect of different chromatographic parameters on the separation (i.e., % co-solvent, backpressure, temperature, and flow rate).Backpressure and temperature showed non-linear behavior in the separation of the different OLED isomeric components in terms of resolution and retention. When using HPLC, the separation of the OLED isomeric sample showed co-elution and higher elution time. In contrast, analytical SFC offered a better resolution and faster separation speed than HPLC for the sample studied. It can be hypothesized that supercritical fluid chromatography in the preparative scale would be a rapid and efficient tool to purify OLED compounds, particularly removing potential  2 .Figure 1 .21Figure 1.

The HPLC separation of OLED compounds, especially in the case of structural homologs/analogs and geometric/optical isomers of OLEDs, often entails compromised resolution due to the lack of selectivity (tend to co-elute). Chromatographic method development for such structurally similar compounds and isomers is laborious and timeconsuming. Moreover, impurities or degradation products are often structurally very similar to the analytes; as a result, they elute on the front or tail of the main analyte peak or potentially remain hidden under the target chromatographic peak. In such a scenario, it becomes practically difficult for the analysts to detect and remove impurities from the main peak, especially in the preparative scale when the higher mass load becomes critical. In addition to the chromatographic resolution, HPLC analysis of OLEDs, in most cases, involves normal phase chromatography that utilizes 100% organic solvents as the mobile phase due to the low solubility of the most OLED compounds in the aqueous-based solvents. Utilization of such a high volume of organic solvent is hazardous from the environmental perspective and costly.Sivasubramaniam, et al. utilized three columns in series and used 100% acetonitrile as the mobile phase to separate a standard mixture of only four OLED compounds in about 50 minutes -this is an example of HPLC separation of OLEDs with a considerable waste of time and resources. Therefore, the utilization of preparative HPLC for the purification of OLEDs becomes a poor choice due to the requirement of excessive energy and high dry-down time to deal with such a high volume of organic solvent. This will also create a bottleneck in the postcollection workflow of the purification process and the overall productivity. It would be of great \nQuestion:\n What happens when impurities elute on the front or tail of the main analyte peak or potentially remain hidden under the target chromatographic peak during HPLC analysis of OLEDs?"}]}

AP-MM/MM simulations show that the SDAC method improves over the previous AC method, since the SDAC dynamics, number of defects, and the shape of the disordered region agrees better with those of the 'higherlevel' MM method than the AC results. Although the motivation for developing the SDAC method is for the simulation of the DD generation, the method is applicable to general problems in which active regions may occur or vanish during the simulation and have a speed dependence, such as the dynamics of shockwaves or collisions.The SDAC PES is speed-dependent, and the usual EOM in MD becomes inapplicable. I develop an energy-conserving SDAC EOM, which is different from Newton's second law by the SDEM term. The time integration of the non-standard EOM is carried out with the EPS algorithm. The dynamics of the SDAC QM/MM system can be expected to be close to that of the real system when the SDEM is much smaller than atomic masses. I show that the size of the SDEM can be effectively tuned by the functional form of the SDAC criterion property, which allows the SDAC method to be applicable in general systems.The transition forces in AP-QM/MM lead to geometry distortions and artificial heating. The same effect is observed in the SDAC simulations, and is found to be significant when the higher-level and lower-level methods of QM/MM differ a lot. I find that discarding the transition forces \nQuestion:\n How does the effectiveness of the SDAC method in AP-QM/MM simulations compare to the previous AC method?"}]}

The substituted pyrroles and phthalic acids required as starting materials are synthetically challenging and scarcely commercially available. Porphyrins, on the other hand, possess bridging methines connecting their pyrrole rings that serve as convenient handles for meso substitution. This meso substitution is readily achieved by simply forming the porphyrin from commercially available aldehydes, of which there are many. Therefore, a robust procedure for \u03ba 4 Nsilylation of porphyrin derivatives is an appealing target that would provide access to PorSil materials that combine the electronic tuneability of porphyrins with the improved physical properties of Si-Pcs.Here, we describe a straightforward and general synthetic approach to PorSils (Scheme 1), which has allowed us to elaborate them into a new class of porphyrins, bissilyloxy PorSils (SOPS). Investigation of this series of SOPS (1a-i) based on 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP, 2) revealed that the axial substituents not only serve to solubilize the porphyrin but also to tune their optical and electronic properties. \nQuestion:\n Why is meso substitution in porphyrins more readily achieved compared to peripheral functionalization in Si-Pcs?"}]}

Both works showed that few geometric descriptors related to the backbone of the protein afford with convenient information to predict metalbinding sites rather than focusing only on the first coordination sphere donors (mainly side chains) that coordinate the metal.BioMetAll represents a major step forward in how to predict metal-binding sites in proteins. The approach stands on the geometric information extracted from a collection of about 171000 biological complexes to infer a combination of geometric rules that are used to evaluate the regions of a protein for metal binding. The program accurately reproduces the experimental metal-binding motifs on a benchmark of 53 structures. Furthermore, we present three specific case studies to illustrate its potential. BioMetAll is efficient to i) predict metal-binding sites with particular amino acid motifs even for non-canonical metal coordinating amino acids and backbone atoms; ii) determine transient metal-binding sites in structures that need conformational changes to reach the complete coordination sphere, which could be related to metal diffusion pathways; and even iii) predict potential mutations of an existing protein to generate convenient metal-binding sites. This new approach can make a significant contribution to future development in fields like metalloenzyme and metallodrug design. \nQuestion:\n Why is BioMetAll considered a major step forward in predicting metal-binding sites in proteins?"}]}

Here, we compute aqueous-phase VIEs for a set of inorganic anions, some of which partition preferentially at the air/water interface, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. The results are in excellent agreement with experiment, regardless of whether the simulation data are restricted to ions at the air/water interface or to those in bulk liquid water. Although the computed VIEs are sensitive to ion-water hydrogen bonding, we find that the short-range solvation structure is sufficiently similar in the bulk and interfacial environments that it proves impossible to discriminate between the two on the basis of the VIE, a conclusion that has important implications for the interpretation of liquid-phase photoelectron spectroscopy. More generally, analysis of the simulation data suggests that partitioning of soft anions at the air/water interface is largely a second (or third) solvation shell effect, arising from disruption of water-water hydrogen bonds and not from significant changes in first-shell anion-water hydrogen bonding. \nQuestion:\n Why does the short-range solvation structure appear similar in both bulk and interfacial environments, making it impossible to discriminate between the two based on the VIE?"}]}

The determination of an appropriate discount rate is complex, requiring a holistic approach that considers market distortions caused by subsidies, the technicalities of integrating renewables into existing systems, and the social implications of community involvement. Moreover, it necessitates a comprehensive analysis of various factors, including interest rates, expected returns, the time frame of the analysis, and risk premiums, while also adapting to extraordinary conditions such as pandemics, global conflicts, climate issues, and other unique challenges associated with renewable energy projects.

Using the rate constants fit to a system with aggregates would overestimate the rates at more dilute, diffusion-limited concentrations. The underestimation of triplet excitons at 8 mM by the Dover model is partially explained by the underestimation of SF and overestimation of excimer formation: if excimers predominantly result from aggregates and are absent at lower concentrations, then collisions at 8 mM are more likely to result in SF, and more triplet formation.Additionally, the presence of aggregates would explain the fast rate of triplet fusion at high TIPS-Tn concentration. If SF at 300 mM occurs on an aggregated pair of TIPS-Tn molecules, then the triplets are not well separated spatially and can recombine quickly. However, in a dilute solution with no aggregates, in which SF occurs during transient collisions, the molecules may diffuse away before the triplets recombine. Therefore the triplet fusion rate would be lower and a more significant amount of triplets would be observed. We note that the presence of aggregates at 300 mM does not affect the main conclusion of the study by Dover et al., i.e., that the excimer is a trap state rather than an intermediate. However, for the remainder of this study, we revert to the much simpler model shown in Eqs. ( ) and ( ) to describe SF in this system.As mentioned previously, we neglect the reverse SF process, triplet fusion, in this model. This assumption is justified in TIPS-Pn, as fusion is energetically uphill. For both TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn, the model fits well without triplet fusion, and so presumably it plays only a minor role. The other assumption made here is that the ISC rate is negligible compared to SF, but, as we show below, this assumption may not necessarily be the case. \nQuestion:\n What happens if SF at 300 mM occurs on an aggregated pair of TIPS-Tn molecules?"}]}

For transition metal complexes, despite their typically large number of vibrational degrees of freedom and many close-lying electronic states, it becomes affordable to screen the nonadiabatic dynamics of many individual ones in order to test and establish design principles to improve their photophysical and photochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate this by screening the photophysics of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes derived from VCl 3 (ddpd). This complex, after excitation from the triplet ground state and following intersystem crossing to the singlet manifold, shows singlet-to-triplet phosphorescence in the nearinfrared region. Based on an analysis of the relaxation mechanism of VCl 3 (ddpd), we developed the hypothesis that by increasing the ligand-field strength in the complex could shift the electronic states to modify the mechanism in such a way as to lead to a higher phosphorescence yield. This was to be achieved by channeling more population from the triplet to the singlet states as well as reducing the amount of singlet-to-triplet reverse intersystem crossing that reduces the population available for phosphorescence.We then tested our hypothesis in two steps. First, we designed 18 complexes based on design principles established for other 3dmetal complexes with large ligand-field splitting. Thereby we found that strategies of including ligands that are strong \u03c3 -donors or both \u03c3 and \u03c0 donors are particularly successful. Among the 18 candidates complexes, we identified four complexes with ligandfield splitting \nQuestion:\n What is the step before identifying four complexes with significant ligand-field splitting in testing the hypothesis for higher phosphorescence yield?"}]}

To analyze the magnetic configurations, we use \u03b1\u03b2 Mulliken Population Analysis (MPA). This analysis revealed that the magnetic state of intercalated TMs is dependent on the concentration: Co and V intercalations are FM for configurations TM-01 through TM-04, but FiM for the TM-05 configuration. Cu intercalation is non-magnetic throughout all configurations. Finally, Cr, Fe, Mn, Sc, and Ti intercalations can be FM, AFM, or FiM, depending on TM concentration.Furthermore, in these compounds, the magnetic behavior of intercalated atoms can be highly dependent not only on their concentration, but also on their position. In particular, we highlight that some TM atoms have reduced unpaired electron density depending on their position. For example, for Cr intercalation, the \u03b1\u03b2 (unpaired) electron population is larger for Cr atoms intercalated at the centroid of boroxine or triazine rings, compared to those intercalated at the centroid of benzene rings, with the exception of Cr-02 where magnetic moments are reduced in triazine rings.

Thus, we turned our attention to study the reactivity of Ni-Ni species with an appropriate nucleophilic counterpart (Scheme 7). As anticipated, 1-phenylnaphthalene 9 (61%) was exclusively obtained upon exposure of 1 to PhMgBr at rt after 1 h. Under the limits of detection, not even traces of 2-phenylnaphthalene 10 were detected in the crude mixtures. Interestingly, however, statistical mixtures of 9:10 were found by addition of PhMgBr after exposure of 1 to 50 \u00baC for 6 h, thus confirming that \"ringwalking\" might constitute a new vehicle for enabling bond formation at distal C(sp 2 )-H bonds of aryl pivalates.

The first \uf070* resonance of pyrene has two maxima, which are caused by the C1s\u2192LUMO and C1s\u2192LUMO+1 excitations, as was ascertained by MO-projected NEXAFS simulations (see Figure in the SI and Ref. ). For azupyrene, the individual excitations in the first peak are not resolved, because the corresponding LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals are too close in energy. For both molecules, the MO-projected NEXAFS simulations show that the leading edge of the adsorption peak is determined by the C1s\u2192LUMO excitation.The X-ray absorption edge of azupyrene appears at a lower photon energy by 0.37 eV than that of pyrene, as can be seen in Figure . Since the core-level energies differ only marginally, it can therefore be concluded that the LUMO of azupyrene is lower in energy. Theory also predicts the LUMO of azupyrene to be lower in energy, here the magnitude is 0.60 eV.Combination of the experimental differences of electron addition and removal energies from UPS and NEXAFS data indicate that the electronic band gap is 0.72 eV (= 0.37 eV + 0.35 eV) smaller for azupyrene than for pyrene. For comparison, the calculations yield a value of 0.87 eV for the difference in electronic band gap, which is in good agreement with the experimental finding. In addition, the calculations can provide the absolute electronic band gaps, which are not accessible by the experimental techniques at our disposal.

As in GCEQ or CCEQ setup, potential is developed due to the charge accumulation on electrode surface, it is expected that surface polarity of the electrode is the key factor for the generated potential. Thus, we may expect mesoporous carbon electrode may be a very good nonmetal electrode we are searching for. This is used in IDM which supports this proposal. In Fig.  For CCEQ setup, we need co-coexistence of sea water and river water or pond water. The natural source is of course where a river mixes with the sea. But, we can't only depend on natural sources as it is limited and in some cases may not be suitable for contraction of a power station. Thus, we may make water reservoir near the sea which would be filled by rain water. A porous barrier should be placed between sea water and rain water. Such a model is shown in Fig. .On the other hand setup of GCEQ power station is very trivial. A model is shown in Fig. . We may use carbon electrode with metal electrode or fabricated electrode. We have to properly placed our electrodes and connect them. But, if there is a flow of water it would be better for power generation. Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .12Fig. 1.

Pyrene-based materials have found application in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs). One of the most important driving forces enabling the use of pyrene over a wide range of applications is the possible functionalization of its molecular backbone. Accordingly, previous research in the field has focused on modifying the properties of pyrene by introducing substituents at the periphery of the molecule or by incorporating pyrene units into semiconducting polymers. In contrast, the influence of the topology of the \uf070-electron system on the properties of pyrene has not yet been addressed.During the past years, the importance of topology for the molecular properties of organic semiconductors has been increasingly recognized. The inherent promise for performance improvements resulted in a revived interest in nonalternant \uf070-electron systems and first efforts to use the related molecules in (opto)electronic devices have been made. However, most of the related studies focus on azulene and its derivatives. In this study, we explore the influence of the \uf070-topology on the properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by comparing pyrene (Figure , left) with its isomer azupyrene (Figure , \nQuestion:\n In what have pyrene-based materials found application?"}]}

In these applications, the zeroth generation was created by centering a randomly distributed point cloud in parameter space around parameters for each fibril topology, which were previously published by Grazioli et al . The results of these parameter evolutions, carried out on a 48 node system, are shown in Figure . The evolution of the 1,2 2-ribbon is highlighted, as it is both the amyloid fibril topology most commonly observed in nature , and it exhibited a substantial increase in fibril fraction as a result of applying our genetic algorithm.

As a precaution to rule out the possibility that the genetic algorithm had converged on ideal parameters for smaller systems that might not scale to larger systems, the best generations from the 48 node evolutions for each of the 5 fibril types were then used as the first generation for an additional evolution squence carried out on a 256 node system.

XPS spectra of Cu-HTTP films before and after exposure to PFOA solutions revealed substantial changes in oxidation states on the MOF's coordination center as shown in Figure d, e and Fig. . Noticeably, after exposure, the relative ratio of Cu 1+ to Cu +2 in the MOF decreased, indicating that the presence of PFAS results in substantial changes in the oxidation state of the copper atoms, which as stated above, are key species towards maintaining charge neutrality within the MOF. The observed changes in oxidation state of copper should be accompanied by changes in binding energy of the oxygen atoms along the periphery of the copper center, which is what we observe after exposing Cu-HHTP to PFOA. Indeed, the location of maximum intensity in the O 1s XPS spectra shifts to higher binding energy, accompanied by a change in peak shape as Cu-HTTP switches between its benzenoid and quinoid forms (Fig. <ref \nQuestion:\n Why does the presence of PFAS result in substantial changes in the oxidation state of the copper atoms in the Cu-HHTP MOF film?"}]}

Beyond its effect on solubility, silylation modifies the optical and electronic profiles of Pcs, which has led to over 1000 papers discussing the synthesis, properties, and applications of silylated Pcs (Si-Pcs).

The complexity of this problem increases with the size and flexibility of the system, and the challenge becomes especially difficult in the rational design of open-shell transition-metal complexes where many electronic states and nuclear degrees of freedom participate in the excited-state dynamics. The only alternative is then to screen larger numbers of compounds as is done in the present work using computer simulations for a class of near-infrared emitting vanadium(III) complexes. Starting from the mechanism of the known emitter VCl 3 (ddpd) (ddpd = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-dipyridine-2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine), we establish design principles including an increase in the ligand-field strength in the complex in order to achieve higher emission quantum yields. Based on these principles, we design a large set of complexes that are tested for larger ligandfield splitting in static quantum chemistry calculations. For the subset of complexes with increased ligand-field splitting, we then perform nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and identify two promising near-infrared emitter with potential similar or increased emission quantum yield compared to the VCl 3 (ddpd) reference.

ImageJ software was used to analyze the fluorescence profiles of the photographs . The photographs were imported into ImageJ as a stack, which creates a stack of equally sized images that are superimposed one on top of the other. A radial line from the origin of the single sheets to just beyond the end of the mixed sheet is drawn on one of the images in the stack. ImageJ will then place the radial line at the exact same location on the other images in the stack. After the radial line is drawn, a profile of the gray scale values (a proxy for the fluorescence intensity) for each pixel along the radial line is created for each image in the stack.The profiles of fluorescence intensity with time for the radial lines of all solutions were exported to a spreadsheet for further analysis.

The background fluorescence (expressed as a gray scale pixel intensity) was subtracted from the ImageJ measured gray scale intensities using method 1 listed in reference .

The maximal entropy approach seeks to reconstruct the density matrix of the system in its most probable state in a situation of incomplete knowledge, when only partial information about the system is available. The commonly discussed scenario is when we know N mean values for a set of operators typically called the constraints. In general this set of expectation values is not sufficient to uniquely determine the state. Among all density operators that are consistent with the given mean values of the constraints we select the one (unique) density of whose entropy is maximal.This density operator is represented as an exponential function of those operators whose mean values are given. For this density matrix, the surprisal is a linear function of the operators that are the constraints with coefficients that are the Lagrange multipliers that arise in seeking a maximum of the entropy subject to constraints. The linearity of the surprisal as a function of the constraints is especially convenient when the operators do not commute and an exponential form in the operators calls for special handling, e.g., Ref. 22.An established route for the computation of the dynamical evolution of the surprisal is via an algebraic procedure for the dynamics of the constraints in the Heisenberg picture.

Based on this fact, Behler and co-workers exploited the high flexibility of the NN to search the poorly sampled regions of the configuration space.

Recently, Lin et al. proposed a trajectory-free active learning method, based on this idea, to iteratively add new data points for sampling. It has been demonstrated that an accurate PES can be developed with much fewer points than the trajectory-based methods.In this work, we also utilize the limited extrapolation capabilities of NN potential to select points from the DFT dataset.

These results suggested that product inhibition is important as the rate of dissociation of the template:product strongly influences the success of the self-replication. Yet the overall stability of the intermediate complex also plays a significant role, which had until now been overlooked. In addition, simulations were conducted with 5 x kcat and 0.2 kcat to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the rate of ligation. When the kcat is 5 times faster than the value determined from our best fit of the data, the self-replication was much faster than what we observed. Conversely, the ligation rate was much slower when kcat was reduced by a factor of (0.2 x kcat), resulting in slow amplification of the templates (Figure ). These simulations are consistent with previous work that showed a strong dependence of replication on the magnitude of kcat of ligation. These simulations reveal two important take-home messages for developers of nonenzymatic self-replicating systems: they should focus on ways to stabilize the intermediate complex as well as ways to destabilize the product duplex and select rapid ligation strategies. Regarding the latter, very little product was observed within the first 7200 seconds (2 hours) of reaction when kcat was reduced to 0.1kcat (simulation not shown).Next, to provide some insight as to how the presence of the abasic affected the interactions with the enzyme, we determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat and Km for the ligation reaction in Cycle I for the system with and without the abasic group.

A hallmark of necroptosis is the membrane permeabilization and rupture that is mediated by mixed linage kinase like protein (MLKL). This membrane rupture is linked to the inflammatory properties of necroptosis and is critical for disease states involving this process. It is established that electrostatic interactions between phosphatidyl inositol phosphates and phosphorylated MLKL (pMLKL) oligomers facilitate the membrane recruitment of pMLKL. In efforts to understand how lipids might contribute to necroptosis, we previously showed that saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulate and that they are functionally involved in this process. Our results also indicated that protein fatty acylation by VLCFAs can be a mechanism by which VLCFAs contribute to this process. Here we define the scope of protein acylation by saturated VLCFAs during necroptosis. First we show that, although there is an overall decrease in acylation, some proteins, including MLKL and pMLKL, are exclusively acylated during necroptosis. Reducing the levels of VLCFAs decreases the membrane recruitment of MLKL and pMLKL and rescues from cell death, suggesting that acylation by VLCFAs contributes to membrane localization of pMLKL and subsequent membrane permeabilization. Acylation of MLKL and pMLKL occur downstream of phosphorylation and oligomerization and appear to be S-linked. Second, we show that disruption of clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway results in a strong rescue in cell viability during necroptosis, likely by removal of pMLKL from the plasma membrane. Altogether, we show for the first time that MLKL and pMLKL can be acylated during necroptosis. We also show that disruption of endocytosis presents a promising strategy to delay membrane permeabilization and cell death during necroptosis \nQuestion:\n How do VLCFAs contribute to the process of necroptosis?"}]}

Present in about 30% of the known genome, their impacts on molecular and cellular processes are countless. Since biometallic complementarities sustain many mechanisms in living systems, they are essential for their adaptation to the environment and key to their health. Understanding how metallic moieties interact with biological systems is not just a healthrelated question. It is also a source of inspiration for the development of new synthetic routes, including environmentally friendly ones. As such, chemists have long intended to mimic biometallic synergies for industrial purposes. In the form of small amenable chemical systems (biomimetics) or complex de novo enzymes, a substantial part of chemical efforts focuses on reproducing or even extending Nature's bioinorganic repertoire.The specific problem of predicting where and how metallic moieties bind to proteins is of crucial importance in numerous areas of chemistry and its closest interfaces. After decades, researchers in bioinorganics still intensively work on decoding the exact weight of the different molecular variables that are involved in the construction of biometallic edifices (charges of the metal ions and their amino acid environment versus electric field of the entire protein, redox properties of the metal, etc.). In silico approaches offer an excellent option to get a better insight into metal-protein interactions and help in establishing predictive patterns.

This model is able to capture the behavior of TIPS-Tn reasonably well.

While this is most certainly a step in the direction, the increased computational cost compared to cc-pwCV[TQ5]Z calculations is immense: the augmentation of the basis set increases the number of basis functions by 20%, and the amount of memory required for the computation of the connected triples (ie. the (T) component) more than doubles.

This shorter inter-ring distance leads to strong orbital overlap allowing an effective transannular charge transfer between the phenyl rings.

In addition to these special properties its synthetic diversities and feasibility of its derivative provide an opportunity to investigate the structural relationship in terms of its orientation, and functionalization as through-space conjugation is highly sensitive to the molecular geometry and electronic structures. This charge delocalization and energy transfer was explained by theoretical results which indicate the energy band gap between the molecular orbital of [2,2] paracyclophane is 3.72 eV which is about 1.4 eV smaller than that of benzene (5.15 eV), demonstrating it is more effective and expansive \u03c0-conjugated \nQuestion:\n What is the short distance between the two slightly-bent aromatic rings in the face-to-face arrangement?"}]}

Multichannel pipettors enabled the rapid dispensing of each component across the entire plate. To maintain a strict inert atmosphere around the samples, the entire sample preparation and measurement was performed under inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen filled glovebox in constant purge mode. This was made possible by the small footprint of the fluorescence plate reader, which can easily be introduced into a glovebox. To validate this design, we sought to test our approach by comparing Ksv values obtained with our workflow to values reported in the literature. We probed the quenching of (2,2'-Bipyridine)bis[2pyridinyl-\uf06bN)phenyl-\uf06bC]iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) by diethylbromomalonate, bromoacetonitrile and indole in dichloroethane (DCE) and observed similar trends in the quenching values, with diethylbromomalonate exhibiting a higher Ksv than bromoacetonitrile by a factor of 1.7 (in the original report, the factor is 2) and indole showing virtually no quenching (Figure ).  However, we measured higher quenching constants overall by a factor of ~2. This difference is likely because of our ability to consistently maintain the sample in an inert atmosphere throughout the entire measurement using this workflow.With this positive validation result in hand, we sought to showcase the magnitude of quenching data accessible through this high-throughput method.

The other main applications for extracting energy from hydrogen are proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, considered mainly due to their higher efficiency (~50%) with respect to ICEs (~30%); the operation of PEM fuel cells has already been extensively covered in the literature. There are several kinds of mobility applications including LDVs (light-duty vehicles i.e., passenger cars), MDVs (medium-duty vehicles e.g., vans, public transport buses), and HDVs (heavy-duty vehicles like long-haul trucks and coaches).Regarding LDVs, fuel cell vehicles have existed in the market for longer than a decade, with Japanese and Korean car manufacturers being the most prominent in the market. The main challenge with respect to LDVs is the availability of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs), although the current support for hydrogen-based mobility has accelerated the HRS market, from 330 stations available in 2017 to 540 in 2020. Besides the infrastructure availability, the cost of the LDVs fuel cell and hydrogen as fuel are considered a challenge to be overcome by the development of both suitable transport and storage infrastructure. Undeniably, the governmental policies aimed at abating carbon emissions in mobility are \nQuestion:\n Which are more efficient, proton exchange membrane fuel cells or internal combustion engines?"}]}

Technology companies worldwide are constantly pursuing more sophisticated versions of these devices to keep up with the highly competitive consumer electronics market. An indispensable component of \"smart\" devices is the display, which is a technology that is continuously raising the bar to achieve more realistic display performance. The current global display market is segmented into two primary technologies: liquid crystal display (LCD) and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display. LCD is currently the most ubiquitous display due to its good image quality, reasonable price, and energy efficiency. However, scientists' insatiable appetite for game-changing technologies has led to the discovery and commercialization of LCD's only competitor -OLED technology. OLED has excelled over the current LCD technology in several display metrics, such as lower power consumption, wider viewing angle, expanded color gamut, faster response time, and higher contrast ratio, among others. Such distinctive and unprecedented display features have enabled the modern OLED display to deliver incredibly realistic images. OLED is also at the forefront of the ultra-thin, lightweight, flexible, foldable, and even rollable display, making it the most futuristic display technology in the current market. Thus, OLED is considered the most exciting and promising display technology that is progressively replacing LCD in many existing applications.OLED can still be considered an emerging technology; there is \nQuestion:\n How does the power consumption and viewing angle of OLED compare to that of LCD?"}]}

Haber-Bosch facilities are currently built in locations that have access to natural gas and are close to chemical industrial centers. The cost of ammonia production today is heavily influenced by the scale of production and the price of natural gas (Figure ). Smaller production scales result in higher production costs due to limited economies of scale, equipment costs, and labor costs that do not decrease proportionately with the scale. Ideally, Haber-Bosch facilities operate on production scales in the range of thousands of metric tons per day, enabling them to achieve production costs as low as 250 USD/t N H 3 when natural gas prices are low (\u223c 2 USD/MMBtu). However, as production scales decrease (\u223c 50 tpd), the production cost can increase by more than five times to 1,300 USD/t N H 3 . Moreover, even at large production scales, the production cost of ammonia is highly sensitive to natural gas prices. In early 2022, natural gas prices went from around 2 USD/MMBtu to over 40 Given the centralized nature of the Haber-Bosch process, there are fewer than a hundred production facilities worldwide. These facilities are predominantly located in rich countries that have access to inexpensive natural gas and advanced chemical infrastructure. The average distance between the Haber-Bosch facilities and farms is around 1,200  km. However, it is important to note that despite the presence of nearby Haber-Bosch facilities, certain regions in the world still struggle to meet their regional demand for ammonia. This can be attributed to various factors such as limited infrastructure, inadequate access to resources, or economic constraints.

Even the most efficient OER electrocatalysts to date show significant overpotentials (up to 0.4 V), which leads to a significant amount of energy being spent on producing oxygen, a product with low market value. As a result, the deployment of the green hydrogen production market is hindered: green hydrogen currently accounts for only 4% of the overall production worldwide, equivalent to 3.8 Mt in 2021. Interestingly, this is in line with the amount of electricity produced worldwide using solar PV, accounting for 3.6% (179 TWh in 2021). Therefore, boosting the largescale production of green hydrogen requires the parallel optimization and scale-up of both solar PV and electrolyzers. Value-added oxidation reactions are an attractive pathway to further reduce green hydrogen production costs by reducing energy consumption and adding market value. Biomass electrolysis offers a potential solution to replace the sluggish OER at the anodic side of (photo)electrolyzers with the more favorable organic molecule oxidation, which could lead to a more efficient production process. The hydrogen produced in this way is still considered \"green\" since biomass is recognized as a CO2-neutral, abundant, and renewable substitute for fossil fuels.

The most obvious difference between the four spectra is the lower intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra of the cell on the soft PA gel attached to the custom substrate. Because this feature is absent in the spectra of the stiff PA gel on a custom substrate, it is not likely due to either the custom substrate itself or to differences in the reagents used to attach the photopolymerized and thermally polymerized gels to the custom substrate and commercial substrate, respectively. Instead, we attribute the low intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra acquired from the soft PA gel on the custom substrate to a low degree of polymerization within this gel. This interpretation is supported by our observation that the intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 increases with the UV exposure time (Figure .b), and prior reports that assign the spectral peaks at 830-850 cm -1 to polyacrylamide .Comparison of the average spectra acquired from cells on each combination of PA gel stiffness and substrate (Figure .b) reveals the spectra acquired from both the custom substrate and the commercially available (Thorlabs) substrate are roughly comparable. However, the average spectra from CHO cells on the custom substrate have higher standard deviation.Because photopolymerization produces gels with a larger range of stiffness than thermal polymerization, this higher variance is due to the use of photopolymerization to create the PA gels on the custom substrates and thermal polymerization to create the PA gels on the substrates purchased from Thorlabs.  \nQuestion:\n What is the most obvious difference between the four spectra?"}]}

Bespoke charges are usually assumed to be compatible with the fixed Lennard-Jones parameters of the force field, although these themselves have also been shown to be dependent on the local environment of the atom. Although proteins must also experience polarization effects in both the charges and Lennard-Jones parameters, protein force field parameters have always, to date, been assigned from a transferable library. This leads to an inconsistency in the parametrization strategy used for protein force fields and bespoke small molecule force fields. This is potentially problematic when studying properties that depend on the electrostatic potentials of proteins, such as their interactions with small molecules, and there is no clear way around this using traditional force field fitting methods.To improve the consistency between charge and Lennard-Jones parameters, and also reduce the reliance on fitting to experimental data, one could either directly fit non-bonded MM parameters to reproduce quantum mechanical (QM) energies and forces, or derive the non-bonded parameters of the force field directly from QM.

However, the energy difference between 1 and 2 was not significant enough to ensure exclusive formation of the latter, thus reinforcing the results illustrated in Scheme 4. DFT calculations revealed that \"ring-walking\" of 1 en route to 2 might occur via 1,2-hydride shift via an energetically-favorable transition state TS1 (26.9 kcal\u2022mol -1 ) in which C-H bond-cleavage is enabled by formation of a Ni-H bond. Interestingly, the shifting hydrogen atom is shared by the two Ni centers at unsymmetrical distances of 1.5 and 1.9 \u00c5 and by the C2 carbon atom (1.6 \u00c5). An otherwise similar TS2 was located by starting with 2 as precursor instead with an activation barrier of 22.9 kcal\u2022mol -1 . Putting these results into perspective, the 1,2-hydride shift might not occur directly from carbon to carbon, but rather in a two-step process via the intermediacy of Int-1 possessing a \u00b5-hydride bridge between the two Ni centers. Unfortunately, all our attempts at either isolating Int-1 or detect the formation of the highly shielded bridging \u00b5-hydride by NMR spectroscopy were unsuccessful, suggesting that these species might not be particularly stable in solution. This notion gains credence by the kinetically instability found for Int-1, possessing a higher energy when compared to both 1 and 2 (>17.0 kcal\u2022mol -1 ), thus precluding its isolation or detection by conventional analytical techniques. The results compiled in Schemes 4 and 5 suggest that a nickel translocation throughout the arene backbone might hold promise to establish a new rationale for enabling C-C bond formations of aryl pivalates at remote C(sp 2 )-H sites.

The corresponding procedure requires systematically and smoothly improving CE quality in each iteration. In practice, the required number of iterations is very molecule specific but convergence is typically achieved within 5-15 iterations (see Fig. for some examples). The entropy difference between the last iteration and the extrapolated value is often relatively small but very significant for very flexible systems with huge ensembles. For example the CE of n-octadecane contains over half a million conformers within 6 kcal mol -1 at the last iteration. In a more typical case the entropy gain due to the extrapolation is smaller than one entropy unit (1 cal mol -1 K -1 ). Apixaban and Tamiflu depicted in Fig. are such examples, but nonetheless exhibit different convergence behavior. For small molecules the extrapolation is mostly not necessary because the entire ensemble will be found during the initial sampling procedure.

Note, that 3 cal mol -1 K -1\"entropy units\" refer to the usual 1 kcal mol -1 chemical accuracy at room temperature.Thus, with an accuracy for S better than about 1-2 cal mol -1 K -1 , the electronic energies of the molecules from DFT or wave function theory (WFT) become the accuracy bottleneck in typical thermochemical calculations. \nQuestion:\n What is often relatively small but very significant for very flexible systems with huge ensembles?"}]}

At both concentrations, a ground-state bleach (GSB) is observed at \u223c650 nm, and a small amount of stimulated emission (SE) at \u223c720 nm. For the the 0.05 mM TIPS-Pn solution (Fig. (a)), there are additional excited-state absorption (ESA) signals centered at approximately 453, 514, and 572 nm, which are consistent with previous observations of the absorption of the TIPS-Pn singlet exciton. The spectrum of the 0.05 mM TIPS-Pn solution appears to maintain its shape over time. Figure 1(b) shows the averaged spectrum over early times (50-150 ps), and late times (7500-8000 ps), normalized to the GSB. The shape is essentially identical for both time windows, suggesting that predominantly singlet excitons are present over the full 8 ns window, and there is insignificant triplet formation. The kinetics at all wavelengths fit well to a single exponential decay with a lifetime of 18.1 \u00b1 0.2 ns (Fig. and Sec. S4.1 of the supplementary material). A small deviation is present at very early times (<50 ps), which we attribute to solvent reorganization. 17 Previously reported lifetimes of TIPS-Pn singlet excitons vary from around 12 to 22 ns, with this range of values likely due to the presence of additional deactivation pathways in some of these measurements through reactions with oxygen.  \nQuestion:\n Why do the previously reported lifetimes of TIPS-Pn singlet excitons vary?"}]}

This data confirmed the presumed structures in all cases: in each of the four structures the hypercoordinate silicon core adopts an octahedral structure with the two silyloxy ligands observed in a trans (diaxial) arrangement (Figure ). The asymmetric unit in 1i contains two molecules, each in a different conformational pose (1i\u2032 and 1i\u2032\u2032).Of the four compounds we examined (seen in Table ), all deviated from planarity. Compound 1g is the most planar molecule with two meso carbon atoms located trans to each other displaced above and below the plane by \u00b10.011 \u00c5. This is the most planar porphyrin silane crystal structure reported to date. The meso carbons in 1h and in both poses of 1i were each out of plane, though only slightly (\u22640.152 \u00c5), and porphyrins maintained overall symmetry around the central silicon. Unique amongst the studied set, compound 1f displayed the least planar structure and was surprisingly devoid of symmetry around the central silicon atom. In general, we were gratified to see that modification of the easily incorporated axial silyloxy substituents can control the degree to which the porphyrin deviates from planarity in the crystal structure. This demonstrates that axial substitution is a powerful tool for control of solid-state porphyrin conformation.In terms of electronics, the iterative replacement of methyl for phenyl groups on the silyloxy cap (1f to 1g to 1i) should increase the electron density on the silane allowing for lengthening of the O1-Si2/O2-Si3 bond (Figure ); the excess electron density on the oxygen could translate to a shorter Si1-O distances and allow the Si-N bonds to lengthen to accommodate the preferred return to planarity of the ring.

The HOMO\u2192LUMO dipole transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and therefore the LUMO energy does not control the optical band gap. (It should be noted that the HOMO\u2192LUMO transition might still be responsible for a very weak signal at about 1.8 eV as shown in Figure in the SI, which is neglected for the following calculations.) For pyrene, the HOMO\u2192LUMO transition is allowed and determines the optical band gap. If the difference between the optical band gap and the electronic band gap is to be calculated in a meaningful manner using electronic \"frozen orbital\" transition energies, the LUMO has to be excluded for azupyrene. Accordingly, the DFT-calculated electronic band gap of azupyrene increases from 2.96 eV to 3.62 eV. With this value the difference between the DFT-based \"frozen orbital\" electronic band gap and the (experimental) optical band gap is 1.08 eV (= 3.62 eV -2.54 eV) for azupyrene, while the same difference is only 0.20 eV (= 3.83 eV -3.63 eV) for pyrene. The large deviation between the electronic and optical band gap for azupyrene is a direct consequence of its nonalternant \uf070-electron system. This topological property of azupyrene leads to a localization of the molecular orbitals. When an electron is excited into a higher lying orbital, then its initial and final orbitals can be located in different parts of the molecule, thus decreasing electron-electron repulsion in the excited state and lowering the transition energy. This explanation was already used to explain the color of the prototypical nonalternant molecule azulene. \nQuestion:\n Why is there a large deviation between the electronic and optical band gap for azupyrene?"}]}

While each orientation of the molecule is equally likely to be present in the sample, leading to a Pake pattern of inter-spin coupling frequencies, the orientations do not contribute equally to the recorded data due to the inherent orientation selectivity of microwave pulses (Figure ). As such we can generate two models of dipolar coupling: one with uniform weights representing the sample as a whole, and one in which each orientation is weighted by the overlap of the nitroxide spectrum with the microwave pulses. The simulated fidelities of the entangling gate with \ud835\udf14 C = 2 MHz for the uniform and weighted models are 0.749 and 0.821, respectively, significantly lower than the corresponding simulations considering an isotropic interaction.

The uniformly weighted simulation is more impacted by this interference as its frequency distribution is a complete Pake pattern, whereas the frequency distribution of the spectrally weighted simulation corresponds to a partial Pake pattern.In addition to the orientational disorder, molecules in frozen solution will adopt different conformations with different inter-spin distances.

While this approach is computationally facile and generally converges in only a few iterations, it does not account for the curvature of the space of valid internal coordinates, which results in poor quality displacements when using highly redundant coordinate systems, for example for molecules with rings. We have previously developed an alternate approach for realizing displacements in redundant internal coordinate systems based on geodesics of the curved internal coordinate manifold. This geodesic approach accounts for the correlation between internal coordinates not only at the endpoints of the displacement, but also throughout the entire displacement trajectory. We have shown that this geodesic displacement strategy dramatically reduces the number of steps required to reach convergence in a minimization algorithm as compared to the traditional Newton displacement method. Following each geometry optimization step, the approximate Hessian is updated using the geodesic secant update, which is also described in our previous work. As mentioned previously, the parameter \u03b1 in equation 28 (for minimization) and equations 29 and 30 (for saddle point optimization) is chosen to satisfy a trust region condition.

By sacrificing atomic-level details, these models can capture the essential interactions and dynamics that drive amyloid aggregation. This facilitates the discovery of assembly mechanisms and provides insight into the structure and stability of amyloid fibrils. In contrast to particle-based simulations, these simulations capture essential interactions and dynamics for non-covalent bond formation and breakage between aggregating proteins by direct dynamical modeling of graph structures. This approach of directly modeling network dynamics allows for exploration of timescales and larger system sizes many orders of magnitude larger than what is tractable using particle-based methods. Model parameterization is validated such that models are able to reliably reproduce experimentally measured mature fibril structures as an emergent phenomenon. Network Hamiltonian simulations can offer valuable insights into the thermodynamics, kinetics, and structural transitions involved in amyloid fibril assembly, which can aid in identifying targets for the design of potential therapeutic strategies; however, substantial technical challenges are inherent to parameter selection, as the parameter space is fraught with discontinuities and nonlinearities .

An example of the Gray code quantum circuit that generates the qubit state of Eq. ( ) is shown in Fig.1. The process of populating a desired quantum state starts with the transformation of the initial qubit state |0\u27e9 \u2297 n into N -particle subspace, where n and N correspond to the number of qubits and particles in the system of interest, respectively. Next, one designs unitary operators using the Gray code decomposition as shown in the example quantum circuit of particles with respect to the reference qubit state.

The Gray code for the single unitary operation is completed by the same 2M -1 multi-qubit controlled-NOT gates, but in the reversed order.

The difference between the shape of the experimental and modeled spectra (Fig. )), shows a negative trend as a function of time that is centered at 504 nm. This result confirms that the amount of T 1 predicted here using the upper bound for the ISC rate constant that we have determined is an overestimate, and thus the true ISC rate constant is lower than this value.The upper bound of k ISC for TIPS-Pn is greater than the pseudo-first-order SF rate constant (k SF [S 0 ]) up to a concentration of 1.45 mM, where k ISC and k SF [S 0 ] are equal. Based on the kinetic model and these rate constants, at 8 mM, ISC could account for up to 10% of triplets formed after 8 ns. So the assumption of negligible ISC made when fitting the bimolecular SF rate above is potentially invalid. We therefore refit the model with k ISC equal to 3.08 \u00d7 10 6 s -1 and found that for this level of ISC, k SF fits to lower range of (2.5 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 9 M -1 s -1 (compared to (2.7 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 9 M -1 s -1 for no ISC) (Table ).

Optimal results were achieved with a catalyst concentration of 300 mg/L, as higher dosages led to reduced efficiency due to particle agglomeration and decreased light access to active sites.Higher initial dye concentrations also resulted in reduced removal rates due to increased competition for reactive radicals.

However, when F -ion was added into this system, the fluorescence of JUC-557-nanosheet with Fe 3+ was remarkably enhanced (up to 38%), which could be attributed to the formation of a stable coordination complex, FeF 6 3-.

Furthermore, the Young's modulus, reflected by the linear slope of the stress-strain curve, is also larger for H4FBCDC. The demonstrated strain resistance behavior shows that the intended linker is more rigid than the DUT-49 linker, which follows chemical intuition based on comparison of the chemical structures.These simulations also demonstrate the overall deflection for the H4BBCDC is larger than for H4FBCDC. The pore sizes of the related op-phases of corresponding MOFs do not differ significantly, as shown in the supplementary information section 3.3.7. The performance of an NGA material cannot be directly derived from the stress strain curve, however, the increased rigidity of H4FBCDC is expected to permit a overloading of the metastable state, increasing the NGA step.

In traditional transferable force fields, every atom in a molecule is assigned a type based on its atomic number, bonding and local chemical environment. The atom type then dictates the parameters that are used to model that atom's interactions. The force field parameters for each atom type are stored as a library, which is built by carefully reproducing the experimental or quantum mechanical properties of a benchmark set of small molecules. Due to the infeasibility of accurately parameterizing all of chemical space, a balance must be made between the size of the library and potential inaccuracy due to transferring parameters to molecules outside the fitting set. In many cases, it is acknowledged that transferable force fields are not sufficiently accurate. When building force fields for small molecules, the atomic charges are usually assigned in a system-specific or \"bespoke\" manner, using methods such as RESP, CM1, or AM1-BCC. This is because it is well-known that atomic charges polarize in response to their chemical environment (for example, the presence of electron \nQuestion:\n Why are atomic charges usually assigned in a system-specific or 'bespoke' manner when building force fields for small molecules?"}]}

This timescale deficit of roughly 9 orders of magnitude presents a major challenge in the design of computer simulation methods for studying protein aggregation events. Thus, coarse-grained molecular simulations of amyloid fibril formation are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism behind the formation of these structures, which are implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Type II diabetes. Network Hamiltonian simulations of aggregation are centered around a Hamiltonian function that returns the total energy of a system of aggregating proteins, given the graph structure of the system as input. In the graph, or network, representation of the system, each protein molecule is represented as a node, and noncovalent bonds between proteins are represented as edges. The parameter, i.e. a set of coefficients that determine the degree to which each topological degree of freedom is favored or disfavored, must be determined for each network Hamiltonian model, and is a well-known technical challenge. Here, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) called a genetic algorithm is introduced for autonomously parameterizing network Hamiltonian models, whereby an initial set of randomly parameterized models, typically of low fibril yield (e.g. < 5 %), is used to initiate the evolution of subsequent model generations, ultimately leading to high fibril yield models (e.g. > 70 %). The methodology is also demonstrated by applying it to optimizing previously published network Hamiltonian models for the 5 key amyloid fibril topologies that have been reported in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and showing that the models generated by the AI produce fibril yields that surpass or \nQuestion:\n Why are coarse-grained molecular simulations crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism behind the formation of amyloid fibrils?"}]}

Such extremely large flexible systems have not been considered before quantitatively.The experimental entropy values show a strict linear increase with the number of carbon atoms and the reproduction of this relation represents a challenging task for theoretical methods. Both the RRHO as well as the msRRHO models increasingly underestimate the entropy with growing system size leading to a strongly non-linear behavior and errors of more than 20% for the largest alkanes considered.

The global minimum of C 14 H 30 and of smaller n-alkanes in the gas-phase always correspond to a linear (unfolded) structure. As intramolecular interactions, in particular London dispersion, become stronger with increasing system size, other conformers will be favored eventually. For C 14 H 30 up to C 18 H 38 , a competing folded conformer (in which dispersion interactions are maximized) is observed. The folded conformers are energetically similar to the respective linear structure but differ strongly in their msRRHO entropy.

Both of these reaction platforms provide an operationally-simple method for preparing and using NHI biocatalysts in a manner that is amenable to preparative-scale reactions, avoiding arduous protein purification steps. Analytical-scale reactions revealed that CitB and ClaD each selectively hydroxylate compounds with a variety of steric and electronic properties (Fig. ). Introducing bulky, electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at either the C5 or C6 position did not prevent productive reactions with CitB. However, ClaD demonstrated limitations in its ability to accept larger groups, such as phenyl substituents at C5 and C6. The complementarity of substrate scopes between CitB and ClaD is also observed in the substitution at C4. For CitB, the formyl group at C4 can be substituted with alternative electronwithdrawing substituents such as a nitro group (25) or imine (24). However, substrates with greater steric bulk at C4, such as ketone substrates, were generally not hydroxylated by CitB. In contrast, ClaD can productively react with a variety of ketones (see 9, 27-30). The importance of this C4 substituent is also highlighted by the lack of reaction observed with 2,5-dimethylresorcinol (23).

These compounds, mainly perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanoic sulfonic acid (PFOS), are common in industry as synthetic surfactants for the synthesis of polymer materials used in carpeting, upholstery, apparel, floor wax, textiles, firefighting foams, and sealants. Despite their ubiquity, PFAS have shown to be extremely persistent in the environment. Their slow degradability has led to an overwhelming abundance in the soil, dust, air, and groundwater.Unfortunately, these compounds have also been identified as carcinogens, among many other health effects, making them a global health threat. The detection and efficient removal of PFAS has thus become an important topic in recent years as these \"forever chemicals\" continue to be found in daily-use products and drinking water sources. These environmental factors coupled with the unique physical and chemical properties of PFAS require novel materials and sensing platforms for rapid and sensitive detection of these pernicious compounds.The typical strategy for sensitively detecting chemicals is to use high surface-area materials. In this context, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive materials family as they provide a rich library of systems with high surface area, intrinsic porosity, and high molecular adsorptivity. They have been extensively studied for a variety of applications ranging from catalysis, energy storage, chemical capture, as well as sensing. <ref \nQuestion:\n Why are PFAS considered a global health threat?"}]}

These reactions include cyclizations, cross couplings, amine and olefin functionalizations and are routinely used in the synthesis of pharmacophores and drug-like molecules. Typically, photoredox catalysis is driven by either energy transfer (EnT) or photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the photocatalyst and a quencher which forms a reactive radical or ionic species that initiates the desired reactivity. The mechanism for PET occurs in one of two ways: (i) Reductive quenching, whereby the photocatalyst is quenched through acceptance of an electron from a reductant, or (ii) oxidative quenching, whereby the photocatalyst donates an electron to an oxidant (Figure ). The quenching agent may be an integrated component of the transformation, such as one of the organic substrates or a co-catalyst, or a sacrificial quencher that serves to convert the photocatalyst to a species that can oxidize or reduce the organic substrate, such as O2 or alkyl amines. Shedding light on quenching steps within a photoredox reaction is crucial to gain mechanistic insights <ref type=\"bibr\" \nQuestion:\n Why does photoredox catalysis involve mechanisms such as reductive and oxidative quenching?"}]}

This is particularly relevant for gaseous fuels such as natural gas, where large-scale storage requires large volumes that can only be found underground. Storage of energy carriers is vital to the social acceptance, immediate implementation, and economy inclusion. It is also the primary method of coping with the fluctuations in supply and demand. One of the causes of the spike in the natural gas price at the end of 2021 was indeed the depletion of the European gas reservoirs that were put under stress by the decreased natural gas supply from abroad, namely Russia.Underground storage of hydrogen can be done in a similar fashion as the underground storage of natural gas i.e., in salt caverns. Salt caverns are synthetic subsurface structures that are developed by 'washing' away salt from an underground salt deposit until a hollow structure is formed. Salt caverns offer the most promising underground storage option due to the large sealing capacity of rock salt, its inert nature, as well as their flexibility toward injection/withdrawal cycles. Although salt deposits are not commonplaces in the world, they are not particularly rare, either: there is a significant amount of salt deposits spread throughout Europe (Figure ). It is estimated that the total on-and off-shore European hydrogen storage potential is 84.8 PWhH2, which represents more than 8 times of the total final energy consumption in Europe in 2020. This reinforces the potential to store significant amounts of H2 in Europe, enough to cover a potential surge in demand in the coming decades.The investigation of underground \nQuestion:\n What is the estimated total on-and off-shore European hydrogen storage potential?"}]}

Re-admission of CO at room temperature restores the CO band on alumina clusters but does not affect the 2252 cm -1 band (Fig. ). Further, introduction of NO on this sample does not lead to displacement of CO (Fig. ), indicative of Al(III) sites which do not form stable NO complexes, but can coordinate CO.Upon introduction of water vapor in the IR cell at room temperature on the 650 \u2070C dehydrated samples, then we heated the sample under high vacuum at 450 \u2070C, no CO adsorption band was observed at 2252 cm -1 but CO signatures on EFAL (alumina clusters) were observed (Fig. ).We then heated the sample at 650 \u2070C in the IR cell, adsorbed CO at room temperature which led to the formation of the 2252 cm -1 band (Fig. ). This confirms that Al cation strongly coordinates water under ambient conditions or at slightly elevated temperatures as the zeolite is thermally dehydrated and that high temperatures are required to reversibly dehydrate this Al species.

As the fitted lines follow the calculated populations closely, the proposed reaction networks are sufficient to describe the excited-state dynamics, despite some trajectories exhibiting more complex decay processes (see Section S5). The time constants from the exponential fits are reported in Section S6, which also includes a more detailed discussion on how the mechanisms were established.The mechanism of the excited-state dynamics of VCl 3 (ddpd) has been discussed in Section 2.1. In short, intersystem crossing from the 3 T 1 ' states (dark blue line) populates singlet states (violet line) which reach a maximum population of 43% at ca. 4 ps. Afterwards, the singlet population falls again due to intersystem crossing to the 3 T 2 states (green line) from where the population relaxes to the 3 T 1 ground states (red line). Not all population leaves the singlet states, however, as we find a singlet population of ca. 9% after 100 ps that can be available for phosphorescence. Similar to VCl 3 (ddpd), we find pronounced intersystem crossing that populates the singlet states in all four newly designed complexes. During the simulations each singlet population reaches at least 41%, the largest one being 54% in the case of [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, see Figure . All singlet population maxima are found within the first 5 ps simulation times. At later simulation times all singlet populations drop to lower values, however, leading to two different outcomes among the four complexes.For [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and VCl 3 (im-im-im), the singlet population drops to values around 1% already on a 20 ps time scale, making them less promising candidates for 3d-luminophores.

Moreover, as shown in our earlier work, we have also observed a background-triggered process where exponential amplification occurred without the presence of an initial template (DNA-I) (open circles, Figure ). This process is attributed to a pseudo-blunt end ligation of the four fragments in the absence of any DNA-I templates. This ligation is not a true blunt end ligation, performed facilely by T4 DNA ligase, as the duplex that results from hybridization of Ia and IIaP has a 5'-phosphate abasic nucleotide, which should not interact with the 5'-phosphate deoxyadenosine single-base overhang from the IbP:Iib fragment duplex, hence our use of the term pseudo-blunt end.
