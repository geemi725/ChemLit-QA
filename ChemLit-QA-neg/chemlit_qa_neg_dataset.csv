"Digging out the molecular connections between the active site of human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase and its pathophysiology Human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase (hLAMAN) is a paradigmatic example of how few missense mutations can critically affect normal catabolism in the lysosome and cause the severe condition named alphamannosidosis. Here we have made use of computational chemistry methods to unveil the molecular basis of 4 missense mutations in hLAMAN with pathological consequences. We have simulated for the first time the all-atom catalytic reaction mechanism of hLAMAN by means of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics metadynamics.Second, we show how the catalytically inactive variant D74E presents a significant increase of the free energy barrier.

Our findings open up new opportunities for treatment of mannosidosis.Human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase (LAMAN, EC 3.2.1.24) belongs to the Zn 2+ -dependent aspartic glycosidase hydrolase family GH38. hLAMAN catalyzes the cleavage of end-terminal mannosidic linkages Œ±(1‚Üí2), Œ±(1‚Üí3), and Œ±(1‚Üí6) from glycoproteins (Figure ). hLAMAN has a large globular domain (962 amino acids) with the active site centered in the helix core (Figure ). The total or partial loss of this enzyme activity by missense mutations is behind the diagnosis of the rare genetic disorder alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA). MANSA is grouped with other lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), and, although it has a very low incidence (1 out of 500,000), this number could increase because of undiagnosed patients. MANSA is characterized by several symptoms as intellectual disability, unusual facial features, or skeletal anomalies, amongst others. Despite the remarkable severity of some of the symptoms in MANSA, there is no permanent cure yet.

Overall, these changes in the Zn 2+ -coordination sphere and in the puckering of the reactant end up in significant increase in the energy barrier of the catalyzed reaction by the D74E variant. Furthermore, we wanted to look for other mutations on hLAMAN that may affect the conformation of the active site. To do this, we computed bond-to-bond propensities in the wild-type hLAMAN using the server ProteinLens to detect distal regions in the enzyme connected with the movement of the active site. In Figure and Table , we highlight the 50 residues identified to have a significant correlation with the active site within a 95 % quantile score. Interestingly, the algorithm detected two out of 26 known sequence positions related to catalytically-deficient hLAMAN variants: D159 and E402.Mutations in these positions drive to inactive variants (D159N and E402K) that, although they can fold and reach the lysosome, cannot process oligosaccharides. Visual inspection of our atomic model for wild-type hLAMAN indicates that the change D \uf0ae N on position 159 (at 10 √Ö from the active site) will prevent the dual interaction of the aspartic carboxylate with the amide hydrogens of A161 and A162 in the enzyme variant (Figure ). More critical is the change in position 402, where the introduction of a lysine residue in the position of a glutamic acid creates an electrostatic repulsion with the R403 amidinium group (located on the same helix) and a change in the orientation of the side chain of Q444, residue located close to one of', 'violin plots. No significant differences were found between the three systems. The variant R229W shows a slightly larger hydrophobic SASA component (+1 nm 2 ) and lower hydrophilic SASA (-0.4 nm 2 ) when compared with the wild-type enzyme (Table ), but no major conformational changes were detected in the two mutated systems (Figures and). Thus, our computational data confirm that the mutation R229W does not change the hydrophilic patterning of the surface or the total conformation of the protein, but rather modifies the network of interactions of the active site with its first sphere environment (F377).On the one hand, we have found that the Zn 2+ -dependent hLAMAN follows an E5 \uf0ae 4 H5/ 1 S5 \uf0ae 1 S5 conformational itinerary, similar to the one observed in the Ca 2+ -dependent GH92 Œ±-mannosidase. On the other hand, overall, in this work we have used different computational approaches to understand at the atomic level the impact that several mutations have on the biological role of hLAMAN. We have shed light on the molecular basis of the pathophysiology of 4 missense mutations in LAMAN. D74E shows a larger energy barrier, D159N and E402K may affect the conformation at the active site, and R229Wdoes not impact the SASA distribution in hLAMAN and its effect should be connected with the chemical dynamics of the active site. Overall, our findings open up new avenues for targeting hLAMAN with new tools that can be used for the screening of small organic molecules with the aim of modulating its enzyme activity. Further studies are ongoing within our research group.Figure 1 .1Figure 1. (A) Example of targeted oligosaccharides by hLAMAN at the lysosome.

In MANSA, more than 130 pathogenic variants have been detected from which 54 are point mutations described to alter the normal intracellular processing and/or the 3D structure of the enzyme. As an example, the frequent R750W mutation (in more than 20% of MANSA patients) prevents the correct folding of the enzyme, and mutations like D74E, H200L or H200N alter totally the coordination sphere of the metal ion at the active site. Interestingly, out of these 54 mutations, 26 are known to have a significant loss of enzymatic activity (Table ). However, the molecular features that are responsible for preventing a full alpha-mannosidase activity still remain elusive. First, the absence of experimental structural models on hLAMAN undermines the development of fundamental knowledge of the molecular specifics behind these disabling mutations, and second, no all-atom catalytic reaction mechanism has been reported so far for this enzyme. In this work, we address these two challenges in order to unravel the structural features that connect enzyme activity and some of these disabling mutations. We first generated an all-atom molecular model for hLAMAN using the deep-learning structure from AlphaFold2 (Figure ). hLAMAN shows a very large sequence identity and structural similarity with both bovine LAMAN (bLAMAN, PDB id. 1O7D) and Drosophila melanogaster Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (GM-II, PDB id.', 'LAMAN (bLAMAN, PDB id. 1O7D) and Drosophila melanogaster Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (GM-II, PDB id. 3CZN) (see Figure and Section S1). The confidence obtained for the deeplearning model was extremely high for almost all residues in the structure of hLAMAN with exception of the N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-49), which was thus removed in our simulations. We placed the substrate \uf061-D-mannopyranose-(1-6)-\uf062-D-mannopyranose (BMA) at the active site and ran classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the \uf06ds-time scale to equilibrate, solvate and refine this complex (see Section S2). We applied distance restraints to preserve the key interactions for catalysis between the substrate BMA and both Asp196 and Asp319 residues. After equilibration, we gradually removed these constraints until we got a unrestrained system. As an outcome, we selected one snapshot of the final equilibrated system and ran quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics during 170 ps (Figure and Sections S3-S). The QM region definition included the coordination sphere of Zn 2+ (Asp196, Asp74, His72, and His445 side chains starting from the \uf062-carbon), the BMA substrate, and the side chain of the acid/base catalytic Asp319 (87 atoms in total, Figure ). We treated the QM region with the semiempirical tight-binding density functional theory DFTB3. Before simulating the enzyme-catalyzed reaction mechanism, we screened the puckering of the ring at the subsite -1 (-1 ring) in BMA for the enzyme-reactant (ER) complex (Figure and Section S3).

The black lines represent the 95% confidence intervals.', ""IntroductionQuantitative structure-activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) methods depend on the transformation of molecules' structures to numbers. Molecular descriptors are applied to conduct the transformation of chemicals to numerical representation. There are a lot of different molecular descriptors -some of them attempt to encode properties of the compound, others try to catch the complexity of the molecule etc. There are also molecular descriptors that rely on fragments of molecules eg. extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP), atom pairs and topological torsion descriptors. In many cases, these types of descriptors transform molecules into vectors of the same length of either zeros or ones -called bits or vectors of the counts of each molecular fragment.The application of molecular descriptors is not limited only to QSAR/QSPR but also to the determination of similarity of molecules. The descriptors of continuous values may be gathered into a vector and the similarity as a Euclidean distance between two molecules can be computed. The bits representation vectors are the basis for calculating similarity coefficients, like the Tanimoto index.Since the introduction by Carhart et. al., the idea of atom pairs has been modified several times and applied to build various models. In this research novel molecular descriptors, yet another modification of atom pairs, is proposed and examined in QSAR and"", 'Quantum informed atom pairsTo enrich atom pairs with quantum-chemical properties, 1089 unique atom pairs of distance of up to 4 bonds were generated from QM9-extended-plus database. Based on the set of unique atom pairs, two different approaches to define quantum atom pairs (QAP) were undertaken.In the first definition, every atom pair was assigned with arithmetic means of quantum properties of all molecules containing the atom pair. In the case of multiple occurrences of an atom pair in the molecule, the property value was divided by the number of occurrences.Since there are 11 quantum properties in the quantum properties database, every atom pair was related with 11 values.The alternative definition was to generate 10 binned histograms out of the values of quantum properties of molecules containing specific atom pair, divided by the number of occurrences of the atom pair. As a result, 110 different values were assigned to atom pairs. The nature of modified atom pairs makes them highly dependent on the composition of the quantum properties database which impacts the applicability domain of QAP. Due to the narrow group of elements present in the QM9-extended-plus database, atom pairs are limited to C, O, N, F, S, Cl, and Br elements. The limitation transfers to the applicability domain. In the research molecules containing only atom pairs from the set generated from the QM9-extended-plus database were curated from experimental databases.From the aforementioned QAPs, three sets of molecular descriptors were generated: ', ""Results and discussionThe results indicate that in most cases QAPs provide enough information to yield predictions more accurate than the baseline. Among designed QAPs, spQAPs proved to be the most informative, thus this type of representation was investigated the most. It appears that in some cases enriching atom pairs with information derived from quantum chemistry improves the accuracy of the models relative to traditional atom pairs.Considering regression tasks, based on figures 1 and 2 representing R 2 and RMSE respectively, the overall impression is that the best models' performance is achieved with molecular descriptors, then spQAP and then unmodified atom pairs. Only in the case of predicting pIC50, the most informative molecular representation were atom pairs. Another exception was ionization energy, as Morgan fingerprints and RDKit fingerprints were better suited to create structure-property relationships.In order to gain more insight into the differences in metrics obtained with spQAP and atom pairs, the relative metrics were calculated as the ratio of metric value obtained with spQAP to the value obtained with atom pairs minus 1. The ratio was calculated for each cross validation fold and visualized in figures 3 and 4. The quantum modification of atom pairs caused an average value of R 2 increase from 0.5% to 6% and the RMSE decreased about 0.5% to 5% depending on the predicted property. In the case of predicting pIC50, the average decrease of R 2 was 2% and the RMSE increased by about 3%. tors and RDKit fingerprints. The phenomenon may result from the imbalanced nature of the BBBP and ClinTox datasets. Although ROC AUC is widely used in evaluating classifiers, there are reports that it may be misleading when the dataset is imbalanced. To complement the results, an U Mann-Whithney test was applied to assess whether the results of metrics vary"", 'Towards quantum informed atom pairs In the following research, a new modification of traditional atom pairs is studied.The atom pairs are enriched with values originating from quantum chemistry calculations.

Root mean squared error, R 2 , the area under the receiver operation curve and balanced accuracy are used to evaluate the predictive power of applied molecular representations.

Mendeleev, in his second 1869 publication about the system, discussed the pros and cons of selecting other properties as ordering criterion, e.g. electrochemical properties, relative affinities and valency . Mendeleev settled on atomic weight, mainly based upon its invariability across all substances containing a particular element. Compounds were central for atomic weight determinations, which resulted from finding the smallest common weight of a large set of compounds containing the reference element. Similarity among elements was addressed through chemical resemblance, which for Meyer was captured through common valency in compounds. Mendeleev commented upon physical properties such as optical, electrical or magnetic ones and vapour densities , but discarded them for their variability over compounds of the same element. He was after a property related to the essential presence of an element in its compounds, which moved him to analyse chemical properties such as acidity or alkalinity of oxides. However, they were ruled out because of the several amphoteric oxides. Mendeleev ended up taking substance composition as the proxy for similarity, which boils down to the valency, selected by Meyer. ""Thus the fluorine group contains elements which preferentially combine with a single atom of hydrogen, the oxygen group with two, the nitrogen group with three, and the carbon group with four atoms of hydrogen or chloride"" , Mendeleev claimed. Thus, compounds provided order and similarity to the system.', 'Diversity of the chemical space: combinations of elementsBy a combination we mean the elements present in a compound and arranged in lexicographic order, e.g. HOS for H 2 SO 4 . We found 3,022 combinations and analysed the distribution of their sizes (number of elements). Was the space populated with compounds of several elements? Or with substances of just few elements? For 60 elements, there are 1.15 √ó 10 18 possible combinations (Methods). We found that chemists reported compounds of few elements: from two up to eight. Moreover, about three quarters of the combinations were of three up to five elements (Figure ). The differences between experimental and theoretical number of combinations across the different sizes (Figure ), show that there was still plenty of opportunity to populate the space with new compounds within the observed range.To assess whether the space was also concentrated on some few combinations, we analysed the percentage of chemical space spanned by combinations weighted by their compounds (Figure ). The left hand side of the plot shows that combinations associated to one compound only, account for about 13% of the space. The right hand side shows the most frequent combinations: CHO and CHNO, which account for 8% and 7.5% of the space, respectively. We found that 37% of the combinations (1,120) account for 80% of the compounds and only 172 combinations spanned about half of the space. Strikingly, only 6% of the combinations gathered 50% of the reported substances. The top-20 of these combinations (Figure ) account for 30% of the space and their compositions show that the most populated combinations are based on organogenic elements including C, H, O, N, Cl, S, Br; which are among the elements with most compounds (Figure <ref', 'Er and Yb, which were separated one year later into the current Er, Ho and Tm; and Sc and a Yb, respectively . In 1907 the 1879 Yb was found to be a mixture of the current Lu and Yb . Moreover, there was confusion between erbium and terbium on the basis of their spectra and it is now known that Di, reported by Mendeleev as a chemical element, is a mixture of Pr and Nd. Therefore, we excluded Er, Yt and Di from our analysis and all the remaining study is based on our findings for the aforementioned 60 elements.To know the extent of the chemical space populated by the different elements, we counted the number of compounds containing each element (Figure ; Supplementary, Table ), where the enormous amount of O, H, C and N compounds is evident. Were O compounds absent, only 26% of the space would remain. If H substances were also removed, the available space would be 11.4%. By ignoring compounds containing O, H or C, the spanned space would be only 6% of that of 1869, which drops to 5% if N substances were disregarded. The importance of these organogenic elements contrasts with the percentage of space spanned if other quartets of elements were deleted. For example, removing halogen compounds would have much less dramatic effects, as 64% of the space would remain. Disregarding elements with few compounds such as Ta, Ce, Th and La would allow access to 96% of the space.Thus, the chemical space was rather unevenly explored by 1869, oxygen and hydrogen being the elements with most compounds. Chemists were aware of this, as Mendeleev wrote: ""The most widely distributed substances in nature possess the smallest atomic weights"" and ""The higher atomic weights belong to elements that are rarely encountered in nature, which do not form large deposits,', 'half of the formulae of 85% of the elements, they can be replaced by their most similar element. Hence, the chemical space by 1869 made most of the elements to be dissimilar from each other. In such a space of tiny similarities, chemists, nevertheless, were able to recognise several of them. Was it the result of chemical genius? Or a consequence of the organogenic bias of the space?To assess whether deep knowledge of the space was needed to gauge simi-larities among elements, or, on the contrary, whether partial knowledge sufficed to detect similarities, we took random samples of the formulae in the space of different sizes and analysed how often the similarities given by the whole formulae in the space (Figure ) were present in the samples (Methods). After analysing the 9,752 formulae spanning the space, we found that there are stable similarities, still evident in tiny portions of the space, e.g. Br‚ÜíCl, Na‚ÜíK, O‚ÜíS, Cl‚ÜíBr, S‚ÜíO, K‚ÜíNa, Se‚ÜíS, As‚ÜíP (shown at the top of Figure ). For example, Br‚ÜíCl is a similarity often observed with even 10% of the space (about 970 formulae). In contrast, similarities that are only evident by considering large portions of the formulae are Zn‚ÜíMg, Cs‚ÜíNa, Ca‚ÜíBa and those at the bottom of Figure . For instance, Ru‚ÜíMo only appears in more than half of the samples if the formulae analysed account for more than 95% of the known ones. Figure shows that most of the stable similarities occur for main group elements, while transition metal ones require deep knowledge of the space. This is a consequence of the small number of formulae associated to transition metals, formulae that are easily discarded by random sampling (Supplementary, Table ). Moreover, by taking less than half of the formulae (4,876), about the same proportion of similarities is obtained; mainly', 'including C, H, O, N, Cl, S, Br; which are among the elements with most compounds (Figure ). Notoriously, top-20 combinations are C and H based. The minor metallic span of the space is evident through the most populated metal combination: CHAgNO, which only gathers 0.8% of the space (Figure ). This is consistent with recent results on composition and growth of the chemical space .The number of combinations per element follows a similar trend to that of compounds per element shown in Figure (Supplementary, Figure ; Spearman correlation of 0.99). The question arising is on the ratio between the number of compounds and of combinations for each element. We calculated it (Figure , inset) and found that organogenic elements have much more compounds than combinations, when compared with other elements. C has six times more compounds than combinations and H, O and N, 4.6, 3.8 and 3.9, respectively. For La and Ta, each one of their combinations correspond to a single compound.We wondered whether compounds of an element are concentrated in few of its combinations or spread over them. Figure shows that organogenic elements concentrate most of their compounds in very few combinations: H, C, N and O gather three quarters of their compounds in about 1% of their combinations. This contrasts with the spread of other elements such as V and Au, which concentrate three quarters of their compounds in an ample range of combinations; 60% of V combinations and 67% of Au ones.To explore the role of C combinations and to contrast them with some non-C combinations, we analysed how often some molecular fragments appear over time in known substances.

It's worth mentioning that we have provided a dynamic computational strategy by combining ITS method and AIMD simulation for the temperature-dependent thermodynamics of CO diffusion on Ru(0001) surface. Although the enhanced sampling method indeed significantly improves the sampling efficiency, the computational cost is still awfully expensive for achieving a converged sampling.

Therefore, the most important aspect for using dynamic computational strategy in catalysis is to overcome the limitation of time scales in AIMD simulations. On one hand, proper enhanced sampling approaches could be introduced to allow an accelerated search in the phase space and thus fast thermodynamic properties evaluation. On the other hand, development of an efficient and accurate strategy to replace the direct ab initio calculations on system's energy and force is another approach to achieve a converged sampling more efficiently.Various enhanced sampling strategies have been developed so far for accelerating phase space sampling, including but not limited to the approaches of umbrella sampling (US), replica exchange, simulated tempering, transition path sampling, 21 metadynamics (MTD), adaptive biasing force, temperature accelerated molecular dynamics (TAMD), and integrated tempering sampling (ITS),"", 'As a favorable alternative and complement of experimental techniques, computational tools on top of ab initio calculations have played an indispensable role in revealing the molecular details, thermodynamics and kinetics in catalytic reactions.The static computational strategy, which recovers the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics based on the calculations of a few stationary geometries at zero temperature and some ideal statistic mechanics models, is the most popular approach in theoretical catalysis due to its simplicity. In comparison, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a well-tested approach to provide more precise descriptions of catalytic processes, however, experiencing a significantly expensive computational cost in the direct ab initio calculation of potential energy and gradients. Here we proposed a highly efficient dynamic computational strategy for the calculation of thermodynamic and kinetic properties in heterogeneous catalysis on the basis of neural network potential energy surface (NN PES) and MD simulations. Taking CO adsorbate on Ru(0001) surface as the illustrative model catalytic system, we demonstrated that our NN-PES-based MD simulations can efficiently generate the reliable smooth two-dimensional potentialof-mean-force (2-D PMF) surfaces in a wide range of temperatures (from 300 to 900 K), and thus temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties can be obtained in a comprehensive investigation on the whole PMF surface rather than a rough estimation using ideal models based on a few optimized geometries. Moreover, MD simulations offer an effective way to describe the surface kinetics such as the CO adsorbate onsurface movement, which goes beyond the most popular static estimation based on calculated free energy barrier and transition state theory (TST). By comparing the results obtained in the dynamic and static approaches, we further revealed that the dynamic strategy significantly', 'DiscussionIn the computational investigation on catalysis, the static computational strategy is the most common approach, in which the limited stationary states at zero temperature are localized and subsequently based on the partition functions of ideal models to obtain the thermodynamics at the realistic experimental conditions. Therefore, the reliability of static computational strategy depends on whether the ideal models are deviated from the realistic conditions. In comparison, MD simulations is a well-tested approach to obtain the thermodynamics as well as the kinetics of the target system by going beyond ideal models. The reliability of the dynamic computational strategy in statistical thermodynamics depends on whether the converged sampling can be achieved.The dynamic computational strategy based on AIMD simulations has been used to face some issues in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the expensive computational cost in AIMD simulations greatly limited its wide applications. The NN PES provides an accurate and efficient computational approach by avoiding most expensive ab initio calculations.

It could be argued, that all experimentally available information should be used in the fit, and that any associated decrease in the quality of the fit reflects the errors in either the ‚àÜB DFT e or the fit itself. We have considered this issue, and prefer to remain consistent with previous work. As mentioned above, the equilibrium structure of the OCS monomer is kept rigid and linear. The bond lengths of Morino and Matsumura 1are used for all r 0 and r SE e structures.Unlike in the previous work, the initial fit reported here takes into account all available isotopologue data. This structure is used as the r SE e in the following text. The BLYP functional predicts a 43 m√Ö longer separation.In the lightest two complexes, some of the DFAs yield negative frequencies when anharmonic corrections are applied to the (positive) harmonic frequencies. Two negative frequencies can be observed in the BLYP results for Ne‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS, one can be observed in both B2PLYP and B3LYP results for the He‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS complex. The weakly bound intermonomer mode is always one of those problematic degrees of freedom. For the Ne‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS complex the B2PLYP and B3LYP corrections are comparable and the r SE e structures differ by less than 3 m√Ö. However, the CCSD(T) results for the parent isotopologue are inconsistent with the DFT calculations.The story is similar in the He‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS complex. The B2PLYP-based r SE e follows the trend in bond lengths of the rare gas group, but the obtained angle is significantly different. On the other hand, the anharmonic frequencies obtained with BLYP do not have negative artefacts, and the angle in the BLYP structure of the He complex is more consistent with the rest of the dataset. However, the intermonomer separation obtained with BLYP is 3.7514(3) √Ö, which is longer than Kr‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS and therefore unrealistic.The CCSD(T) structure has an angle similar to the BLYP', ""B2PLYP e results and all other results is due to the significant underprediction of the centrifugal distortion constants: for instance, in the He‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ OCS complex, B2PLYP and second-order vibrational perturbation theory predict a D B2PLYP J of 79.05 kHz, while the experimental value is 438.63 kHz.Predicting accurate centrifugal distortion constants is a difficult task. In diatomics, the predicted D J 's from wavefunction theory (CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ) and density functional theory (B3LYP/augcc-pVTZ) are comparable, within 10% of experimental values. The agreement worsens significantly for the polyatomic CH 2 PCl: CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ results are within 25% of the experiment, while upon application of second-order vibrational perturbation theory, or single-hybrid DFAs, the deviation from experiment increases. Therefore, the disagreement between the binding energies from the supermolecular and Lennard-Jones approach reflects the innacurate D B2PLYP J as opposed to an invalidity of the Lennard-Jones model.The deformation energies for all complexes are negligible when compared to the overall binding energies. In the rare gas complexes, the OCS deformation energies are in the 1-3 J/mol range. For these complexes, the O-C-S angle bends towards the rare gas atom by at most 0.2 ‚Ä¢ . In the Hg‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS the deformation energy is slightly higher at 18 J/mol, and the O-C-S bend reaches 0.3 ‚Ä¢ . While it would seem that the deformation of the OCS monomer increases with increasing binding energy, this is not true for OCS complexes in general. The CS 2 ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢OCS complex has an interaction energy of ‚àº8 kJ/mol, but the OCS molecule is deformed by less than 0.1 ‚Ä¢ at a similar level of theory. The zero point energy differences show no particular trends, with the lowest difference calculated for Xe‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS (0.196 kJ/mol) and the highest for He‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS (0.442"", 'Table 2 :2Interaction (E int ) and binding (D E ) energies of the OCS complexes, in kJ/mol, calculated using SAPT, MP2+Œ¥(T), from literature.

The calculated MP2+Œ¥(T) binding energies D E are in a good agreement with the experimental values using the Lennard-Jones model for complexes up to Kr. This agreement breaks down with in heavier complexes likely due to relativistic effects. The minor disagreement in the interaction energies compared to previous CCSD(T) literature data can be explained by basis set incompleteness in the literature results. The deformation of the OCS monomer from its equilibrium structure upon complexation is predicted to be minimal, with the largest bend of 0.3 ‚Ä¢ predicted for Hg‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS. The mass-dependent r (2) m structures of the Xe and Ne complexes differ significantly from the r SE e structures. The bond lengths and angles in the OCS monomer are distorted in the r ([1,2]) m fits, especially the position of the O-atom. However, with the OCS monomer constrained to its equilibrium geometry, the mass-dependent structures are likely the most accurate structures ever obtained for the two complexes. The 43 m√Ö difference in the monomer separation in the MP2+Œ¥(T) and r (2) m structures can be partially explained by the lack of diffuse functions in the cc-pwcVnZ basis sets: upon augmentation the difference drops to 15 m√Ö. The closest agreement with the r (2) m structure could be obtained by adding the 4-th order relativistic correction (+Œ¥ 4 rel ) to the MP2+Œ¥(T) results, highlighting the importance of relativistic effects. However, this procedure cannot be generally recommended, as the scalar relativistic effects are double-counted. The inclusion of diffuse functions into at least 4-Œ∂ basis sets is a more systematic way of converging towards experimental structures.', 'Binding and interaction energiesThe overall binding energy of a complex (D E ) can be defined as the experimentally observable change in the energy upon binding of the monomers. Ignoring basis set and size consistency errors, it can be thought of as the difference of the zero-point corrected energy of the complex from the sum of the zero-point corrected energies of the relaxed monomers. Alternatively, it can be thought of as a sum of the interaction energy (E int ), the deformation energy (‚àÜE D ) and the change in the zero-point energy (‚àÜE ZPE ). The interaction energy is widely used as a benchmark quantity for computational methods, as calculating E int requires no geometry optimisation, but just a handful of single-point energy calculations.As a first look on the trends in the interaction energies in this set, we have applied the SAPT decomposition to the B2PLYP-based r SE e geometries.

The interaction with the rare gases is completely dispersion dominated, with electrostatic contribution increasing slightly down the group.

(b). A similar trend is observed at the anode as the cathode; namely, at lower current densities there is limited acoustic activity, indicating low bubble formation, which gradually increases as the areal current density is increased. If the number of hits recorded at the anode (Figure6(b)) is compared to the number of hits recorded under the same conditions at the cathode (Figure6(a)), fewer hits are observed at each current density, suggesting lower acoustic activity indicating lower bubble formation. These results correlate with the data obtained from voltage fluctuation experiments, which indicated that bubble formation was more prevalent at the cathode than the anode. Figure 6 .6Figure 6.

It is also observed that while there are hits just above the 25 dB threshold across the course of the experiment, increasing numbers of hits at higher acoustic amplitudes were observed as the current density increased.Notably, no acoustic activity is observed during any of the rest steps even at higher current densities, this indicated that the acoustic behavior is related to the operation of the electrolysis and not to any background effects. Tests were also repeated with the transducer in the same location but acoustically decoupled from the cell; no hits were detected during this test, ruling out any possible electromagnetic interference effects.This result suggests a change in behavior as the current density is increased, in line with the results observed from voltage fluctuation measurements. More acoustic activity is attributable to the formation of bubbles.The same experiment was repeated with the transducer placed on the anode of the electrolyser, these results are shown in Figure  In order to compare the acoustic activity at the anode and cathode at all current densities studied, the hit rate (number of hits per second) was calculated for all areal current values on both electrodes, the data from these calculations are shown in Figure range there is an increase in the rate of increase of acoustic hits per second with increasing current density, suggesting more bubble formation; this is a similar trend to that observed with the voltage fluctuation experiments.

At higher', 'that observed at the anode, indicating more prevalent bubble formation at the cathode. At higher current densities, above the 200-300 mA cm -2 range, this difference in acoustic activity increases further with a higher gradient observed with the cathode relative to the anode (Figure (a)). This again matches well with results obtained from voltage fluctuation experiments. This difference between the higher acoustic activity observed with the cathode relative to the anode, particularly at current densities above 200-300 mA cm -2 is more clearly observed by studying the cumulative energy of the acoustic hits (Figure (b)). Thus far, the focus has been on the number of hits recorded, which gives a good indication of the acoustic activity but does not include all information. By looking at the cumulative energy, this not only takes into account the total number of hits but other factors associated with each hit such as the duration and frequency of each hit. Based on the cumulative energy the performance of the two electrodes is relatively similar, albeit with the cathode showing slightly higher energy, until approximately 1500 s. At this point, where the current density is increased beyond 200 mA cm - prevalent at the cathode and for higher current densities above ca. 200 mA cm -2 the effect is initially larger on the cathode than the anode.', ""Electrolysis Cell using the Acoustic Emission TechniqueIn addition to the voltage fluctuation measurements, acoustic emission testing was employed to monitor bubble formation on the anode and cathode sides of the cell separately.Although this work was conducted on a cell with a slightly different layout, as outlined in Section 2.1.1, results from both set-ups were found to match closely (See Figure SI 5).The results obtained from acoustic emission testing are summarized in Figure . The use of the highly acoustically attenuating EPDM gasket between the two halves of the electrolyser allowed for the acoustic effects from each of the electrodes to be effectively isolated from one another. However, the crossover between electrodes was shown to be minimal.Constant current steps (60 s) of increasingly high areal current density were conducted with 120 s rests between each value. The acoustic emission was monitored across the course of the experiment. The results in Figure indicated that every time an acoustic event (a 'hit') was detected, it was above the chosen threshold value of 25 dB. The amplitude of each hit is indicated in each plot.For the cathode (Figure (a)) very few acoustic hits were observed at low current densities (e.g. Only two hits were observed across the 1 min, 10 mA cm -2 period), this is an indication of exceptionally low bubble formation with very limited acoustic activity. This trend for low amounts of bubble formation at low areal current densities continued across the first few current densities tested, although notably as the current density increased there was an increase in the number of hits occurring in each constant current step. After approximately 1500 s the number of acoustic hits increased more significantly. It is also observed"", ""ConclusionsIn this work, we have detected and analyzed the incidence of gas bubble formation during operation, of the cathode and anode of a high-performing capillary-fed water electrolysis cell.A voltage fluctuation and an acoustic emission technique were adapted and applied in combination, while applying current densities of up to 1 A cm -2 to the cell. Very similar resultswere obtained for the two techniques, with little bubble formation observed up to 0.17-0.20 A cm -2 . At higher current densities, up to around 0.6 A cm -2 , bubbles were formed predominantly at the cathode. Given that commercial alkaline electrolysers typically operate at current densities up to 0.6 A cm -2 , this suggests that minimizing bubble formation at the cathode offers the key opportunity for further performance improvements in the capillary-fed cell. The cathode and anode produced bubbles at similar rates at still higher current densities, to 1 A cm-2. Even at 1 A cm -2 , the rate of bubble formation on the electrodes was substantially lower than in conventional, 'bubbled' electrolysis cells. In the course of this work, the previously reported high electrochemical performance of the capillary-fed cell was independently confirmed.    IndependentFigure 1 .1Figure 1.

Yet, the operando X-ray scattering investigations were restricted only to few electrochemical studies, while the technique has never been applied to monitor the surface of photoactive films in a PEC cell. In this work, we close this gap. We develop an operando grazing-incidence X-ray scattering approach that allows to assess the evolution of structural processes at the surface of a photoactive film in a PEC cell during operation, as shown in Figure and Figure . We use a high-energy X-ray probe and a large-area detector to collect the TS signal at grazing-incidence angle with enhanced surface sensitivity. Simultaneously, we use a second largearea detector to collect the SAXS signal. We apply the technique to monitor operando the structural evolution of a copper bismuth oxide film as a model system. CuBi2O4 has recently emerged as a promising PEC material due to its favorable electronic properties, namely a suitable bandgap of 1.6-1.8 eV , p-type conductivity, and a very cathodic onset potential of ca. 1 V vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode). However, the achievable photocurrents from bare CuBi2O4 electrodes are limited by the poor charge carrier mobility and the short carrier diffusion length and decay rapidly in steady-state conditions while at the same time no hydrogen is produced, thus indicating that the measured photoactivity likely restrict to a photocorrosion process. It has been suggested that CuBi2O4 electrodes might degrade similarly to Cu2O during operation, i.e. via consumption of the photogenerated electrons to the reduction of the Cu 2+ cations to either Cu + or Cu 0 . However, this hypothesis lacks of experimental evidence. Here we', 'IntroductionPhoto-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting is currently one of the most promising approaches for the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen gas (H2), which can be then transported and used on demand as a green energy carrier. In a PEC cell, a semiconductor is immersed in an electrolyte and the charge carriers are generated under light illumination at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, effectively combining light absorption and catalysis in a single device. One major challenge to this approach is the intrinsic low stability of most semiconductors which rapidly degrade when in contact with the electrolyte during PEC measurements. Common degradation pathways include the dissolution of the photoabsorbing material into the electrolyte, phase transformations due to the reduction/oxidation of the metallic species under applied bias and/or illumination, loss of the semiconductor layer from the electrode surface, and the morphological restructuring of the electrode surface. Such complex degradation mechanisms cause the decline of its PEC performances. For example, Cu2O photocathodes reduce during operation to the inactive metallic Cu phase and concurrently oxidize to release Cu 2+ ions into the electrolyte. BiVO4 photoanodes dissolve into stoichiometric Bi and V species leading to a progressively reduced thickness of the photoabsorbing layer, while the surface of metal nitride electrodes passivates due to the formation of a metal oxide layer, which prevents the efficient charge transport at the semiconductorelectrolyte interface. Understanding the mechanisms underlying photocorrosion constitutes the fundamental prerequisite to improve the durability of PEC', 'at the Cu K-edge of films (Figure ) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) of electrolyte solution Figure .The XANES data show the presence of 1.5 % and 12 % of metallic Cu inside the CuBi2O4 electrode after 40 minutes and 4 hours of chronoamperometry at 0.5 V vs RHE, respectively. The ICP-MS measurements display a steady increase in the concentration of Cu species in solution both, before and during the chronoamperometry. However, no Bi ions could be detected in the electrolyte. While ICP-MS does not provide information over the oxidation state of the detected Cu species, the Pourbaix diagram of Cu indicates that the most stable copper species at the electrolyte pH of 5.7 and the OCP potential of the CuBi2O4 electrode (~ 0.5V vs. RHE) is Cu 2+ .[7a] Moreover, SEM/EDX images, Figure , clearly show the presence of BiPO4 structures which grows on top of the CuBi2O4 film as multiple branches, with single branches growing even up to few micrometers in length. Figure schematically illustrates both the chemical species and structural modifications detected in electrolyte and at the surface of the electrode as a result of either the reduction or the dissolution of the pristine CuBi2O4 material under applied external bias and illumination. Therefore, unlike hypothesized in the literature, our results reveal that the formation of metallic Bi rather than metallic Cu is the most prominent outcome of the photo-electrochemical degradation of CuBi2O4 by cathodic photocorrosion. However, ex situ characterizations do not reveal the degradation time scales. Operando structural characterization by X-ray scattering. While the ex-situ characterization permits to identify various changes of the electrode, it is not possible to pinpoint which phenomena are responsible for the abrupt', 'SummaryIn this work, we show an operando high-energy X-ray scattering method to investigate the photocorrosion mechanisms and relative time scales on photo-electrochemically active CuBi2O4 electrodes. We measure TS and SAXS simultaneously in grazing incidence to reveal structural modification close to the CuBi2O4-electrolyte interface. We show that under illumination and applied bias the CuBi2O4 electrodes quickly undergo a cathodic photocorrosion process which determines the formation of a segregating metallic Bi phase. This process takes place on a time scale of only few minutes after beginning of the chronoamperometry and correlates with a decrease of around one order of magnitude in the observed photocurrents. Moreover, additional degradation processes occur on slower time scales: formation of metallic Cu and dissolution in the electrolyte as an effect of both anionic photocorrosion and acidic dissolution. The two phenomena cause a steady release of Cu 2+ ions in solution as well as the crystallization of BiPO4 branched structures at the surface of the electrode due to the interaction of the releasing Bi 3+ ions with the phosphate species in the electrolyte. The formation of an insulating BiPO4 layer is likely responsible for the slow decrease in the measured photocurrents at intermediate and later stages of the chronoamperometry.In summary, our study shows that the high-energy X-ray scattering can probe structural information ranging from atomic to nanometer length scales in a realistic experimental environment, thus allowing to simultaneously correlate chemical and morphological modification of the film electrode with changes of photocurrent. Understanding how photoactive electrodes degrade under operation conditions is the first step towards new strategies for increasing the long-term stability and improving efficiency, but also planning the sustainable disposal strategies. In the future, the', 'underlying photocorrosion constitutes the fundamental prerequisite to improve the durability of PEC electrodes by establishment of appropriate mitigation strategies. Moreover, as there will be a limited lifetime of PEC electrodes, i.e., after operation they will need to be disposed as waste, insights into their degradation on various time scales will enable development of sustainable disposal approaches. The in situ and operando methods hold the promise to provide systematic insights into the photocorrosion phenomena by monitoring the PEC material under relevant timescales and operating conditions, i.e. under applied bias and illumination. So far, techniques such as ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and in-situ UV-Vis spectroscopy have been used to assess the photocorrosion mechanism of Cu2O, WO3, BiVO4 and n-GaP photoelectrodes under realistic working conditions.

The standard deviation of the charge distribution across the ensemble is just 0.02 e, supporting previous observations that the underlying DDEC atoms-in-molecule charges are relatively independent of conformation. It is important to test whether these system-specific force field parameters translate into more accurate protein interactions and dynamics. In this regard, although the conformational preferences of the peptides tested in the previous section are promising, it is not known whether the torsional parameters will continue to be appropriate for use with proteins. As the non-bonded parameters vary with the system studied, the transferability of torsional parameters cannot be readily assumed. To assess this we begin by studying MD simulations of the proteins ubiquitin and GB3.The J coupling errors for ubiquitin and GB3 are summarized in Table . With an overall RMSE of 1.54 Hz, the error using the QUBE force field for ubiquitin is higher than that of OPLS-AA/M, which has an RMSE of 1.12 Hz, but lower than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L with errors of 1.84 Hz and 1.70 Hz respectively. 1 GB3 follows the same trend with an RMSE of 1.10 Hz for the QUBE force field, compared to the error for OPLS-AA/M of 0.90 Hz, whilst OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L both have an error of 1.46 Hz. 1 The J coupling results suggest that whilst the transfer of torsional parameters from dipeptides to proteins may cause some issues, the QUBE force field remains more accurate than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L.

In this paper, we introduce a complete protein force field that is designed to be compatible with the QUantum mechanical BEspoke (QUBE) force field by deriving non-bonded parameters directly from the electron density of the specific protein under study. The main backbone and sidechain protein torsional parameters are re-derived in this work by fitting to quantum mechanical dihedral scans for compatibility with QUBE non-bonded parameters. Software is provided for the preparation of QUBE input files. The accuracy of the new force field, and the derived torsional parameters, are tested by comparing the conformational preferences of a range of peptides and proteins with experimental measurements. Accurate backbone and sidechain conformations are obtained in molecular dynamics simulations of dipeptides, with NMR J coupling errors comparable to the widely-used OPLS force field. In simulations of five folded proteins, the secondary structure is generally retained and the NMR J coupling errors are similar to standard transferable force fields, although some loss of the experimental structure is observed in certain regions of the proteins. With several avenues for further development, the use of system-specific nonbonded force field parameters is a promising approach for next-generation simulations of biological molecules.', 'emerges is that this first generation quantum mechanical bespoke force field is an improvement over legacy OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L force fields, but is out-performed by the most recent OPLS-AA/M force field for simulated dynamics of folded proteins in their native state. While we have previously shown that DDEC charges are not too dependent on small conformation changes, 28 further investigation is needed to establish the utility of QUBE for protein folding simulations.Hence, although we have outlined our roadmap to future improvements, a natural question is: where can the QUBE protein force field be used now (especially given the higher cost of parameterization compared to transferable force fields)? Importantly, it has been shown previously that the use of system-specific force field charges leads to improvements in binding energetics of small molecules, and reproduction of the QM electrostatic potential for both small molecules 27 and proteins. Therefore, although simulated protein backbone dynamics is an important test, we envisage the QUBE small molecule and protein force field being particularly important for the study of intermolecular interactions in the condensed phase.Indeed, QUBE was originally developed to provide, by construction, a compatible protein and small molecule force field for computer-aided drug design, where an accurate surface electrostatic potential of the protein is crucial. In this regard, the absolute binding free energies between the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme and six benzene analogs have been recently computed using QUBE with a mean unsigned error of 0.85 kcal/mol, which compares very favorably with OPLS-AA/M (1.26 kcal/mol). Although further work is required to establish this accuracy across a significantly wider range of protein-ligand complexes, the promise of these initial biomolecular simulation', 'Torsional Parameter FittingThe final backbone torsional parameters and associated errors in the recreation of the QM energy scans are given in Section S3.2 of the Supporting Information. For the alanine and glycine scans, the error for the QUBE force field evaluated using eq 5 is 1.25 kcal/mol compared to 0.93 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M, which is a reasonable level of agreement. For proline and serine, the errors remain comparable to OPLS-AA/M.For the sidechain torsional parameters (Section S3.3), the mean error in the recreation of the QM potential energy scans for the QUBE force field is 1.29 kcal/mol, compared to 1.12 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M. Particularly high errors occur for both the œá 1 and œá 2 glutamic acid scans, and the glutamine œá 2 scan. For glutamic acid, the error is also high for the OPLS-AA/M force field parameters, but the rotamer populations remained close to the experimental data, and this may be due to a problem with the functional form used in classical force fields. The OPLS-AA/M error in the potential energy scan for glutamine is roughly half that of the QUBE force field. However, as we will show, the accuracy of the glutamine dipeptide MD simulations is good, and so no further refinement was made to the sidechain torsional parameters in this work.Although a low error in the reproduction of the QM potential energy surface is clearly the desired result, this does not necessarily correspond to accurate non-bonded force field parameters. The degree to which torsional parameters can improve the fit between MM and QM scans depends not only on the accuracy of the non-bonded, and bond and angle, parameters, but also on the shape of the energy difference between the QM and MM scans.The functional form used in classical MM force fields is very restrictive. However, the energy difference between the QM and MM energy scans must be', 'that facilitates the derivation of small organic molecule force field parameters, and also allows the user to derive the positions of off-site charges to model anisotropic electron density and to fit dihedral parameters to QM torsion scans. QUBE force fields have been derived for 109 small organic molecules, and yield mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm 3 , 0.79 kcal/mol and 1.17 kcal/mol in computed liquid density, heat of vaporization and free energy of hydration. These results are competitive with standard transferable force fields, which have been extensively fit to properties such as these.To achieve our goal of employing the QUBE force field in computer-aided drug design applications, we require a compatible protein force field. Since the non-bonded parametrization strategy employed in QUBE is very different to that used in the standard biomolecular force fields (e.g. AMBER, OPLS, CHARMM), there is no reason to believe that they are compatible. However, by implementing the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameter derivation methods in the ONETEP linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) software, we have shown that it is feasible to derive these charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for entire proteins. In this way, the number of fitting parameters is substantially reduced, and we have a consistent parametrization approach that can be applied to both small and large molecules, including entire biomolecular assemblies. Since, in this approach, all non-bonded parameters are derived from a single QM calculation, both the charge and Lennard-Jones parameters naturally include the native state polarization effects of the environment. Importantly, we have shown that protein charges derived using DDEC electron density partitioning recreate the underlying QM electrostatic potential with high accuracy,']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Unclassified']",349,1,1,0,0.924296189,2.22E-16,['why']

However, whole cell reactions were not effective for ClaD, leading us to perform reactions using filtered crude cell lysate. Both of these reaction platforms provide an operationally-simple method for preparing and using NHI biocatalysts in a manner that is amenable to preparative-scale reactions, avoiding arduous protein purification steps. Analytical-scale reactions revealed that CitB and ClaD each selectively hydroxylate compounds with a variety of steric and electronic properties (Fig. ). Introducing bulky, electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at either the C5 or C6 position did not prevent productive reactions with CitB. However, ClaD demonstrated limitations in its ability to accept larger groups, such as phenyl substituents at C5 and C6. The complementarity of substrate scopes between CitB and ClaD is also observed in the substitution at C4. For CitB, the formyl group at C4 can be substituted with alternative electronwithdrawing substituents such as a nitro group (25) or imine (24). However, substrates with greater steric bulk at C4, such as ketone substrates, were generally not hydroxylated by CitB. In contrast, ClaD can productively react with a variety of ketones (see 9, 27-30). The importance of this C4 substituent is also highlighted by the lack of reaction observed with 2,5-dimethylresorcinol (23).

Next, the reactivity of benzylic alcohol 17 was investigated under aqueous conditions. Gratifyingly, upon gentle heating in the presence of thiophenol, alcohol 17 was quantitatively transformed into thioether 20 through an anticipated o-QM intermediate (18-19). These experiments provided evidence for o-QM formation under remarkably mild conditions compared to previous reports for the generation of o-QMs from ortho-hydroxy benzylic alcohols. Evidence that CitB is sufficiently robust to perform preparative-scale reactions and provide access to o-QMs under mild conditions spurred further investigation of this chemoenzymatic strategy for benzylic functionalization, including studies with the homologous NHI enzyme, ClaD. To investigate the substrate scope of CitB and ClaD, a panel of substrates was synthesized possessing an ortho-cresol core (Fig. ). This panel was designed to define the electronic and steric parameters of substrates that undergo a productive reaction with the NHI biocatalysts.

For', ""RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONToward developing a chemoenzymatic method for benzylic C-H functionalization, we tested the feasibility of biocatalytic C-H hydroxylation, coupled with o-QM formation and derivatization with a model substrate (see 16, Fig. ) that captures the conserved methyl resorcinol core of CitB and ClaD's native substrates. This model compound maintained the redox-sensitive aldehyde moiety and hydroxyl groups present in the citrinin biosynthetic intermediate (7). This model compound, 16, was completely consumed in 3 h upon exposure to 0.4 mol % CitB in the presence of Œ±-KG, an iron(II) source and sodium ascorbate in 50 mM TES buffer at pH 7.5 (Fig. ). From this reaction, a single benzylic alcohol product (17) was isolated in 82% yield without any evidence of oxidation of either the aldehyde or the resorcinol core. This result demonstrated that CitB could function on a non-native substrate with the robustness needed for preparative-scale synthesis with precise chemo-and site-selectivity. As a comparative measure, we subjected substrate 16 to several chemical oxidation conditions and did not observe conversion to desired benzylic alcohol 17 (see Supporting Information, Table ). For example, attempts to oxidize 16 with DDQ resulted in over-oxidation to the bisaldehdye and exposure of 16 to MnO2 40 or Ag2O 41 resulted in no observed reaction. Efforts to perform a benzylic hydroxylation with K2S2O8 or cerium ammonium nitrate led to decomposition of the substrate. Radical bromination with AIBN/NBS resulted in aromatic bromination and did not generate the desired benzylic halide for subsequent hydrolysis to the benzyl alcohol.

Current efforts are focused on obtaining engineered enzyme variants that do not require substrates bearing a hydrogen bond acceptor, such as an aldehyde, for a productive reaction to occur. To probe the substrate scope of our biocatalysts beyond resorcinol substrates, phenolic compounds 39 and S5 (see Supporting Information) were subjected to CitB hydroxylation conditions. Phenol 39 was converted to the corresponding benzylic alcohol; however, the position of the hydroxyl group proved to be important for catalysis as phenol S5 was not oxidized by either CitB or ClaD. These results motivated us to synthesize an additional panel of phenolic substrates to further assess the scope of NHI biocatalytic hydroxylation (40-42). In the case of CitB, increasing the steric bulk at the C5 position increased the conversion of substrates to hydroxylated products except for 2-naphthyl substrate 42, which demonstrated decreased conversion, possibly reflecting the steric limitations of the CitB active site. ClaD was unable to hydroxylate phenolic substrates 40-42.As a next step in the evaluation of the synthetic utility of the NHI dioxygenase-catalyzed benzylic C-H hydroxylation, we performed reactions on preparative-scale using whole cell (CitB) and crude cell lysate (ClaD) conditions (Fig. ). This method enabled routine performance of reactions on >500 mg scale without the requirement for protein purification. Isolation and characterization of C5-substituted benzylic alcohol products 17 and 46-48 was achieved with yields that corresponded to starting material consumption. For example, benzylic alcohol 17 was isolated in 82% yield. However, poor isolated yields were obtained for substrates with C6-substituents, despite nearly complete consumption of starting material (see 49-53).

Cox and coworkers demonstrated through in vivo experiments that CitB performs a benzylic hydroxylation in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin citrinin (8, Fig. ). ClaD was shown by Li and coworkers to perform a similar transformation in the biosynthesis of peniphenones and penilactones (Fig. , 9-11). We envisioned employing CitB and ClaD as general catalysts for benzylic hydroxylation of ortho-cresol substrates. We anticipated that, following benzylic C-H bond oxidation, an o-QM intermediate (see 12-14 Fig. ) could be accessed and intercepted with a variety of nucleophiles or dienophiles to form benzylic C-O, C-N, C-S, and C-C bonds in a biomimetic fashion.

On the contrary, the fluorescence intensity of most of imine-linked carbazole-based COFs, such as BCTB-PD COF, BCTB-BCTA COF, and BCTA-TP COF, declined significantly under these harsh conditions because of protonation or deprotonation of imine-linked frameworks.

Small rod-like structures have been found for three different H-aggregates of zeaxanthin .

These absorption transitions redshift with increasing polarizability of the environment, the 0-0 transition reaching 543 nm in carbon disulfide (figure 1, dotted blue line) . Lycopene aggregates (red curve in figure ) display a very different absorption spectrum, featuring a pronounced band peaking at 355 nm with a shoulder around 375 nm, then two bands at ca 414 & 481 nm, and a very redshifted band at 568 nm.

From the analysis of the \uf06e1 and \uf06e2 regions, we observe that the sample contains at least four, and probably five species of lycopene aggregates. These observations are further supported by the complicated dynamics of femtosecond-to-nanosecond transient absorption. While it is, in principle, conceivable that a single type of aggregate or crystal could exhibit the number of evolutionary steps observed, it is hard to see how so many steps would result in the rise and fall of so many bands at more or less the same wavelengths.

We have already hypothesized three coexisting moieties with at least five (S2, hot S1, S1, S*, T1) interconnected excited states. This is more than enough to over-parametrize the datasets that are satisfactorily described by the 8 time constants (five in the fs-ns range plus three in the ns-¬µs range).The electronic signatures for the excited states are highly distorted from the well-characterized signatures for monomeric or weakly-interacting carotenoids. It is reasonable that the excited states experiment a similar degree of aggregation-associated spectral distortion as that seen for the ground states in the absorption spectrum.

However, based on the lifetimes obtained it is tempting to propose a tentative assignment as follows: \uf03c 500 fs EADS to S2-like state, ca. 1p EADS to hot-S1-like state, 10-11ps EADS to S1-like state, 46-60ps EADS to S*-like state, which would then be the parent state for triplets, and the ca 550 ps EADS to interacting triplet states. It is clear that in order to better understand the spectroscopic properties of lycopene aggregates, it is necessary to design an alternative experimental protocol where each aggregate type can be observed selectively. This would allow us to propose more sophisticated models than the current linear scheme. The selective purification of each species of lycopene aggregate would clearly be ideal, but this may well turn out to be extremely complex given the number of different aggregate types formed here and reported in the literature. An alternative would be to use time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy, which should be sensitive enough to separate and distinguish the different excited states involved. Indeed, the selectivity of resonance Raman spectroscopy, and its sensitivity to the different arrangements of lycopene aggregates in their ground state, is illustrated very clearly in Figure .

Apart from the energy transfer processes in biology like respiration and photosynthesis, key biological transformations like monooxygenation is rate limited by ET. In addition to the biological processes, manoeuvring the ET between the electrode and molecular materials is key to molecular electronic devices. Long range ET, its mechanism and factors that intrinsically controls it are of interest to the scientific community. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of organic thiols on coinage metals like Au, Ag, Cu and Pt has been evolved to be a convenient model system for investigating ET through molecular closed-packed films as these systems are modular and amenable to chemical modifications. In particular, self-assembled of organothiol monolayers on Au electrodes are extensively used due to the thermodynamic stability of Au-S bond and the inertness of Au towards oxidation. The kinetics of ET between the electrode and a redox active moiety through SAM can be monitored by electrochemical, photochemical and temperature jump techniques.

The ET rate from the Au electrode to the covalently bound EtnFc across the SAM has been determined using chronoamperometry. Chronoamperometry is a very useful tool for the determination of apparent ET rate (kapp) from an electrode to a redox active species bound to various SAMs modified electrode. In CA experiments, the faradaic current decays according to the following exponential relationship. i = kapp Q exp (-kappt) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. (1)  where Q denotes the amount of charge passed during this redox transformation. The CA current decay comprises two types of processes, one for the overall capacitive current decay and the other is due to the faradaic current decay of the attached redox active moiety. The charging current decays very much faster than the faradaic current. This helps to determine the kapp of ET from the electrode to the attached redox active species by simply choosing the appropriate time scale of decay. The plot of Ln(i) vs. time is linear and its slope yields the value of kapp. Chronoamperograms of N3C11SH-C8SH SAM-modified Au electrodes demonstrate a complete decay of charging currents within 0.2 ms time scale (Fig. ) whereas the faradaic currents decay completely at 7.5 ms when EtnFc covalently bound to it (Fig. ).

In the first 8 minutes of operation the amplitude of the scattering signal (I(qx,y min)) at low-q values quickly increases and reaches a maximum after 20 min, thus indicating that the bulk porosity increases during the initial stage of CA.

We measure TS and SAXS simultaneously in grazing incidence to reveal structural modification close to the CuBi2O4-electrolyte interface. We show that under illumination and applied bias the CuBi2O4 electrodes quickly undergo a cathodic photocorrosion process which determines the formation of a segregating metallic Bi phase. This process takes place on a time scale of only few minutes after beginning of the chronoamperometry and correlates with a decrease of around one order of magnitude in the observed photocurrents. Moreover, additional degradation processes occur on slower time scales: formation of metallic Cu and dissolution in the electrolyte as an effect of both anionic photocorrosion and acidic dissolution. The two phenomena cause a steady release of Cu 2+ ions in solution as well as the crystallization of BiPO4 branched structures at the surface of the electrode due to the interaction of the releasing Bi 3+ ions with the phosphate species in the electrolyte. The formation of an insulating BiPO4 layer is likely responsible for the slow decrease in the measured photocurrents at intermediate and later stages of the chronoamperometry.In summary, our study shows that the high-energy X-ray scattering can probe structural information ranging from atomic to nanometer length scales in a realistic experimental environment, thus allowing to simultaneously correlate chemical and morphological modification of the film electrode with changes of photocurrent.

However, bilayer BMSs present large gaps within their band structure below the VBM, which inhibits the movement of electrons within the material. To remedy this issue and as proof of concept, we added another fully intercalated COF layer to the V-05 structure, which provided more intermediate electronic density levels while preserving its bipolar magnetic semiconducting character.

Our main hypothesis is that by controlling the intercalated d-block elements and concentrations, we will be able to modify their interlayer interactions (by promoting interactions between the COF œÄ-orbitals and TM d-orbitals), which can lead to fine-tuning their electronic and magnetic behavior. Such changes include, for example, modifying the 2D COF\'s natural insulating behavior to that of a semiconductor, by promoting the appearance of available states near the Fermi level via COF p-orbital and TM d-orbital interactions.

Very similar resultswere obtained for the two techniques, with little bubble formation observed up to 0.17-0.20 A cm -2 . At higher current densities, up to around 0.6 A cm -2 , bubbles were formed predominantly at the cathode. Given that commercial alkaline electrolysers typically operate at current densities up to 0.6 A cm -2 , this suggests that minimizing bubble formation at the cathode offers the key opportunity for further performance improvements in the capillary-fed cell. The cathode and anode produced bubbles at similar rates at still higher current densities, to 1 A cm-2. Even at 1 A cm -2 , the rate of bubble formation on the electrodes was substantially lower than in conventional, 'bubbled' electrolysis cells.

A Hg/HgO reference electrode was then introduced into the resulting cavity, such that its active end was immersed in the liquid electrolyte in the reservoir. The electrical connections were then made as described above, with the cell or its contents maintained under an inert Ar atmosphere.A disadvantage of this alternative arrangement was that even moderate evaporation during an experiment could change the molarity of the KOH electrolyte, thereby changing the area-specific resistance (ASR) between the electrodes and altering the cell performance.Nevertheless, the cell could be used successfully if experiments were carried out quickly and carefully.

The electrodes, which are sandwiched tightly against opposite sides of the separator in a zero-gap configuration, draw small amounts of liquid electrolyte laterally out of the separator causing them to be completely covered with only a thin layer of the liquid electrolyte. The gas formed on the electrode surface can then migrate through the thin layer of liquid electrolyte into an adjoining gas chamber, without forming gas bubbles. The outcome of this arrangement is that the energy efficiency of the cell is significantly improved.

At 8 mM, this rate of ISC would account for 22% of triplets formed by 8 ns. So as with TIPS-Pn, the assumption of negligible ISC when fitting the bimolecular SF rate constant is potentially invalid.

This concentration corresponds to a maximum absorption of about 0.004 mOD, which is well below the possible threshold of our TA spectrometer (supplementary material Fig. ), and still leaves 3.7 √ó 10 -9 M of T 1 that could be due to ISC.If we allow an ISC rate constant of 3.08 √ó 10 6 s -1 (or a time constant of 325 ns) on top of the contribution from SF, 3.7 √ó 10 -9 M of T 1 are produced from ISC, and we obtain a total T 1 concentration of reach the 4.0 √ó 10 -9 M, or 0.057 mOD T 1 absorption limit, at 8 ns. The actual ISC rate constant therefore must be lower than (or equal to) this value, as a higher value would result in a level of triplet formation that would be observable above the noise level in the TA data.We therefore give the ISC rate constant an upper bound of 3.08 √ó 10 6 s -1 , i.e., the characteristic time scale of ISC in TIPS-Pn must be longer than 325 ns. This corresponds to a ISC quantum yield of ‚â§5.6% at 0.05 mM. The 8 ns time window we use in this study is significantly shorter than this time constant, and we note that ISC could possibly be shown to be even slower with a longer time-window TA experiment. equal to the experimental data. Even with this noise, there is a slight observable trend with time in the modeled data corresponding to an increase in T 1', 'target=""#b7"">8 Given the solubility of TIPS-Pn in toluene is similar to chloroform, we expect that aggregation was absent in the solutions studied here.For TIPS-Tn, the singlet decay rate constant, k S 1 , was fixed to 1/12.7 ns -1 (taken from the relaxation lifetime of the singlet excited state in the dilute solution in Sec. S4.1 of the supplementary material) minus the ISC and SF contributions (k ISC and k SF √ó 0.05 mM). The triplet decay rate constant was fixed to 1/80 ¬µs -1 , taken from the lifetime used by Dover et al.. Again, the triplet lifetime is substantially longer than the timescales measured here, and has little effect on the fit.The resulting kinetic model fits are shown in Fig. , where again the shaded gray region represents the range of possible kinetics that fit the triplet concentration. This model is able to capture the behavior of TIPS-Tn reasonably well. The triplet formation kinetics are reproduced well, and the singlet decay has some small discrepancies, which, as with TIPS-Pn, we attribute to solvent reorganization or the presence of some additional S 1 deactivation pathways.

"I. INTRODUCTIONSinglet fission (SF) is a process in which a chromophore in the singlet excited state, S 1 , combines with a nearby ground-state chromophore, S 0 , to produce two independent triplet excitons, T 1 . It is generally described as proceeding via a spin-correlated triplet-pair intermediate, with overall singlet character:S 0 + S 1 ---- 1 (TT) ---- 1 (T...T) ----T 1 + T 1 ,(1)where (TT) is an electronically coupled and spin-coherent triplet pair, and 1 (T...T) is a triplet pair that maintains spin coherence, but has lost electronic coherence, and thus behaves chemically and spectroscopically like free triplets. The generation of two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton, and hence a single photon, could increase the efficiency of solar cells beyond the detailed-balance limit, and hence has attracted significant recent attention. However, sizeable improvements to solar-cell efficiency using SF have not been achieved to date, so there are continuing efforts to increase the efficiency of SF as well as the ""harvestability"" of the triplet excitons. But for SF to be optimized, it is important to be able to accurately identify and characterize the process, including distinguishing SF from other photophysical processes that result in triplet excitons.Another process that forms triplet excitons from singlet excitons is intersystem crossing (ISC):the radiationless transition between two electronic states of different spin multiplicities. Triplet formation",Causal,Why could the generation of two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton potentially increase the efficiency of solar cells?,Answer not available from the given context. ,Negative,"['The generation of two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton, and hence a single photon, could increase the efficiency of solar cells beyond the detailed-balance limit, and hence has attracted significant recent attention.']","[[629, 854]]","['and the bimolecular rate constant would no longer be applicable. Using the rate constants fit to a system with aggregates would overestimate the rates at more dilute, diffusion-limited concentrations. The underestimation of triplet excitons at 8 mM by the Dover model is partially explained by the underestimation of SF and overestimation of excimer formation: if excimers predominantly result from aggregates and are absent at lower concentrations, then collisions at 8 mM are more likely to result in SF, and more triplet formation.Additionally, the presence of aggregates would explain the fast rate of triplet fusion at high TIPS-Tn concentration. If SF at 300 mM occurs on an aggregated pair of TIPS-Tn molecules, then the triplets are not well separated spatially and can recombine quickly. However, in a dilute solution with no aggregates, in which SF occurs during transient collisions, the molecules may diffuse away before the triplets recombine. Therefore the triplet fusion rate would be lower and a more significant amount of triplets would be observed. We note that the presence of aggregates at 300 mM does not affect the main conclusion of the study by Dover et al., i.e., that the excimer is a trap state rather than an intermediate. However, for the remainder of this study, we revert to the much simpler model shown in Eqs. ( ) and ( ) to describe SF in this system.As mentioned previously, we neglect the reverse SF process, triplet fusion, in this model. This assumption is justified in TIPS-Pn, as fusion is energetically uphill. For both TIPS-Pn and TIPS-Tn, the model fits well without triplet fusion, and so presumably it plays only a minor role. The other assumption made here is that the ISC rate is negligible compared to SF, but, as we show below, this assumption may not necessarily be the case.', 'Pitfalls of quantifying intersystem crossing rates in singlet-fission chromophore solutions Singlet fission (SF), a process that produces two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton, has attracted recent interest for its potential to circumvent the detailed-balance efficiency limit of single-junction solar cells. For the potential of SF to be fully realized, accurate assignment and quantification of SF is necessary. Intersystem crossing (ISC) is another process of singlet to triplet conversion that is important to distinguish from SF to avoid either over-or under-estimation of SF triplet production. Here, we quantify an upper bound on the rate of ISC in two commonly studied SF chromophores, TIPS-pentacene and TIPStetracene, by using transient absorption spectroscopy of solutions of varying concentrations in toluene. We show that SF in solutions of these acenes has previously been misidentified as ISC, and vice versa. By determining a bimolecular SF rate constant in concentrated solutions in which SF dominates over ISC, we distinguish triplet formation due to SF from triplet formation due to ISC, and show that the characteristic time scale of ISC must be longer than 325 ns in TIPS-pentacene, while it must be longer than 118 ns in TIPStetracene. We additionally note that no excimer formation is observed in the relatively dilute (up to 8 mM) solutions studied here, indicating that previous excimer formation observed at much higher concentrations may be partially due to aggregate formation. This work highlights that an accurate quantification of ISC is crucial as it leads to accurate determination of SF rate constants and yields.', 'on two commonly studied SF chromophores: 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-Pn) and 5,12-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) tetracene (TIPS-Tn).Several studies have previously reported ISC rates for TIPS-Pn that are inconsistent with experimental data. These rates correspond to time constants ranging from ns to ¬µs, with some predicting observable quantities of triplets on timescales over which triplets have not been observed. These studies have often dismissed SF in dilute solutions and attributed triplet formation to ISC. For TIPS-Pn, we extend the work by Dvo≈ô√°k et al. to quantify diffusion-limited SF in dilute solutions, and show that SF can lead to observable quantities of triplet excitons for dilute solutions on ns time scales. We quantify an upper bound of the rate constant of ISC in TIPS-Pn and show that, conversely, discounting ISC can lead to an overestimate of SF.We also quantify the SF rate constant and the upper bound of the ISC rate constant in TIPS-Tn, and show that ISC is potentially faster, and even more important to consider for this molecule than for TIPS-Pn. We additionally note that excimer formation is not observed in dilute solutions of TIPS-Tn, even when SF is observed, and therefore suggest that previously observed excimer formation may be due to aggregate formation in concentrated solutions.', 'states of different spin multiplicities. Triplet formation through ISC can be described as a simple unimolecular process:S 1 ----T 1 .(2)ISC is distinct from SF in that it only relies on one chromophore rather than two, results in at most one triplet per singlet exciton, does not involve observable intermediate species (such as triplet pairs), and is often considered to be much slower than SF (times scales of ns, compared to ps or fs).Generally ISC and SF are distinguished by their time scale and the amount of triplets observed.Again, SF is generally thought to be faster, and should result in a triplet yield (per singlet exciton) greater than 100%, whereas ISC is slower, and should give a triplet yield less than 100%. However, determining yields of triplets can be complex, and triplet production can easily be over-or underestimated. Additionally, SF is not always completely efficient, and can occur with a yield below 100%. Finally, SF, particularly in solution and in disordered solid-state systems is not necessarily always fast. A recent study by Dvo≈ô√°k et al. showed that SF in TIPS-Pn solutions occurs by diffusive encounters, and so can be very slow in dilute solutions. SF has also been shown to be limited by exciton diffusion to SF-favorable sites in disordered acenes, and so can be considerably slow in disordered solids or systems with substantial singlet migration. In this study, we show that SF can be misidentified as ISC and vice versa, and demonstrate the need to take precaution in the assignment and interpretation of photophysical processes in SF-capable systems, particularly using optical spectroscopy. We focus on two commonly studied SF chromophores: 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-Pn) and', 'is due to excimer formation, rather than SF. Only about 3% of singlet excitons undergo SF to form T 1 . Additionally, a maximum T 1 yield of only 1.25% is observed, because most of the triplets formed rapidly undergo triplet fusion. A significant amount of excimer formation is predicted by the Dover model at 8 mM (34%), but, as discussed previously, the TA data fits well to just two components (S 1 and T 1 ) without additional absorption or emission that could be due to excimers. It is possible that the spectral component we assign to T 1 could instead be due to excimers, but, as we show in Fig. of the supplementary material, the spectral shape is consistent with previously assigned T 1 basis spectra. Additionally, the excimer state is emissive, but there is an absence of any obvious emission features in the basis spectrum that correspond to the excimer emission characterized by Dover et al.. Instead, we attribute the discrepancy between the Dover model and the TA data in this study to the concentrations of TIPS-Tn used. Both Dover et al. and Stern et al. used concentrations of 300 mM, 37.5 times higher than the 8 mM samples used here. We observed that agitation is required to dissolve 8 mM solutions of TIPS-Tn in toluene, and therefore propose that at a concentration of 300 mM TIPS-Tn may only be partially soluble, and consequently that aggregation may begin to occur at that concentration.Excimer formation may be facilitated by these aggregates, and is therefore absent at more dilute concentrations. Aggregate formation would explain why the decay of the S 1 state at 8 mM is overestimated by the Dover model. If SF or excimer formation were due to aggregates rather than, or in addition to, collisions between molecules, then the pseudo-first-order SF rate constants at 300 mM would not scale linearly with concentration, and the bimolecular rate constant would no longer be applicable.

This scan reveals that the structure found by Sella (the structure at zero degrees) is not the lowest-energy conformer for this reaction. This is not surprising, as our saddle point optimization algorithm tends to converge to the saddle point that is geometrically closest to the initial structure, and this may not be the lowest energy conformer.Figure shows how the total number of gradient evaluations required to perform the entire scan (in green) and the number of gradient evaluations per scan step (in red) scale as a function of the number of scan steps used.

Though the total number of gradient evaluations tends to increase with the number of steps used in the scan, the relationship is not perfectly linear.

This information is contained within the Hessian matrix, some (or all) of which must be known to step towards a saddle point. Optimization to a first order saddle point requires stepping uphill on the potential energy surface in the direction of the reaction coordinate and downhill in all other directions. We define the reaction coordinate as the direction in which the curvature is smallest (most negative or least positive), which is by construction the leftmost eigenvector of the Hessian matrix. Therefore it is at least necessary to know this eigenvector to step towards a first order saddle point.For molecular saddle point optimization, it is common to evaluate the full Hessian matrix at least once at the beginning of optimization. Many electronic structure theory methods such as Hartree-Fock and DFT have efficient analytical Hessian implementations. Additionally, transformation of Cartesian Hessians into internal coordinates is straightforward. When using a level of theory for which efficient analytical second derivatives are not available, the Hessian matrix is usually evaluated in full using finite difference. For computationally expensive levels of theory or for very large molecules, the evaluation of the initial Hessian matrix may become more costly than all subsequent geometry optimization steps.

In this scenario, our optimization algorithm will instead automatically reconstruct a new internal coordinate system, rather than falling back on Cartesian optimization. This results in a robust optimization algorithm similar to Q-Chem, without the additional cost of switching to a Cartesian optimization scheme.We note that while each of the four alternative algorithms resulted in some of the structures failing to converge, we do not consider this to be an appropriate metric for comparison, as the molecules in the test set were specifically chosen to be those that converge in Sella with its default parameters.

"Updates on Hydrogen Value Chain: A Strategic Roadmap A strategic roadmap for non-carbonized fuels is a global priority, and the reduction of CO2 emissions is a key focus of the Paris Agreement to mitigate the effects of rising temperatures.

The strategy framework delineates a path that advocates for the adoption of energy-efficient and the utilization of renewable energy sources.Hydrogen (H2) is expected to play a significant and central role in our future society, particularly within the current efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy. The main reasons why H2 is becoming such an important commodity are:‚Ä¢ H2 is a clean energy source, producing no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when used in fuel cells to produce electricity. This makes it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. ‚Ä¢ H2 is a versatile energy carrier that can be used in a variety of applications, from fuel cells for transportation to power/heat/electricity generation and industrial processes, e.g., fertilizers. ‚Ä¢ H2 can be used as an energy storage medium, allowing excess energy from intermittent renewable sources such as solar and wind to be stored efficiently and used when needed. ‚Ä¢ The development of a H2 infrastructure which encompasses production, storage, and transportation, would create new jobs and economic opportunities in the energy sector. ‚Ä¢ The use of H2 in transportation and other applications can support the efforts reducing GHG emissions, thereby mitigating the impact of climate change.As', ""Hydrogen in industryInterestingly, according to IEA, industry is the second-largest global source of CO2 emissions (related to the energy sector, after the combustion of fossil fuels), exceeding 8.4 Gt in 2020. In particular, three heavy industries, i.e. chemicals (production of primary chemicals i.e., ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, ammonia, and methanol), steel, and cement, account for nearly 60% of all energy consumption and about 72% of all the industrial CO2 emissions. Electrifying industry has been a viable option for years, but it has two challenges. Firstly, the cost of electricity per unit energy (MWh) is higher than fossil fuels, making it less appealing for businesses. Secondly, industrialized countries such as Germany, Poland, the US, and the Netherlands produce electricity with high carbon intensity (>300 g CO2/kWh) , making electrification ineffective in reducing industry's carbon footprint.In densely populated countries like the Netherlands, the electricity grid is near its maximum transport capacity, causing congestion problems. Large off-takers and electricity producers joining the network without a planned expansion worsen the situation. Hence, hydrogen is seen as a potential substitute for electrification. In industry, there are two primary methods for utilizing hydrogen. The first is to generate heat, primarily high-temperature heat. The second is to use it as a chemical reagent in processes such as the Haber-Bosch process for obtaining ammonia.If heat is the main input needed by a particular industry, then in principle hydrogen can directly substitute fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal.

Following the identification of these isomerization conditions, we examined the generality of this reaction and a range of endo-cyclic spiroketals 4e-4j were isomerized in a similar manner (Scheme 3).', 'Lewis Acid Mediated Coupling of Silyloxyallylsilanes and Ortholactones: A Convergent, Fragment-Coupling Approach to Functionalized Spiroketals A convergent, fragment-based coupling approach to the formation of spiroketals has been developed. This approach combines the spiroketal forming step with a fragment coupling utilizing ortholactones as double electrophiles with silyloxyallylsilanes. We also discoved a rapid and regioselective isomerization of the exocyclic sprioketals to their endo-cyclic forms.Spiroketals are an important functional group in many natural products that possess potent medicinal properties. 1 As a result, they have increasingly become targets of interest by the pharmaceutical industry, 2 with ivermectin, 3 and tofogliflozin licensed as therapeutics (Scheme 1A). In many cases, the barrier to advancing the clinical development of complex spirocyclic natural products, such as the spongistatins, 5 is the availability of compound from either natural or synthetic sources. As a result, new modular and convergent methods for spiroketal formations are needed. Many of the commonly utilized methods for spiroketal synthesis rely on generating a linear molecule containing two pendent alcohols with a central ketone, dithiane, or surrogate, followed by cyclization to form the ketal moiety (Scheme 1B). 1e-f,7 While these methods are competent methods to synthesize these molecules, they can lead to long linear-step counts and problems diversifying the structure. Notable developments for the convergent synthesis of spiroketals include anion relay approaches, 8 œÄ-Lewis acidic cyclization of dihydroxyalkynes using gold catalysis, 9 Ferrier-C-H oxidation sequences, 10 chiral', ""acid mediated anomeric stereocontrol, and iridium catalysed enone addition and Hemiketalization/œÄ-allyl cyclizations. We embarked on a research program to develop a convergent strategy whereby the spiroketalization step is also the fragment coupling step. Such an approach could lead to streamlined synthetic routes and facile structural diversification through the development of a more convergent approach. Specifically, we reasoned that ortholactones 1 could be used as bimodal electrophiles, reacting with bis-nucleophilic silyloxy allylsilanes 2 under acidic conditions to directly form a spiroketal group (Scheme 1C). This research was inspired by Mark√≥'s reports that unsubstituted ortholactones could react with silyloxyallylsilanes to form spiroketals (Scheme 1D). The ortholactones they utilized were formed via a strongly alkylative process from Œ¥-valerolactone or Œ≥-butyrolactone, however this reaction is neither functional group tolerant nor general (Scheme 1E). To circumvent these issues, we have developed a palladium catalyzed aerobic Wacker-type reaction of functionalized dihydropyrans and have demonstrated their reactivity towards in situ generated TfOH. The synthesis of benzofused ortholactones can be achieved using orthoquinone methine and electrocyclization techniques. We began examining the reaction of D-glucal derived ortholactone 1a with the simple silyloxyallyl silane 2a. We discovered that a stoichiometric amount of Lewis acid was requires with TMSOTf being optimal producing a moderate yield and mixture of alkene"", 'Scheme 3: Regioselective Isomerization of Exocyclic Olefin SpiroketalsWe were intrigued by the origin of the selectivity in this process. Related systems reported by Mark√≥ observed significant amounts of unselective exo-to endo-isomerization in the absence of an alkoxysilane or low temperatures. This was proposed to be caused by adventitious TfOH protonating the exocyclic alkene leading to a thermodynamic mixture of endoisomers. To investigate this isomerization further, DFT studies were conducted to find the ground-state energies of possible intermediates (Scheme 4). The ground-state energies of the exocyclic (3e), the Œî 2,3 endocyclic (4e) and the Œî 3,4 isomer (5e) were calculated and the two endocyclic isomers (4e and 5e) were found to be within 0.2 kcal/mol with the exocyclic alkene is 3.2 kcal/mol less stable. These results highlight that although the endocyclic isomer is favoured, little if any selectivity would be observed at equilibrium. Additionally, the energy of the protonated alkene intermediate 6e was prohibitively high (+41.4 kcal/mol). We therefore examined a Lewis acid mediated pathway that proceeds via binding to the phenolic oxygen and ring opening. The ensuing oxocarbenium ion 7e (+25.4 kcal/mol) can undergo a triflate mediated isomerization to form the conjugated Œî 2,3 isomer 8e (+10.2 kcal/mol) before ring closure and TMS release to form 4e (-3.2 kcal/mol).

However, a counterexample occurs in R1b. As shown in Figure , the fundamentally excited v3 (a spectator mode in R1b) has significant enhancement effects on the reactivity of R1b at Ec < 5.0 kcal mol -1 . Enhancing the reactivity by exciting a spectator mode was first observed in our previous work on the radical-radical reaction OH + HO2 ‚Üí H2O + O2.We attributed the special mechanism to increased dipole caused by the excited OH, which makes the attraction between OH and HO2 stronger. Recently, Tian et al. reported a novel dynamical behavior that the excited low-frequency umbrella bending mode of ammonia has enhancement effects on reactivity of F( 2 P) + NH3 ‚Üí HF + NH2 reaction, much more efficiently than the highfrequency stretching modes in the entire energy range of Ec, which is related to the stronger attraction induced by the excited bending mode. These unexpected results indicate that the interaction between reactants plays a significant role in the barrierless reaction, and may lead to some unique mode-specific dynamics. Figure shows the interaction potential at different H-O (in HOO') bond distances. Clearly, the attractive interaction increases with the elongation of the H-O (in HOO') bond distance. At RHO = 1.19 √Ö (corresponds to the outer turning point of v3 = 1), the depth of the well is increased by roughly 3.0 and 5.6 kcal mol -1 relative to that at RHO = 1.08 √Ö (v1 = 0) and RHO = 0.97 √Ö (equilibrium bond distance), respectively. The deepening of the RC well increases the chance of capturing the reactants and thus enhances the reactivity of R1b. This can be proved by Figures"", ""Figures S4a and S4cThe initial vibrational states of one reactant HOO' are set as the ground state (GS, all v=0), v1 = 1, v2 = 1, and v3 = 1, respectively, without rotational energies. v1, v2, and v3 represent the vibrational quanta of OO' stretch, bending, and HO stretch motion of HO2, respectively. The other reactant HOO was kept at the ground vibrational state, without rotational energies. Experimentally, R1aand R1b can be distinguished by the oxygen isotopic substitution: HO O + HOO ‚Üí O O + H2O2or HO OH + O2.  Figure presents the potential energies along two representative trajectories: Figure for the direct mechanism and Figure for the complex-forming mechanism. In the direct mechanism, the system undergoes a barrier and the product is formed via a direct hydrogen abstraction mechanism in a very short time. However, in the complex-forming mechanism, the strong attraction between reactants leads to a much longer residence time around RC than that in the direct one, particularly at low Ec. Thus, the system has enough time to adjust the relative orientation between reactants until the reaction occurs. Consequently, the reactivity is higher. In addition, one can see that the energies of PESH are in excellent agreement with the direct ab initio calculations for these points along the two trajectories. Returning to the discussion of mode-specificity, as shown in Figure , the excited HO stretch (v3) of HOO' can significantly enhance the reactivity of R1a in the entire energy range. This is because v3 has a strong coupling with the reaction coordinate at TS1, and depositing energy directly into the"", ""has a strong coupling with the reaction coordinate at TS1, and depositing energy directly into the breaking bond is beneficial for the transfer of the H atom.

Further, the effect of pressure on k1 is significant at low temperatures, but vanishes at temperatures above 600 K.The aforementioned unique temperature-and pressure-dependent behaviors are related to the properties of R1 potential energy surface (PES), which governs the reaction mechanism, kinetics, and dynamics. Indeed, there exists a relatively stable intermediate between the two HO2 radicals, namely the H2O4 intermediate (the HO2 radical dimer) on the triplet state surface, whose energetics and spectroscopic characterization have also been scrutinized extensively by theory and experiment. As shown in Figure , our calculations show that another high-energy pathway via H2OO + O2 leads to the same products H2O2 + O2. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that this reaction path is reported. All these features make the PES of R1 complicated. There is no PES for the title reaction, which limits our understanding for its kinetics and dynamics.The PES, as a central role in physical chemistry, governs the nuclear dynamics that is related to molecular spectroscopy, energy transfer, chemical reactivity, and many other properties.

"the oligomer is mediated by electrostatic interactions between positively charged regions of pMLKL and negatively charged phosphatidylinositol phosphate-rich domains of the membrane. While it seems clear from a number of studies that the membrane association of pMLKL oligomers are important for membrane permeabilization , the mechanism of membrane permeabilization induced by pMLKL oligomers is not completely understood. It is unclear how pMLKL oligomers impact membrane packing, whether other chemical transformations that pMLKL undergo impact membrane association and the presence of the oligomers induces further phosphatidylinositol recruitment to the protein binding site.In parallel to its plasma membrane recruitment via canonical RIPK3/RIPK1 activity during necroptosis, vesicular trafficking of MLKL plays a critical role in its cellular localization.MLKL can mediate endosomal trafficking involving constitutive generation of vesicles that can fuse with lysosomes or the plasma membrane irrespective of phosphorylation by RIPK3 and this phenomenon is further enhanced after phosphorylation. Furthermore, trafficking that results in the removal of pMLKL from the plasma membrane may lead to delay in membrane permeabilization and cell death during necroptosis. Motivated by lipids' role in numerous membrane-related transformations, our laboratory has investigated the role of lipids in necroptosis, specifically during membrane permeabilization.We found that saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulated during necroptosis via activation of fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation.

However, we believe that modifications by C16 FA and VLCFAs contribute to membrane permeabilization differently during necroptosis. We previously showed that VLCFAs interact with membranes and disrupt their integrity in model liposomes and molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the modest increases of VLCFAs during necroptosis, we proposed that the incorporation of VLCFAs into proteins can facilitate their recruitment to defined membrane domains and allow high local concentrations of these lipids at the membrane and perturb membrane integrity . Translocation of pMLKL oligomers to the plasma membrane is driven by electrostatic interactions between the oligomer interface and negatively charged phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)-rich membrane domains. Several PIP species are known to be actively involved in cell signaling cascades, both in endogenous processes as well as in mechanisms of action of viruses and other pathogens. Protein-lipid interactions can alter lipid patterns on the membrane via electrostatic interactions or amino acid insertion into the bilayer. In turn, lateral lipid sorting alters the local mechanical and structural properties of the membrane. Binding of pMLKL oligomers to defined regions of the plasma membrane and further rearrangement of the local lipid distribution at their binding site', 'DISCUSSIONS/CONCLUSIONSThere are multiple signaling pathways that can be activated in response to TNF-Œ± activation. This activation, in the presence of low caspase-8 activity and low activity of the of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis antagonists, results in the activation of necroptotic signaling, activation of RIPK3, and phosphorylation of MLKL in necroptosomes. A recent study illustrated that downstream to its phosphorylation, MLKL translocates to the plasma membrane via Golgi-, actin-and microtubule-dependent trafficking, a new rate-limiting factor in necroptosis. Upon binding to the plasma membrane, pMLKL oligomers induce membrane permeabilization which does not appear to occur via the formation of regularly-structured membrane pores . Based on these observations and others , it is likely that other transformations that pMLKL might undergo contribute to membrane permeabilization or the mechanism that stabilizes pMLKL oligmers at the plasma membrane.We have previously studied the involvement of lipids in necroptosis and showed that saturated VLCFAs were upregulated via activated biosynthesis and mediate membrane permeabilization. Our results suggested that these VLCFAs might be incorporated into proteins during necroptosis and targeted to certain membrane regions as a result of specific protein-bilayer interactions, allowing high local concentrations of these VLCFAs on the plasma membrane. In this work, we investigate the role of VLCFAcylation during necroptosis and present two key findings.First, we show that pMLKL and MLKL are acylated by a representative saturated', 'SIGNIFICANCENecroptosis is a well-characterized form of caspase-independent regulated cell death that is involved in numerous diseases. A hallmark of necroptosis is the membrane permeabilization and rupture that is mediated by mixed linage kinase like protein (MLKL). This membrane rupture is linked to the inflammatory properties of necroptosis and is critical for disease states involving this process. It is established that electrostatic interactions between phosphatidyl inositol phosphates and phosphorylated MLKL (pMLKL) oligomers facilitate the membrane recruitment of pMLKL. In efforts to understand how lipids might contribute to necroptosis, we previously showed that saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulate and that they are functionally involved in this process. Our results also indicated that protein fatty acylation by VLCFAs can be a mechanism by which VLCFAs contribute to this process. Here we define the scope of protein acylation by saturated VLCFAs during necroptosis. First we show that, although there is an overall decrease in acylation, some proteins, including MLKL and pMLKL, are exclusively acylated during necroptosis. Reducing the levels of VLCFAs decreases the membrane recruitment of MLKL and pMLKL and rescues from cell death, suggesting that acylation by VLCFAs contributes to membrane localization of pMLKL and subsequent membrane permeabilization. Acylation of MLKL and pMLKL occur downstream of phosphorylation and oligomerization and appear to be S-linked. Second, we show that disruption of clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway results in a strong rescue in cell viability during necroptosis, likely by removal of pMLKL from the plasma membrane. Altogether, we show for the first time that MLKL and pMLKL can be acylated during necroptosis. We also show that disruption of endocytosis presents a promising strategy to delay membrane permeabilization and cell death during necroptosis', 'key findings.First, we show that pMLKL and MLKL are acylated by a representative saturated VLCFA during necroptosis. We have also shown that the acylation of pMLKL occurs downstream to MLKL phosphorylation and plasma membrane localization, suggesting that the acylation takes place at the plasma membrane. MLKL consists of three domains: the 4-helix-bundle which mediates the interactions with the membrane; the brace domain, and the pseudokinase domain that is phosphorylated by RIPK3. This phosphorylation is critical for membrane recruitment during necroptosis. Recently, it has been suggested that the 4-helix-bundle also contributes to the membrane recruitment and binding, in addition to the phosphorylation of the pseudokinase domain. The 4-helix-bundle domain has two predicted sites for palmitoylation (Cys18 and Cys24, SwissPalm 41 ). Our results suggest that the acylation of pMLKL and MLKL is S-linked and, in part, mediated by ZDHHC5, a member palmitoyl transferase family, indicating the acylation of 4-helix-bundle domain during necroptosis. The integral ZDHHCs undergo an autoacylation step on the cytosolic DHHC motif. The acylated enzyme intermediate then transfers the acyl group to its substrate. As one of the few plasma membrane-localized ZDHHC members, ZDHHC5 mediates the acylation of substrate at the plasma membrane and their plasma membrane recruitment , supporting our findings that of pMLKL and MLKL are acylated at the plasma membrane during necroptosis. Several studies have suggested increased binding of fatty acylated proteins to phosphoinositide lipids. As such, it is possible that the membrane binding of pMLKL is enhanced after its fatty acylation.It is important', 'the plasma membrane and further rearrangement of the local lipid distribution at their binding site allows high concentration of fatty acids that covalently modify pMLKL. Acylation of pMLKL oligomers would allow the local recruitment of VLCFAs to membrane regions that already possess different mechanical and structural properties, which facilitates their membrane disruption action.Second, we define the scope of protein VLCFAcylation during necroptosis using state-ofthe-art quantitative proteomics methods. Overall, we observe a decreased number of proteins are modified by a representative VLCFA during necroptosis. Pathway analysis conducted using proteins that show different levels of VLCFAcylation during necroptosis highlighted the enrichment of proteins belonging to the endocytic and lysosomal pathways. Previous studies have shown that pMLKL can associate with ESCRT proteins and flotillins which is suggested to result in the removal of pMLKL containing regions from the plasma membrane and their degradation. In parallel, flotillin association of pMLKL can result in its removal from the plasma membrane via exosomes. Based on these observations, it is clear that vesicular trafficking is key for maintenance of pMLKL and MLKL at the plasma membrane. We show that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulted in a strong rescue from cell death during necroptosis and decreased the levels of membrane bound pMLKL, whereas the whole cellular MLKL levels remained unchanged, suggesting that the inhibition of endocytosis pathway enhances the removal of pMLKL from the plasma membrane and preserves plasma membrane integrity.

CEs of systematically increasing quality are generated by a modified metadynamics search algorithm and extrapolated to completeness.

Excellent performance is observed with mean deviations <1 cal mol -1 K -1 (about <1-2%) for the total molecular entropy. Even for extremely flexible linear alkanes (C 14 H 30 -C 16 H 34 ), unprecedentedly small errors of about 3 cal mol -1 K -1 are obtained.For 25 typical drug molecules, the conformational entropy depends weakly to strongly on the underlying theory level revealing the complex potential energy surfaces as main source of error.

The main disadvantage of transporting hydrogen via tube trailers is the high cost of transported hydrogen: a single tube trailer can only carry approximately 400 kg of hydrogen, and the limitation lies in the weight of the steel tubes used as well as in the maximum allowable storage pressure in tube trailers (250 bar in the U.S.). One of the proposals that has recently gained significant attention in the hydrogen world is to repurpose the existing natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure. Transporting hydrogen in a network that has already been commissioned would bring significant advantages including 1) a short(er) time horizon for the development of a large-scale hydrogen transport infrastructure, 2) significantly lower capital expenditures (CAPEX) of the transport system for hydrogen, and 3) to bring freedom and certainty to stakeholders on both the consumption and production sides of hydrogen, so that they can develop projects where they deem it best suited to their interests.The retrofitting of the existing natural gas infrastructure to accommodate hydrogen comes with challenges of its own. As a first example, there could be competition with natural gas. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that natural gas will continue to play a role in the global energy mix, both in the lead up to 2050 and potentially beyond. This implies that hydrogen and natural gas could compete with one another for access to the transport infrastructure; in principle, this could be solved by physically blending hydrogen in the natural gas, albeit blending', 'Hydrogen shipping and hydrogen carriersHydrogen transportation is a crucial component in establishing a global hydrogen economy.

Since the surge in interest by US-based car manufacturers to develop hydrogen cars in the 1990's, hydrogen has ever since been promoted as a substitute for gasoline and diesel (and to a lesser extent, for liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, and liquefied natural gas, LNG). As is the case for industrial end-users looking for a substitute to fossil-fuel combustion, hydrogen could be used in an internal combustion engine (ICE), although the vehicle would probably need to be adjusted to fze the hydrogen consumption. The other main applications for extracting energy from hydrogen are proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, considered mainly due to their higher efficiency (~50%) with respect to ICEs (~30%); the operation of PEM fuel cells has already been extensively covered in the literature. There are several kinds of mobility applications including LDVs (light-duty vehicles i.e., passenger cars), MDVs (medium-duty vehicles e.g., vans, public transport buses), and HDVs (heavy-duty vehicles like long-haul trucks and coaches).Regarding LDVs, fuel cell vehicles have existed in the market for longer than a decade, with Japanese and Korean car manufacturers being the most prominent in the market. The main challenge with respect to LDVs is the availability of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs), although the current support for hydrogen-based mobility has accelerated the HRS market, from 330 stations available in 2017 to 540 in 2020.

The development of gas transport infrastructure was historically done in view of two types of gas to deliver: 1) the transport of 'town gas' i.e., gasified coal that consists of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in urban settlements, and 2) the natural gas (either low caloric or high caloric) that holds little to no hydrogen. As such, it is not expected that hydrogen would be compatible with the existing assets in the natural gas transport infrastructure, in particular looking at the transmission grid (in many countries it consists of large-diameter pipelines with a nominal operating pressure upwards of 50 bar) and being mindful of pressure-induced phenomena such as permeation, leaks, or hydrogeninduced embrittlement.There are several past and ongoing projects to prove the extent to which the assets of the natural gas infrastructure can be reused for hydrogen or hydrogen blends and to which extent they would need to be replaced or maintained more often (both of which would result in increased hydrogen transport costs). Research in this topic has converged so far to the knowledge that the existing natural gas infrastructure can carry hydrogen blends up to 20-30% without serious modifications, while blending higher hydrogen percentages as well as carrying 100% hydrogen need more research.""]","['Energy', 'Renewable energy sources']",1678,1,1,0,0.823939121,0,['how']

Consequently, the field of prebiotic chemistry has mostly abandoned the idea of autonomous oligonucleotide replication after von Kiedrowski's seminal work and instead has focused on scenarios where the local environment is modulated allowing for changes in the template:product duplex stability and therefore turnover of the replication cycle. Environmental changes including variations in pH, salt concentrations, viscosity, and temperature have led to cycles of hybridization and dissociation of RNA or DNA duplexes and have been proposed as drivers of prebiotic nucleic acid self-replication. All of these scenarios can be rationalized to some extent based on intrinsic temperature cycles and chemical gradients expected on early Earth. Yet, the question of how fragile oligonucleotides could have sustained these slow cyclical processes for many generations of replication remains unclear, making the question of oligonucleotide self-replication far from settled in any prebiotic theory.A strategy that has also been considered to avoid product inhibition in general nonenzymatic oligonucleotide self-replication, is the introduction of oligonucleotide modifications that destabilize the interaction between the template and the growing complement. For example,"", 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b34"">35, We attributed the facile self-replication to the destabilizing influence of the abasic group on the stability of the product duplex. Moreover, the temperature where exponential self-replication was observed was tunable by varying the stability of the template:fragment complexes through the introduction of mismatches in addition to the destabilizing abasic group, revealing that self-replication was intrinsically linked to the stability of the DNA complexes formed throughout the catalytic cycle. This method of lesioninduced DNA amplification (LIDA) has proven general for amplifying a variety of 18mer sequences, usually requiring the introduction of only one abasic nucleotide into one of the four fragments. Because of its sequence generality, LIDA represents a useful model system for understanding autonomous oligonucleotide self-replication. Nevertheless, our efforts to perform nonenzymatic self-replication using abasic destabilizing groups and rapid chemical ligation methods yielded poor results, suggesting that the enzyme was playing a more substantial role in our rapid self-replicating system beyond simply catalyzing the formation of the phosphodiester linkage.To elucidate the role of the enzyme and identify principles for self-replication that can inform the design of autonomous, nonenzymatic oligonucleotide replication, here we utilize a kinetic model of cross-catalysis to identify the important kinetic and thermodynamic parameters in our ligase chain reaction of abasic site-containing strands. Remarkably, we find that the enzyme influences product inhibition by reducing the stability difference between the intermediate complex and the', 'Self-replication of nucleic acids in the absence of enzymes such as polymerases or ligases represents an important and poorly understood step in the origin of life. In fact, the self-replication of nucleic acids remains strongly hindered by product inhibition, even when enzymes are present.Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self-replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved.Previously, our group reported lesion-induced DNA amplification (LIDA), which is an isothermal ligase chain reaction. It was proposed that the lesion, a destabilizing abasic group, played an important role in reducing product inhibition. However, using abasic groups in non-enzymatic ligation cycles did not yield appreciable amplification. In order to identify the unknown factors that overcome product inhibition in LIDA, we have performed a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the process, employing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and global fitting of PAGE fluorescence data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We found that in the absence of an enzyme, the ligated product binds four to five orders of magnitude more tightly to the template than to the shorter unligated strands of the intermediate complex. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase, this stability gap was reduced by two orders of magnitude, such that the intermediate and product complexes were roughly equal in stability. Thus, the ligase helps overcome product inhibition by reducing the affinity difference between the DNA product duplex and the intermediate complex. Furthermore, kinetic simulations showed that the stability of the intermediate complex, as well as the rate constant of ligation, significantly impacts the rate of self-replication, suggesting that catalysts that stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to', 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b29"">[30] For example, spontaneous ligation by non-heritable 2\'-5\'-linked oligonucleotides was demonstrated to weaken the overall duplex stability. . However, such methods of incorporating destabilizing groups have not been used in a successful self-replication system based on chemical ligation strategies.One area of great success in the quest to identify self-replicating nucleic acids, however, is in ribozymes: RNA sequences on the order of 66-76 nucleotides (nt) with sequence-dependent catalytic function. In 2009, the Joyce lab identified a ribozyme that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds and used it to generate a self-replicating oligonucleotide system that exhibited sigmoidal growth indicative of exponential self-replication. Yet these replicating systems are not a model of general oligonucleotide replication as they require specific RNA sequences to confer this catalytic property. Interestingly, the most facile replicators in the selfreplicating ribozyme system did have destabilizing modifications between the template and the complementary fragments in the form of a U:G wobble pair. These results suggested that destabilizing mismatches could facilitate replication.Previously our lab discovered an isothermal ligase chain reaction that exhibited rapid, exponential amplification of 18mer sequences using a common DNA ligase and four fragment sequences, one of which contained a model abasic lesion in place of a complementary nucleotide at the 5\'-phosphate terminus (Figure ).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSIn this contribution, we presented the implementation of the Davidson algorithm and its variational variant within the quantum version of EOM-CC for computing electronically excited states. We tested the method, named qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson and qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson/Variational, on four systems: H 2 /6-31G, H 4 /STO-3G, LiH/STO-3G, and H 2 O/STO-3G(FC) showing good agreements with the energies obtained from EOM-VQE .The Davidson implementation of the qEOM-UCCSD algorithm provides the advantage over the qEOM and EOM-VQE by reducing the working Hilbert space significantly. The classic Davidson method iteratively interacts with the outcome from the quantum devices and provides feedback to grow the ansatz (vector space) to prepare desired quantum states.The implementation provides several advantages compared to the currently available excitedstate methods in quantum computing. First, qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson significantly reduces the computational demand for classical diagonalization step, because the dimension of the resulting subspace Hamiltonian only spanned by a few guess vectors. In the case of its variational variant, the Davidson algorithm provides the certain electronic configurations that are expected to contribute to the target excited states. Therefore, it introduces a significantly smaller number of variational parameters resulting in a significantly reduced searching space.In addition, similarly to the classical variant, the presented Davidson algorithm produces the excited state of the desired spatial or spin symmetry (in the case of the closed-shell references). The qEOM-UCCSD/Davidson can target the specific group of transitions by defining suitable subspace vectors and can be extended to target higher-energy states or specific transitions . Apart from the advantages of using', 'ground-state energies. Many applications (e.g., spectroscopy, photochemistry), require going beyond ground-state calculations and computing excited states. The development of quantum algorithms for molecular excited states is more challenging compared to the ground-state algorithms. The existing quantum algorithms for excited states often require a large number of qubits and gate operations, which precludes their application to larger systems. This is because the excited states often have more complex wavefunctions (open-shell, multi-configurational) even when the corresponding ground states are well behaved. Furthermore, in contrast to the ground state (which is unique in the sense that it is the lowest-energy state), there are many excited states, so the quantum algorithms should be capable of targeting a specific state (or states)e.g., the lowest energy states or states in a particular energy range, states of a particular symmetry/spin, states of a particular character, etc.The success of the VQE algorithm for ground-state calculations has inspired extensions to excited states, leading to variational quantum deflation (VQD) , subspace-search VQE (SSVQE) , and other algorithms . The underlying framework of all VQE-based methods is variational principle. The VQE-based methods for excited states employ supplementary constraints, so that the resulting algorithms look for a minimum-energy state orthogonal to the previously computed states. For example, the central element of VQD is the penalty terms in the cost function (which is subject to minimization). The penalty terms quantify the overlap between the previously obtained solutions and the current target state. The minimization', 'ansatz . UCC framework is Hermitian, provides an upper bound for the energy, and is size extensive by construction.However, the price paid for the variational bound is that the originally proposed qEOM ansatz does not satisfy the killer condition that ensures the ground-state cannot be de-excited. Mukherjee and co-workers proposed a unitary transformation of the EOM projection operators to address the killer condition issue of the UCC theory . Asthana et al. have implemented this technique on quantum devices. The algorithm, named EOM-VQE , yields more accurate excitation energies (EEs), ionization potentials (IPs), and electron affinities (EAs) than originally proposed qEOM .The qEOM procedure leverages classical and quantum computing resources. Specifically, the Hamiltonian matrix is measured on a quantum computer within a given many-electron basis, and the resulting matrix is subsequently diagonalized on a classical computer. Although the measurement processes of the Hamiltonian can potentially benefit from quantum architecture, for the entire calculation to be effective, one also needs a cost-efficient algorithm for the diagonalization step done on a classical computer. In classical electronic structure calculations, the diagonalization is accomplished through iterative determination of only a few eigenvalues using the Davidson algorithm <ref', 'on a quantum device and then solves the eigenvalue problem of Eq. ( ) on a classical computer. Thus, qEOM also needs classical machines to diagonalize the measured matrix. The number of matrix elements to measure on quantum computers and the dimension of the matrix to diagonalize on classical computers depend on the level of correlation treatment and the one-electron basis set. By restricting the excitation levels to singles and doubles, the quantum computer is required to measure about N ‚àº n occ √ó n vir + n 2 occ √ó n 2 vir matrix elements and the classical computer is required to diagonalize N √ó N matrix, which scales as O(N 3 ). Although the dimension of the matrix M can considerably be reduced by utilizing the sparsity and symmetries of the Hamiltonian, the scaling quickly reaches the intractable regime as the system size increases.Eqs. ( ) and (22), which are the working equation of qEOM with the self-consistent manifold operator, are the same as in the standard EOM-CC method except for the form of the effective Hamiltonian. In the standard EOM-CC calculation, we iteratively determine only a few eigenvalues using the Davidson algorithm instead of explicit diagonalization of the entire matrix M . Here, we present the implementation of this idea within the qEOM method (we focus on the standard Davidson algorithm for low-lying states, but it can be extended to compute interior states or states of a particular character ).In order to compute J excited states, qEOM-UCC/Davidson starts with generating a set of appropriate L orthonormal guess vectors, {|b i ‚ü©} L‚â•J i=1 .

If this is really the case for very flexible molecules (e.g. long alkanes) can be tested by comparison of computed and experimental entropies and heat capacities (see Sec. 4.2 and 4.3). Note that our approach works with any (on-the-fly computed) PES and hence, at least in principle, the errors introduced by the underlying method for the PES and the other approximations to the entropy problem could be decomposed.The CREST algorithms were originally developed to generate rotamer containing ensembles and the related nuclei-exchange information for the simulation of NMR spectra . Hence, it seems straightforward not only to identify rotamers, but to extend the algorithm to automatically compute the proper degeneracy number g i . However, as mentioned above, conformer ensembles (CE) must be free from the indistinguishable rotamers to be compatible with entropy calculations. Therefore, g i are treated as unity in the usual case.The only exception here are symmetrical molecules that can form ""enantiomeric"" (i.e., in principle distinguishable) conformers through rotation of bonds. A typical case is the gauche conformer of n-butane. These geometrical enantiomers are degenerate and would be falsely classified as rotamers in our previous implementation. Effectively, this introduces a factor of g i = {1, 2} instead of g i in the degeneracy, depending on if the formation of a geometrical enantiomer is possible.

The first set of structures, which always consists of 36 structures, is used as input for further metadynamic simulations. The other set consists out of a number of structures that depends on the molecular flexibility and current ensemble size. This second ensemble is used to generate a global bias potential in the metadynamics simulations and, in contrast to the initial MTD simulation, is not updated with new bias structures. The idea here is to apply this new unchanged bias similar to a global potential used in classical umbrella sampling 72 or basin-hopping algorithms 73,74 to efficiently block entire energy basins of the PES and direct the conformational search to new minima. For better differentiation, this is referred to as static metadynamics simulation (sMTD). The ensemble obtained by sMTD is merged with the previous ensemble and a preliminary conformational entropy S conf,est is determined. If no change (within a 2 % threshold) in S conf,est"", 'Algorithmic and technical detailsThe conformational entropy calculation as described above is performed with the recently published CREST program. A special run type was implemented for this purpose, where the focus is set to an extensive sampling around the global and low-lying local minima.Ideally the calculation of S conf should be conducted from the already known global minimum conformer, e.g., obtained from another conformational search with default settings in CREST. The enantiomer degenaracy number g i is obtained automatically as described in detail the Supporting Information. For the msRRHO part, any quantum chemical method or even force-fields can be applied. Here, we use the composite DFT method B97-3c and the well-known B3LYP-D3 functional in a standard def2-TZVP basis.  Note that for large systems step two could in principle also be conducted at a low theory level (SQM or FF). However, because step three is usually the computational bottleneck, it is recommended to take S msRRHO from a more accurate DFT treatment. In general, this partitioning allows systematic improvements of the scheme because the different contributions can in principle be calculated at any level of theory.If no low-lying conformers (relative energy <1-2 kcal/mol at ambient temperature) are found in the first step, the entropy run is not necessary and the plain S msRRHO value can be taken.

To create an initial structural ensemble, 24 metadynamics (MTD) simulations are conducted with several different bias parameters as in the default CREST runtype. The structural ensemble obtained from this step is later used as the reference to calculate S conf (0) (see Eq. 15). Structures are sorted according to their relative energy, structural Cartesian RMSD, and rotational constants to distinguish between unique conformers and degenerate rotamers, as described in Ref.56. conf , an extrapolation as described in Sec. 3.1 is conducted. This new algorithm in CREST can also be used for normal conformer search with the keyword --v4. with the respective DFT methods. In such cases, we suggest to use the S msRRHO value obtained for the lowest DFT conformer and corresponding S conf from the GFN ensemble. If the lowest GFN and DFT conformer structures agree qualitatively, this approximation seems to be reasonable according to our experience.A problem may appear if the rather approximate PES used in CREST (here GFN2-xTBor GFN-FF) is substantially different from the DFT PES (here B97-3c or B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP).

As predicted by mechanical considerations of the H4FBCDC ligand, the metal-organic framework DUT-140(Cu) shows intrinsic flexibility as well as negative gas adsorption property with an ŒînNGA = 5.45 mmol/g. The contraction of the opphase can be induced by adsorption of hydrocarbons like methane or butane as well as carbon dioxide. Adsorption experiments also confirm the assumption that the use of the H4FBCDC linker leads to a more rigid network since the adsorption of nitrogen does not trigger the phase transformation.UV/Vis investigations of DUT-140(Cu) showed a distinct change in the absorption spectrum which could be attributed to an excitation from the carbazole moiety to the fluorenone part by DFT calculations. Since this excitation is highly affected by the deformation of the linker, it can be concluded that the fluorescence spectrum also should change under the given conditions due to the structural transformation.The fluorescence properties of the fluorescent linker could be unveiled by an exchange of the metal node to a zinc paddlewheel. However, the stiffening of the metal-organic framework did not lead to the desired increased resistance to desolvation stress for DUT-140(Zn), indicating the metal node to be the main limiting factor, leading to amorphization during desolvation in such highly porous framework materials, even under mild supercritical conditions.In situ fluorescence studies provide clear evidence that a fluorescence change is caused by structural decomposition of the metal-organic framework and revealed the importance of the fine interplay of linker rigidity and metal node stability for the investigation of structural contraction by solvent desorption.Overall, fluorenone moieties are valuable functional building blocks for the detection of structural', 'Figure 2 .2Figure 2.

The ET rate from the Au electrode to the covalently bound EtnFc across the SAM has been determined using chronoamperometry. Chronoamperometry is a very useful tool for the determination of apparent ET rate (kapp) from an electrode to a redox active species bound to various SAMs modified electrode.

The CA current decay comprises two types of processes, one for the overall capacitive current decay and the other is due to the faradaic current decay of the attached redox active moiety. The charging current decays very much faster than the faradaic current. This helps to determine the kapp of ET from the electrode to the attached redox active species by simply choosing the appropriate time scale of decay. The plot of Ln(i) vs. time is linear and its slope yields the value of kapp. Chronoamperograms of N3C11SH-C8SH SAM-modified Au electrodes demonstrate a complete decay of charging currents within 0.2 ms time scale (Fig. ) whereas the faradaic currents decay completely at 7.5 ms when EtnFc covalently bound to it (Fig. ).

The kET shows a normal H/D isotope effect in the case of N3C11SH-C8SH/N3C16SH-C12SH but is inverse in the case of N3C16SH-C16SH.The heterogeneous ET rate constant at zero overpotential (the standard rate constant, k 0 ) from the electrode to a redox active species either chemically bound or adsorbed onto it can also be determined by Laviron's approach. This method is mainly based on Butler-Volmer approach with the separation between cathodic and anodic peak potential (\uf044Ep) at different scan rates (\uf06e) as the only experimental requirement. Transfer coefficient (\uf061) is an important parameter used in this approach which indicates the symmetry of the energy barrier during the redox process. The value of \uf061 is 0.5 for the ideal case but may vary from 0.5.

UCC framework is Hermitian, provides an upper bound for the energy, and is size extensive by construction.However, the price paid for the variational bound is that the originally proposed qEOM ansatz does not satisfy the killer condition that ensures the ground-state cannot be de-excited. Mukherjee and co-workers proposed a unitary transformation of the EOM projection operators to address the killer condition issue of the UCC theory . Asthana et al. have implemented this technique on quantum devices. The algorithm, named EOM-VQE , yields more accurate excitation energies (EEs), ionization potentials (IPs), and electron affinities (EAs) than originally proposed qEOM .The qEOM procedure leverages classical and quantum computing resources. Specifically, the Hamiltonian matrix is measured on a quantum computer within a given many-electron basis, and the resulting matrix is subsequently diagonalized on a classical computer. Although the measurement processes of the Hamiltonian can potentially benefit from quantum architecture, for the entire calculation to be effective, one also needs a cost-efficient algorithm for the diagonalization step done on a classical computer.

For SCN -(aq), the peak of the VIE distribution is also exactly the same when the data are restricted to the interfacial region, no matter how narrowly defined, whereas for I -(aq) the interfacial VIE peak is shifted to 0.2 eV lower in energy in the interfacial region, for each of the three aforementioned definitions of the interfacial layer. That shift, however, is smaller than the width of either the bulk or the interfacial VIE distribution. We therefore conclude that interfacial VIE distributions are essentially indistinguishable from their bulk counterparts, for both I -(aq) and SCN -(aq).C. Analysis of Short-Range Structure. We have documented that two solvation shells of explicit water molecules is enough to provide converged VIEs when appropriate boundary conditions are employed, and that VIEs computed for anions at the air/water interface differ from their bulk counterparts (if at all) by a shift that is comparable to (or smaller than) the inhomogeneous broadening of the VIE distribution. This implies that any shift in the VIE for X -(aq) between the bulk and interfacial environments is hardly distinguishable from thermal fluctuations. Taken together with the rapid convergence of the VIE with respect to explicit water, this would seem to suggest that the short-range ion-water hydrogen bonding around X -(aq) might not be that different at the air/water interface as compared to the bulk aqueous environment. That hypothesis is explored in this section, by examining various structural parameters extracted from the MD simulations.Figure shows the time evolution of', ""data from Fig. are replotted as twodimensional scatter plots, comparing the distributions of d GDS and the VIE (Fig. ), as well as n HB versus VIE (Fig. ). In the former case, there is a cluster of data near d GDS = 0, consistent with the surface propensity of I -(aq), however the corresponding VIEs are spread over a range that is not dissimilar from the spread of the entire data set. This is consistent with the similarity between bulk and interfacial VIE distributions that was documented in Fig. . It is difficult to see any correlations at all in the n HB versus VIE data. While transient fluctuations in the hydrogen-bond network are no doubt the origin of the inhomogeneous broadening of the VIE distribution, it is not so simple as saying that fewer hydrogen bonds to the ion implies a larger or smaller VIE, especially with a metric that discretizes the ion's hydra- tion shell into an integer number of hydrogen bonds.In previous MD simulations of halide ions A -(aq) at the air/water interface, Jungwirth and Tobias reported that the larger halides exhibit distinctive differences in terms of how their ion-water hydrogen bonds are oriented with respect to the surface normal, when compared to the same ions in bulk water. In that work, orientation with respect to the surface normal vector r ‚ä• was measured in terms of the angle it makes with r XO , examiningcos Œò AO‚ä• = r AO ‚Ä¢ r ‚ä• r AO ‚Ä¢ r ‚ä• .We have analyzed our I -(aq) and SCN -(aq) simulations in the same way, examining the distribution of cos( ŒòAO‚ä• ), where ŒòAO‚ä• denotes the average value of Œò AO‚ä• considering each of the n HB anion-oxygen vectors r AO around the ion.

Values reported in Table represent averages over the entire simulation cell, and certain ions (such as NO - 3 ) move readily between the bulk-like interior of the slab and the air/water interface. As such, it is not obvious which (if any) of the theoretical values should be compared directly to experiment, for a given ion, although this ambiguity is largely mitigated by the close agreement between isotropic and slab VIEs. Agreement with experiment is comparable to the best available periodic DFT calculations, which reported a mean absolute error of 0.1 eV using range-separated hybrid functionals. The present calculations, however, are free of issues related to the use of periodic electronic structure for ionization or redox processes. Having validated the accuracy of our computational protocol with respect to experimental data, we next turn to the most interesting aspect of the calculations, namely, the similarity between VIEs computed for isotropic versus slab simulations, for the same ion.

"is not just protein-protein interactions that determine structure, but also interactions with the water model.

Consistent with the QUBE small molecule approach, every atom in the protein is assigned bespoke non-bonded parameters derived from the quantum mechanical electron density. To model polarization effects in the condensed phase, the electron density is computed first in vacuum, then using an implicit solvent model with a dielectric constant of 80. The iPol approach used in AMBER ff15ipq is then employed, with all non-bonded parameters set halfway between their vacuum and condensed phase values. The purpose of this approach, as well as overcoming issues associated with closing of the electronic band gap in large system sizes, is to account for electrostatics and induction in the condensed phase in an effective manner using a fixed point charge force field. Typical computational requirements for a QM calculation on a small protein (‚âà 1000 atoms) are approximately 2000 cpuhrs. In order to provide a consistent and computationally efficient approach to assigning the non-bonded parameters, we recommend minimizing the experimental structure using a standard transferable force field in explicit water prior to the DFT calculation.

Following non-bonded parameter assignment, bond, angle and torsion parameters were assigned as described in Section 2 based', 'Development and Validation of the QUBE Protein Force Field Molecular mechanics force field parameters for macromolecules, such as proteins, are traditionally fit to reproduce experimental properties of small molecules, and thus they neglect system-specific polarization. In this paper, we introduce a complete protein force field that is designed to be compatible with the QUantum mechanical BEspoke (QUBE) force field by deriving non-bonded parameters directly from the electron density of the specific protein under study. The main backbone and sidechain protein torsional parameters are re-derived in this work by fitting to quantum mechanical dihedral scans for compatibility with QUBE non-bonded parameters. Software is provided for the preparation of QUBE input files. The accuracy of the new force field, and the derived torsional parameters, are tested by comparing the conformational preferences of a range of peptides and proteins with experimental measurements. Accurate backbone and sidechain conformations are obtained in molecular dynamics simulations of dipeptides, with NMR J coupling errors comparable to the widely-used OPLS force field. In simulations of five folded proteins, the secondary structure is generally retained and the NMR J coupling errors are similar to standard transferable force fields, although some loss of the experimental structure is observed in certain regions of the proteins. With several avenues for further development, the use of system-specific nonbonded force field parameters is a promising approach for next-generation simulations of biological molecules.', 'which would be problematic if the charges show strong conformation dependence. However, Manz and Sholl have demonstrated that DDEC charges are transferable between different conformations of a molecule (as measured by their ability to recreate the QM electrostatic potential), and they conclude that the charges are suitable for the construction of flexible force fields. Furthermore, it should be noted that atoms-in-molecule electron density partitioning lends itself naturally to the derivation of both off-site charges to model electron anisotropy (such as lone pairs and œÉ-holes) and atomic polarizabilities, though we have not yet investigated a fully polarizable force field.In keeping with our goal of deriving force field parameters directly from QM, rather than fitting to experiment, we have supplemented the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameters with harmonic bond and angle parameters derived directly from the QM Hessian matrix. There are a number of methods available for deriving bonded parameters from the QM Hessian matrix, but our recent adaptation of the Seminario method (which we name the modified Seminario method) is conceptually quite straightforward whilst yielding parameters that reproduce QM vibrational frequencies with a mean unsigned error of 49 cm -1 , below that of OPLS (59 cm -1 ). Collectively, we have named these methods the QUantum mechanical BEspoke (QUBE) force field.

While we have previously shown that DDEC charges are not too dependent on small conformation changes, 28 further investigation is needed to establish the utility of QUBE for protein folding simulations.Hence, although we have outlined our roadmap to future improvements, a natural question is: where can the QUBE protein force field be used now (especially given the higher cost of parameterization compared to transferable force fields)? Importantly, it has been shown previously that the use of system-specific force field charges leads to improvements in binding energetics of small molecules, and reproduction of the QM electrostatic potential for both small molecules 27 and proteins. Therefore, although simulated protein backbone dynamics is an important test, we envisage the QUBE small molecule and protein force field being particularly important for the study of intermolecular interactions in the condensed phase.Indeed, QUBE was originally developed to provide, by construction, a compatible protein and small molecule force field for computer-aided drug design, where an accurate surface electrostatic potential of the protein is crucial. In this regard, the absolute binding free energies between the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme and six benzene analogs have been recently computed using QUBE with a mean unsigned error of 0.85 kcal/mol, which compares very favorably with OPLS-AA/M (1.26 kcal/mol).

These results are competitive with standard transferable force fields, which have been extensively fit to properties such as these.To achieve our goal of employing the QUBE force field in computer-aided drug design applications, we require a compatible protein force field. Since the non-bonded parametrization strategy employed in QUBE is very different to that used in the standard biomolecular force fields (e.g. AMBER, OPLS, CHARMM), there is no reason to believe that they are compatible. However, by implementing the atoms-in-molecule non-bonded parameter derivation methods in the ONETEP linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) software, we have shown that it is feasible to derive these charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for entire proteins.

These non-bonded terms were used here alongside libraries of (non-bespoke) bond and angle parameters, derived using the modified Seminario method, and newly reparametrized torsional terms.We have shown here that using system-specific non-bonded force field parameters can result in accurate conformational preferences for short peptides. Rotamer populations and simulated J couplings for the dipeptide molecules are in good agreement with experimental data and compare favorably with the latest OPLS force field. For longer peptide molecules, the problems associated with fitting torsional parameters to a system-specific force field became more apparent. Using regularization in the fitting process was shown to overcome these issues and resulted in a J coupling error of just 0.90 ¬± 0.03 for the alanine pentapeptide. Further work investigating disordered peptides will ascertain how general this fix is.The accuracy of the peptide simulations supports the use of our non-bonded and modified Seminario bonded parametrization strategies.

The computed relative binding free energy of indole and benzofuran to the lysozyme protein using the environment-specific force fields (-0.4 kcal/mol) was in excellent agreement with experiment (-0.6 kcal/mol), and was substantially more accurate than standard force fields (-2.4 kcal/mol). However, the force field was in need of further development as the bespoke non-bonded terms were used in combination with standard OPLS-AA bonded parameters.The use of these parameters potentially limits the accuracy of the force field due to interdependency between the bonded terms, particularly the torsional parameters, and the non-bonded components of the force field. This issue is the subject of the current paper.In standard transferable force fields, the torsional component is typically parameterized using QM dihedral energy scans, with the difference between analogous MM and QM energy scans minimized by fitting the torsional parameters.

Typical computational requirements for a QM calculation on a small protein (‚âà 1000 atoms) are approximately 2000 cpuhrs. In order to provide a consistent and computationally efficient approach to assigning the non-bonded parameters, we recommend minimizing the experimental structure using a standard transferable force field in explicit water prior to the DFT calculation.

In addition to the singly excited states of covalent character, there are also higher-lying doubly excited states of covalent character, as well as the manifold of the singly and doubly excited ionic states.In a hypermetallic molecule of the ACCA type, one of the two valence electrons of each alkaline earth metals is transferred to the linker, giving rise to strongly ionic AC bonds and two unpaired electrons, each localized at the respective metal center, making ACCA analogous to the two alkali metals separated by a large distance. Below we examine the electronic structure of ACCH and ACCA with varied metal (A = Mg, Ca, Sr) and compare with electronic structure of Li 2 .Considering electronic structure of ACCH, in the ground X 2 Œ£ + state the unpaired electron is localized at the metal occupying the hybridized sœÉ-pœÉ orbital (see a representative example of the Dyson orbitals of MgCCH in Figure ). Upon excitation to the higher 1 2 Œ† and 2 2 Œ£ + states, the electron remains localized at the metal and occupies the hybridized pœÄ-dœÄ and pœÉdœÉ orbitals, respectively. The orbital hybridization arises due to the presence of the negatively charged ligand and can be reproduced by perturbatively adding a point-charge potential to the Hamiltonian of a hydrogen-like atom .While the electron remains largely localized at the metal, the minor leakage to the ligand is always present, leading to slightly non-diagonal', 'The strength of the interaction between the cycling centers can be tuned by using the linkers of varied length (Figure ). One should also keep in mind that the nature of the linker directly impacts the electronic structure of the molecule. In this context, lessons learned from studies of diradicals and polyradicals provide valuable insights . For example, the interplay between the (direct) through-space interaction between the two electrons and (indirect) through-bond interaction can strongly affect the electronic structure of the molecule. In a representative example of the para-benzene diradical a considerable through-bond interaction flips the ordering of the frontier orbitals relative to the one expected on the basis of through-space interactions and the formally anti-bonding orbital becomes lower in energy than the bonding one .In this Letter, we investigate the electronic structure of the hypermetallic molecules with two cycling centers connected by the acetyl linker: ACCB, where A and B are either the same or different alkaline earth metals (A, B = Mg, Ca, Sr). The main focus is on the strength of the interaction between the two unpaired electrons and how this interaction manifests itself in the underlying electronic structure and experimental observables, such as excitation energies, singlet-triplet energy gaps, excitonic splittings, and oscillator strengths. We also analyze underlying wavefunctions in terms of the number of effectively unpaired electrons and the effective number of entangled states.The main challenge in the first-principle calculations of this class of systems lies in their strong diradical character originating from the near-degeneracies of the frontier', 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b53"">54 .Finally, as in the case of Li 2 , we consider natural orbitals as a tool to interpret the electronic structures of ACCAs. Figure shows two frontier natural orbitals and their occupations for the ground X 1 Œ£ + g state of MgCCMg; natural orbitals of CaCCCa and SrCCSr are shown in Figure in the SI. In all three molecules, the antibonding natural orbital has a higher occupation number than the bonding orbital in contrast to the case of Li 2 , where, in the agreement with the molecular orbital theory, the bonding natural orbital lies below the antibonding orbital. Such an effect of the flipped orbital ordering has been observed in systems where the (indirect) through-bond interaction between electrons dominates a weak (direct) through-space interaction; for example, it is clearly seen in para-benzyne . Indeed, orbital hybridization induced by the negatively charged linker directs the distribution of the two electrons away from each other, thus minimizing the orbital overlap and through-space interaction.The occupation numbers in all three ACCAs are very close to those of a perfectly diradical wavefunction (i.e., n 1 = n 2 = 1) and, correspondingly, the Head-Gordon\'s indices are close to the limiting value of 2 (Table in SI). The observed small deviations from the perfect diradical values reflect that the interaction between two unpaired electrons is weak but is not negligible. As such, the electronic wavefunction of the X 1 Œ£ + g state in all three ACCA molecules is dominated by the covalent configuration with a small contribution from the ionic (chargeresonance) configuration. In contrast, the X 3 Œ£ + u state is, as expected, of a pure covalent character with the n u,nl = 2.00.

Additional insight can be gained from the analysis of the underlying wave-functions , such as shapes and occupations of natural frontier orbitals and the effective number of unpaired electrons.

The definition of the effective number of unpaired electrons is grounded in the concept of natural orbitals . Natural orbitals are the eigenstates of the one-particle reduced density matrix, with the eigenvalues n i that are non-negative, less than 2, and add up to the total number of electrons; hence, they can be interpreted as orbital occupations. That is, natural orbitals with occupations close to 2 can be described as doubly occupied orbitals, those with small occupation numbers can be described as unoccupied orbitals, and orbitals with noticeable fractional occupations can be described as natural frontier orbitals.

Yet, in spite of several decades of investigations, its intimate working mechanisms still remain elusive. In particular, the behavior of the acid proton and its localization -either on the molecule or on the surfaceare still open issues. By modeling the adsorption of formic acid on top of regular (101) anatase TiO 2 surfaces, we found that, in the 0 K limit, the acid proton is shared between a carboxylic oxygen and a surface oxygen. In this regime, the proton behavior is mainly governed by quantum delocalization effects in a single potential well. Nonetheless, as temperature is raised to room conditions, simulations evidenced a rapid ""classical"" shuttling of the proton due to the onset of a two-wells free energy profile separated by a free energy barrier of the order of kT. This picture, supported by the agreement between simulated and experimental IR spectra, shows that the titania surface acts like a protecting group for the carboxylic acid functionality. Such a conceptual insight might help rationalize the chemical processes of carboxylic species on TiO 2 surfaces.', 'Figure ). Hence, taken together, our results suggest that a ""classic"" proton-shuttling model may be eligible to describe the HCOOH adsorption on defect-free portions of anatase TiO 2 {101} surfaces at room temperature. A third remark, which is more chemical in nature, is that both the quantum and the classical picture predict that HCOOH on top of TiO 2 anatase is essentially a neutral moiety (see Bader charges in Table in the SI) with its acid functionality ""protected"" by the surface, owing to the presence of a strong hydrogen bond. Thus, its reactivity may be substantially different from that of a fully-dissociated formic acid -i.e. an adsorbed negatively charged formate and a Br√∏nsted acid surface site formed upon protonation of TiO 2 (101) anatase. Indeed, the ""protecting-group"" role of the surface highlighted by our study might explain, for example, why, carboxylic acids pre-adsorbed on TiO 2 nanoparticles undergo amidation instead of salt formation upon addition of amines. Conclusions By using first principles approaches we propose a model for the adsorption of light carboxylic acids on regular {101} surfaces of TiO 2 -anatase: the adsorbate is bound to a Ti-Lewis acid centre via a carboxyl oxygen, and to a surface oxygen via a ""floating"" proton, with the surface acting like a protecting group for the carboxylic acid functionality, owing to the presence of a short hydrogen bond (HB). This model accounts for the peculiar reactivity of adsorbed carboxylic acids upon addition of amines. The novelty of this picture, which is consistent with spectroscopic experiments, is a dynamical model of the adsorbed moiety, involving either a rapid proton shuttling between a carboxylic and a surface oxygen, or a proton sharing between these two atoms due to quantum delocalization. Whereas the quantum mechanical picture (proton sharing)', 'Investigation of quantum effectsSo far we have discussed the thermal behavior of HCOOH on TiO 2 anatase in a purely classical mechanics frame, which highlighted a double well potential leading to a proton-shuttling mechanism. Actually it is well known that formic acid protons -and more in general proton transfer events -can be strongly influenced by quantum effects, in particular by zero point energies (zpe). To gather insight on such issue, we have optimized the structure of the activated complex at the PBE level (see SI for details).The harmonic frequency involving the ""shared"" proton resulted 1676 cm -1 (with an O s -O f distance of 2.395 √Ö), not surprisingly much lower than the wavenumbers obtained for the double well potential protonshuttling mechanism. By adding to the energy of the three optimized configurations the zpe, the barrier disappears, (see Figure ) indicating that the quantum approach predicts a shared-proton in a single-well at 0 K. Yet the energy differences still remain below the 1 kcal/mol, even upon inclusion of the zpe contribution. This result indicates that, in order to have a clear-cut answer to the question as to whether the molecule-to-surface proton transfer is governed by a single-well or a double-well potential, one should rest on electronic-structure calculations assuring at least 0.1 kcal/mol accuracy. Such a level of accuracy not only is beyond current DFT approximations, but, due to the size of the system, it is also not', 'Free energy profilesAs the molecule-surface proton-shuttling could be relevant for the overall reactivity of HCOOH on anatase, we calculated the free energy path for this process at 50 K and 300 K (Figure , including also data at 0 K, see below). In both cases we found two free energy minima, corresponding to the dissociated (Figure ) and nondissociated (Figure ) forms. In Figure , the same profiles are reported in units of kT as well. It emerges that at room temperature the shuttling barrier is of the order of kT, hence the shuttling process should be thermally accessible. Indeed, temperature does affect quantitatively the free energy profile: while at 50 K we obtain a free energy barrier of 0.84 kcal/mol, at 300 K the barrier is 1.17 kcal/mol. However, in terms of kT, the barrier amounts to 2.0 kT at 300K while it raises to 8.5 kT at 50 K: hence, overall the shuttling process would be favored upon increasing the temperature. Also, temperature copes to reduce the thermodynamic stability difference between the dissociated and undissociated forms (which is 6.4 kT at 50 K and 0.9 kT at 300 K).Starting from relevant configurations of the 50 K free energy profile, we calculated energy minima (at 0 K) by geometry optimizations at different levels of theory. At the PBE level we found modest energy differences between the two structures, with a preference for the undissociated HCOOH by 0.67 kcal/mol and a (0 K) barrier of 0.75 kcal/mol. We checked also for the effect of dispersion interactions by augmenting the PBE functional with the Grimme D2 correction , in this case the undissociated form is more stable by 0.48 kcal/mol and the shuttling barrier amounts', 'not only is beyond current DFT approximations, but, due to the size of the system, it is also not affordable via state-of-the-art wavefunction-based approaches.Nonetheless, although the single vs double-well issue still remains open, we gathered useful chemical insight on this system. A first remark is that the harmonic frequency associated to the optimized structure of the quantum mechanical minimum (1676 cm -1 ) falls in the region of strong hydrogen bonds -i.e., below the CH stretching modes and very close to the highest O-C-O mode of adsorbed HCOOH, as found for the ""classic"" proton shuttling at room-temperature (Figure ). Such a piece of information may help experimentalists in identifying shared or shuttling protons from the presence of low-wavenumber (and presumably very broad and weak) ŒΩ(OH) signals in vibrational spectra of adsorbed carboxylic acids. This model might explain also the reported STM acid proton ""invisibility"", as the carboxylate group conceals the proton from the tip. Secondly, earlier studies on nuclear quantum effects in molecular systems showed that, while quantum fluctuations and zero point motion dominate at very low temperature, the thermally activated (""classical"") behavior should prevail at room temperature. To explore this hypothesis, we simulated, at room temperature conditions, the adsorption of a species less sensitive than HCOOH to quantum delocalization effects : deuterated formic acid (DCOOD). Indeed, the 300 K simulation with deuterated formic acid revealed that even the acid deuteron shuttles between a TiO 2 surface oxygen (O s )and the carboxylic oxygen O f (See SI, Figure ).

Until recently aryl bromides and iodides were typically employed as electrophiles rather than the less reactive but abundant aryl chlorides. In comparison to aryl (pseudo)halides, alkenyl electrophiles have been much less systematically explored. One of the disadvantages of halides is the synthesis of not commercially available substrates, which may require multiple steps , forcing reaction conditions 10 restricting the functional group tolerance, as well as toxic chemicals (e.g. CCl4, 11 PCl5 12 ). In contrast, aryl and alkenyl triflates, representatives of pseudohalides, can easily be synthesized in a simple one step procedure from phenols and ketones, rendering them excellent alternative electrophiles. Phenols and ketones are both abundant, available as well as low-cost, and thus attractive building blocks, especially for more complex pharmaceutically active compounds.

Regarding alkenyl electrophiles, only few reports were dedicated to the palladium catalyzed C-S coupling of tosylates 8f and triflates, 8e while nickel catalysed couplings are even more underrepresented. The most recent example is the electrochemically promoted coupling of alkenyl triflates with thiols employing air-sensitive Ni(cod)2 (15 mol%) reported by Pan and co-workers (Scheme 1b). 8j They demonstrated an extensive substrate scope for aryl thiols, but only a limited scope for alkyl thiols(3 examples) providing moderate yields.

We showed in our previous work on the sulfenylation of aryl chlorides that the reaction most likely proceeds through a Ni(0)/Ni(II) mechanism and acetate-assisted deprotonation of thiols, which is also plausible for the reaction of triflates (Scheme 5). The activation of the precatalyst, which is structurally related to the product of the oxidative addition, occurs via the same steps as the catalytic reaction (coordination of thiol, deprotonation and reductive elimination of the thioether). Interestingly, the reaction progress comparison of different electrophiles showed that aryl triflates not only have the highest reaction rate, but also the shortest induction period < 5 minutes (Scheme 6). It indicates a fast catalyst activation, which might be explained by a substrate assisted reductive elimination. This underlines the superiority of aryl triflates as electrophiles in this reaction.

Here, we compute aqueous-phase VIEs for a set of inorganic anions, some of which partition preferentially at the air/water interface, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. The results are in excellent agreement with experiment, regardless of whether the simulation data are restricted to ions at the air/water interface or to those in bulk liquid water. Although the computed VIEs are sensitive to ion-water hydrogen bonding, we find that the short-range solvation structure is sufficiently similar in the bulk and interfacial environments that it proves impossible to discriminate between the two on the basis of the VIE, a conclusion that has important implications for the interpretation of liquid-phase photoelectron spectroscopy. More generally, analysis of the simulation data suggests that partitioning of soft anions at the air/water interface is largely a second (or third) solvation shell effect, arising from disruption of water-water hydrogen bonds and not from significant changes in first-shell anion-water hydrogen bonding.', 'side. This idea has been put forward previously with regard to I -(aq), 141 IO - 3 (aq), and SCN -(aq), 144 and in particular the structural anisotropy around I -(aq) that is reported in Ref. 141 is reproduced by the simulations reported here; see Fig. . As such, the airexposed configurations of the interfacial ion are not solvated very differently as compared to the same ion in bulk water. Other studies have also pointed to asymmetric solvation environments around anions (more so than cations), even in bulk water. Our results suggest that the solvation environments of various soft anions are asymmetric both in bulk water and at the air/water interface, leading to VIEs that are essentially indistinguishable.the VIEs of these species in water, is mostly performed at photon energies where the attenuation length of the outgoing photoelectron is 1-10 nm, suggesting that the experiments are more sensitive to solutes at the interface. However, there has been little prior investigation of whether the VIEs themselves are sensitive to interfacial solvation, which is an especially relevant question for soft anions that are known to partition preferentially at the air/water interface. Our calculations suggest that differences between bulk and interfacial VIEs are inconsequential, which we attribute to similarities in first-shell hydration structure in both environments. These striking similarities serve as a reminder that although the structure of the air/water interface may be modified by the presence of dissolved ions, the hydration shell around a given solute may or may not be different than what it is bulk aqueous solution. Whereas liquid microjet', 'solute may or may not be different than what it is bulk aqueous solution. Whereas liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy may be surface-sensitive, our results strongly suggest that the observable that it measures is not surface-sensitive.This work also reports a new computational protocol for aqueous VIEs. The existing conventional wisdom is that a prohibitively large number of explicit water molecules is needed to obtain converged VIEs in aqueous solution, but with an appropriate choice of continuum boundary conditions we find that convergence is achieved with two solvation shells. VIEs reported here are within 0.2-0.3 eV of experimental values, even for polyvalent anions. This is comparable to the accuracy of the best existing periodic DFT calculations of the same quantities, but without the complexities posed by the periodic treatment when the number of electrons changes. The protocol reported here is also readily extensible to wave function-based quantum chemistry.Rapid convergence of the VIE in our cluster-continuum protocol suggests that this quantity is mostly sensitive to short-range solvation structure, with the continuum boundary conditions making a large but non-specific contribution at longer range. Similarities in bulk and interfacial VIEs result from similarities in the short-range hydration environment. Our', 'Results and DiscussionA. Comparison to Experiment. By tuning the photon energy and thereby the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons, 63 liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to measure the concentration profile (versus depth) of ions at the air/water interface. In other measurements, the concentration dependence of the photoelectron yield of aqueous aniline was found to correlate with the surface concentration inferred from surface tension measurements. If the ionwater hydrogen bonds are different at the interface as compared to those in bulk water, then the VIE might provide a probe of these structural changes. Indeed, comparison of the valence photoelectron spectra of the liquid and vapor phases of water suggests that spectral shifts engendered by hydrogen bonding are different depending on the orbital that is ionized, and the convergence tests VIEs for aqueous anions computed from bulk (isotropic) and interfacial (slab) simulations, in comparison to experimental VIEs from Ref. 86.

Observed similarities in the solvation structure of bulk versus interfacial anions sets up another interesting conundrum, namely, how to reconcile these observations with shifts in the O-H stretching band of water are detected (using surface-selective vibrational spectroscopy) when soft ions are present at the air/water interface. Our results suggest that this is likely a second-shell (or possibly third-shell) solvation effect, resulting from subtle changes in the network of waterwater hydrogen bonds that are induced by the presence of the ion, rather than resulting directly from changes in ion-water hydrogen bonds at the interface.

Very similar resultswere obtained for the two techniques, with little bubble formation observed up to 0.17-0.20 A cm -2 . At higher current densities, up to around 0.6 A cm -2 , bubbles were formed predominantly at the cathode. Given that commercial alkaline electrolysers typically operate at current densities up to 0.6 A cm -2 , this suggests that minimizing bubble formation at the cathode offers the key opportunity for further performance improvements in the capillary-fed cell. The cathode and anode produced bubbles at similar rates at still higher current densities, to 1 A cm-2. Even at 1 A cm -2 , the rate of bubble formation on the electrodes was substantially lower than in conventional, 'bubbled' electrolysis cells.

Middle panel shows the fraction of H 2 , D 2 and HD (f H 2 , f D 2 and f HD , respectively) in the gas mixture observed as a function of time. It is worth pointing out that fractional pressures are a more robust quantity than the partial pressures themselves since variations in sampling signal caused by changes in nozzle performance over time and overall pressure increase in the reaction chamber due to temperature increase gets cancelled out.

In case of thermally-driven reaction, HD fraction observed in absence of Au nanoparticles was smaller than 5% of the total HD produced (SI-3). For light-induced reaction, this quantity was several orders of magnitude smaller (SI-3).

As such, it is not obvious which (if any) of the theoretical values should be compared directly to experiment, for a given ion, although this ambiguity is largely mitigated by the close agreement between isotropic and slab VIEs. Agreement with experiment is comparable to the best available periodic DFT calculations, which reported a mean absolute error of 0.1 eV using range-separated hybrid functionals.

For reasons of computational expedience, these convergence tests were performed not with PEqS but instead using a polarizable continuum model (PCM), as convergence properties are similar in both cases. Convergence to the experimental VIE of 9.4 eV 86 is obtained using nonequilibrium boundary conditions with approximately two solvation shells of explicit water molecules, corresponding N ‚âà 40 water molecules or a cluster radius R ‚âà 6.0 √Ö around the ion. Similar convergence has been observed in the case of e -(aq), which might be considered something of a worst-case scenario due to the delocalized nature of the ion. This is obviously much faster convergence as compared to the hundreds of water molecules suggested above, and indeed it is clear from Fig. that convergence is dramatically slower in the absence of dielectric boundary conditions. Using vacuum boundary conditions, the VIE of NO - 3 (H 2 O) N is 1.0 eV smaller than the experimental value even with N ‚âà 70 explicit water molecules.

Here, we compute aqueous-phase VIEs for a set of inorganic anions, some of which partition preferentially at the air/water interface, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. The results are in excellent agreement with experiment, regardless of whether the simulation data are restricted to ions at the air/water interface or to those in bulk liquid water. Although the computed VIEs are sensitive to ion-water hydrogen bonding, we find that the short-range solvation structure is sufficiently similar in the bulk and interfacial environments that it proves impossible to discriminate between the two on the basis of the VIE, a conclusion that has important implications for the interpretation of liquid-phase photoelectron spectroscopy. More generally, analysis of the simulation data suggests that partitioning of soft anions at the air/water interface is largely a second (or third) solvation shell effect, arising from disruption of water-water hydrogen bonds and not from significant changes in first-shell anion-water hydrogen bonding.', 'in which GDS -3 √Ö and also GDS -5 √Ö is used to separate the bulk and interfacial regions.

For SCN -(aq), the peak of the VIE distribution is also exactly the same when the data are restricted to the interfacial region, no matter how narrowly defined, whereas for I -(aq) the interfacial VIE peak is shifted to 0.2 eV lower in energy in the interfacial region, for each of the three aforementioned definitions of the interfacial layer. That shift, however, is smaller than the width of either the bulk or the interfacial VIE distribution. We therefore conclude that interfacial VIE distributions are essentially indistinguishable from their bulk counterparts, for both I -(aq) and SCN -(aq).C. Analysis of Short-Range Structure. We have documented that two solvation shells of explicit water molecules is enough to provide converged VIEs when appropriate boundary conditions are employed, and that VIEs computed for anions at the air/water interface differ from their bulk counterparts (if at all) by a shift that is comparable to (or smaller than) the inhomogeneous broadening of the VIE distribution. This implies that any shift in the VIE for X -(aq) between the bulk and interfacial environments is hardly distinguishable from thermal fluctuations. Taken together with the rapid convergence of the VIE with respect to explicit water, this would seem to suggest that the short-range ion-water hydrogen bonding around X -(aq) might not be that different at the air/water interface as compared to the bulk aqueous environment. That hypothesis is explored in this section, by examining various structural parameters extracted from the MD simulations.Figure shows the time evolution of', ""exhibit significant surface propensity, the difference between isotropic and slab VIEs is 0.1 eV and 0.2 eV, respectively. Note that for I -(aq), experimental VIEs are reported corresponding to either of two different spin-orbit states of the ionized species. Calculations reported here do not include spin-orbit coupling so we use [VIE( 2 P 1/2 ) + 2 VIE( 2 P 3/2 )]/3 as an estimate of the spinorbit-free experimental VIE. Convergence tests in Fig. suggest that two solvation shells of explicit water molecules, with nonequilibrium Poisson boundary conditions, is sufficient to afford converged VIEs, even for multiply-charged anions. This observation strongly suggests that the electronic structure of these aqueous ions depends only on short-range interactions. The similarity between VIEs computed in isotropic versus slab simulations suggests, in turn, that the short-range ion-water interactions might be very similar in both environments. This hypothesis is investigated in Section 3 C. Before that, we dissect the matter of bulk versus interfacial VIEs in more detail by considering the full ensemble distribution of VIEs, for two different anions that exhibit surface propensities: I -(aq) and SCN -(aq).B.

It is not yet known whether VIEs of aqueous ions are sensitive to the air/water interface or not.That issue is examined here by computing bulk and interfacial VIEs for 16 common inorganic ions for which experimental data (from liquid microjets) are available, using a combination of MD simulations and electronic structure calculations.

"IntroductionRecent joint advances in computational and experimental methods for synthesizing nitride materials have led to a rapid increase in the number of known ternary nitride phases. Unlike ordered and stoichiometric compounds, alloys represent a continuous compositional space. Isostructural alloys -solid solutions of two or more materials with the same underlying crystal structure -are the most common types of functional alloys. Iso-structural alloys as electronic materials have applications in photovoltaics (e.g., II-VI materials such as CdSe x Te 1-x and III-V-based multijunction technologies ), energy storage (e.g., Li 6 PS 5-x Se x (Cl,I), Li 3 Y 1-x In x Cl 3 ), and thermoelectrics (e.g., PbSe x Te 1-x 9 ), etc. Heterostructural alloys, in contrast, form between materials with different structures, such as alloys between wurtzite AlN and rocksalt ScN, wurtzite ZnO and rocksalt MnO, and orthorhombic SnS and rocksalt CaS.

The calculated temperature-composition phase diagram reveals a large miscibility gap inducing spinodal decomposition at equilibrium conditions, with higher Gd substitution (meta)stabilized at higher temperatures.

We also considered a layered hexagonal-BN like structure of the alloys, but we find it to be energetically unfavorable as compared to the wurtzite and rocksalt structures over the full compositional range (Figure ). continuity in the spinodal line at x c is due to the incommensurate lattices of wurtzite and rocksalt, requiring a reconstructive phase transition. Beyond the unstable region is a region where single-phase alloys are metastable.

First-principles calculations using density functional theory in conjunction with SQS supercells reveal that the critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82. The calculated mixing free energy indicates that at equilibrium conditions and at temperatures below 1000 K, there is a large miscibility gap and only a few percent of Gd can be incorporated in AlN.

A number of residues in the scaffold's apolar tunnel (V83, A100, Q111) have previously been identified as being amenable to mutation and modification . Their location along the apolar tunnel provides an ideal starting point for the introduction of bipyridine into the protein scaffold to create an active site within a protein pocket. Three different sterol carrier proteins, each containing a unique cysteine at position Q111C, A100C or V83C, were prepared as described previously .

Enantioselective product formation was only observed in the presence of the Bpycontaining SCP-metalloenzymes.

Moderate activities and good enantiomeric ratios were observed with SCP_Q111BpyAla giving the highest e.r. of 14:86 in favour of the S enantiomer. In general, lower enantioselectivities were observed for the cysteine-modified catalysts and this is attributed to increased flexibility around the active site due to the additional S-CH2 linker. Changing from genetic incorporation of BpyAla at Q111 to bioconjugation of bipyridine through a cysteine, resulted in an unexpected change in the major isomer observed from S to R, albeit with a reduction in enantiomeric excess. This result is intriguing as a major challenge in enzyme catalysis is accessing the opposite product enantiomer. Crystallographic and computational studies confirm that changes in the structure of the active site led to the stabilisation of indole 3 on different sides of the bound enone 4, with the enantiomeric ratios observed correlating with the difference in the calculated transition state energies for the proR and proS SCP_Q111BpyAla and SCP_Q111CBpy Cu catalyst models.

We ran a QM/MM metadynamics to explore the conformational free energy landscape (FEL) of the -1 ring in BMA in the ER complex. As collective variables we defined the periodic Cremer-Pople puckering coordinate \uf06a between 0 and 2\uf020\uf070 (CV1), and the non-periodic angle \uf071 between 0 and \uf070 (CV2). We found that the minimum of energy is located around an E5 conformation separated by 1-2 kcal mol -1 with the conformations 4 H5 and O H5. Other explored conformational regions show a local minimum in the 1 S3 space being 3 kcal mol -1 less favorable than the E5. The expected O S2 conformation reported to be the initial structure in GMII, is not energetically favorable in our case. The E5 conformation is in good agreement with the conformation of the -1 ring in mannose found in the experimental complex with the Golgi alpha-mannosidase II D341N acid-base catalyst mutant (PDB id. 3BUP, œÜ = 309¬∫, Œ∏ = 54¬∫, Q = 0.56). Furthermore, the E5 conformation has also been found in the crystal structure of the Michaelis complex for another metal-dependent Œ±-mannosidase (GH92).  The accepted rate-limiting step of the hydrolytic mechanism of the family GH38 (i.e. GMII) implies the formation of a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate in a first step called glycosylation as shown in Figure . In hLAMAN, Asp196 acts as the nucleophile and Asp319 as the general acid/base catalyst. hLAMAN is a retaining glycosidase, so the released product (+1 ring) retains the absolute configuration on the anomeric', ""glycosidase, so the released product (+1 ring) retains the absolute configuration on the anomeric carbon. We defined two collective variables (CV1 and CV2) for the reaction mechanism (Figure ). CV1 is composed by the difference between d1 (distance between the center-of-mass -COM-of the carboxylic oxygen atoms in Asp319 and the proton Ha on the same residue) and d2 (distance between the former Ha atom and the glycosidic oxygen Og in BMA). CV2 is defined as the difference between d3 (distance between the Og oxygen of the +1 ring and the former C1' of the -1 ring) and d4 (distance between the anomeric carbon C1' and the COM of the carboxylate oxygen atoms in Asp196). In Figure , are shown our definition of CVs and the 2D-free energy landscape of the catalyzed reaction by the wild-type enzyme. The black line specifies the minimum free energy pathway (MFEP). The ER complex evolves to the EP complex via a transition state (ETS) with an QM/MM energy barrier ‚àÜG ‚Ä° of 7.2 kcal mol -1 . These energies were computed with DFTB3, a method that underestimates the energy barrier of the reaction. Thus, we recomputed the ETS for this reaction using the Nudged Elastic Band method (NEB) with GFN2-xTB (see Section S5). This DFT-semiempirical method includes dispersion corrections, something that was not present in the simulations with DFTB3. We obtained now an energy barrier of 19.8 kcal mol -1 , very close to the experimental value of the homologous enzyme GH38 from Aspergillus fischeri (activation energy barrier of 17.0 kcal mol -1 for the same substrate). In Figure , we show the structures of ER, ETS and EP"", 'CV1Additionally, the distances dHa-Og and dC1-On in the D74E ER complex slightly increase 0.12 and 0.08 √Ö, respectively (Table and Figure ). Overall, these changes in the Zn 2+ -coordination sphere and in the puckering of the reactant end up in significant increase in the energy barrier of the catalyzed reaction by the D74E variant. Furthermore, we wanted to look for other mutations on hLAMAN that may affect the conformation of the active site. To do this, we computed bond-to-bond propensities in the wild-type hLAMAN using the server ProteinLens to detect distal regions in the enzyme connected with the movement of the active site. In Figure and Table , we highlight the 50 residues identified to have a significant correlation with the active site within a 95 % quantile score. Interestingly, the algorithm detected two out of 26 known sequence positions related to catalytically-deficient hLAMAN variants: D159 and E402.Mutations in these positions drive to inactive variants (D159N and E402K) that, although they can fold and reach the lysosome, cannot process oligosaccharides. Visual inspection of our atomic model for wild-type hLAMAN indicates that the change D \uf0ae N on position 159 (at 10 √Ö from the active site) will prevent the dual interaction of the aspartic carboxylate with the amide hydrogens of A161 and A162 in the enzyme variant (Figure ). More critical is the change in position 402, where the introduction of a lysine residue in the position of a glutamic acid creates an electrostatic repulsion with the R403 amidinium group (located on the same helix) and a change in the orientation of the side chain of Q444, residue located close to one of', 'LAMAN (bLAMAN, PDB id. 1O7D) and Drosophila melanogaster Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (GM-II, PDB id. 3CZN) (see Figure and Section S1). The confidence obtained for the deeplearning model was extremely high for almost all residues in the structure of hLAMAN with exception of the N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-49), which was thus removed in our simulations. We placed the substrate \uf061-D-mannopyranose-(1-6)-\uf062-D-mannopyranose (BMA) at the active site and ran classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the \uf06ds-time scale to equilibrate, solvate and refine this complex (see Section S2). We applied distance restraints to preserve the key interactions for catalysis between the substrate BMA and both Asp196 and Asp319 residues. After equilibration, we gradually removed these constraints until we got a unrestrained system. As an outcome, we selected one snapshot of the final equilibrated system and ran quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics during 170 ps (Figure and Sections S3-S). The QM region definition included the coordination sphere of Zn 2+ (Asp196, Asp74, His72, and His445 side chains starting from the \uf062-carbon), the BMA substrate, and the side chain of the acid/base catalytic Asp319 (87 atoms in total, Figure ). We treated the QM region with the semiempirical tight-binding density functional theory DFTB3. Before simulating the enzyme-catalyzed reaction mechanism, we screened the puckering of the ring at the subsite -1 (-1 ring) in BMA for the enzyme-reactant (ER) complex (Figure and Section S3). We ran a QM/MM metadynamics to explore the conformational free energy', ""may be an additional ETS conformation in GHs. Table .

Prompted by our findings, we were committed to understand the effect of some of the missense mutations with significant impact on hLAMAN activity. This is the case of the D74E variant, where one extra methylene group is inserted into the side chain of this Zn 2+ -coordination sphere residue. First, we found out that the puckering of the reactive ring in BMA shows a different conformational energy profile than when bound to the wild-type counterpart (Figure vs Figure ). Now, the E5 conformation is energetically unfavorable towards a B2,5 conformation. We simulated the reaction mechanism for the same substrate BMA. We obtained a DFTB3 energy barrier of 12.3 kcal mol -1 , 5.1 kcal mol -1 (+75 %) larger than for the wild-type (Figure ). The height of the barrier increases up to a value of 37.3 kcal mol -1 via the NEB method (GFN2-xTB/ff19SB, Table vs. Table ). For this D74E variant, the observed mechanism follows the itinerary B2,5 ‚Üí B2,5 ‚Üí 1 S5. Looking in detail at the structures along the MFEP, the major changes respect to the wild-type counterpart are observed in the Zn 2+ -coordination sphere in the ER and ETS complexes.

Using alloy models in conjunction with density functional theory, we explored the full composition range for Al 1-x Gd x N and found that wurtzite is the ground state structure up to a critical composition of x = 0.82. The calculated temperature-composition phase diagram reveals a large miscibility gap inducing spinodal decomposition at equilibrium conditions, with higher Gd substitution (meta)stabilized at higher temperatures.

First-principles calculations using density functional theory in conjunction with SQS supercells reveal that the critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82. The calculated mixing free energy indicates that at equilibrium conditions and at temperatures below 1000 K, there is a large miscibility gap and only a few percent of Gd can be incorporated in AlN. Higher (effective) temperatures that can be accessed with non-equilibrium growth methods will enable higher Gd incorporation.

Note that our approach works with any (on-the-fly computed) PES and hence, at least in principle, the errors introduced by the underlying method for the PES and the other approximations to the entropy problem could be decomposed.The CREST algorithms were originally developed to generate rotamer containing ensembles and the related nuclei-exchange information for the simulation of NMR spectra . Hence, it seems straightforward not only to identify rotamers, but to extend the algorithm to automatically compute the proper degeneracy number g i . However, as mentioned above, conformer ensembles (CE) must be free from the indistinguishable rotamers to be compatible with entropy calculations. Therefore, g i are treated as unity in the usual case.The only exception here are symmetrical molecules that can form ""enantiomeric"" (i.e., in principle distinguishable) conformers through rotation of bonds. A typical case is the gauche conformer of n-butane. These geometrical enantiomers are degenerate and would be falsely classified as rotamers in our previous implementation. Effectively, this introduces a factor of g i = {1, 2} instead of g i in the degeneracy, depending on if the formation of a geometrical enantiomer is possible. Our new apprach considers this problem for the first time in a correct and automated way. Inserting this into the standard entropy expression for degenerate states leads toS conf = R ln g i e -E i Œ≤ + g i (E i Œ≤)e -E i Œ≤ g i e -E i Œ≤ .(10)The correct S msRRHO entropy is a population average over the', 'entropy S conf,est is determined. If no change (within a 2 % threshold) in S conf,est and the total number of unique conformers is observed, the final conformational entropy is calculated. Otherwise, a new iteration of 36 sMTDs is conducted using input structures and static bias structures determined from the updated ensemble. Furthermore, with each iteration the number of static bias structures is increased. This procedure is repeated until convergence is reached both with regards to S conf,est and the number of unique conformers in the ensemble. For the final calculation of S', 'Extrapolation to ensemble completenessFor very flexible systems (e.g. long alkanes), the number of accessible conformers ‚Ñ¶ is roughly proportional to ‚Ñ¶ ‚âà 3 R , where R is the number of freely rotatable bonds (commonly associated with the number of sp 3 -sp 3 carbon single bonds). In principle, all conformers, i.e., the complete ensemble and the respective energies are required for the calculation of S conf but even for only moderately sized systems this number is prohibitively huge.Practically, the obtained ensemble quality depends mostly on the run time t of the (biased) molecular dynamics (MD) in CREST. Basically, it is the number of optimized snap-shot structures gathered over all runs and will converge to a complete CE with the length of the conformational search. On the other hand, the conformational entropy also exhibits predictable behavior with regard to increasing ensemble completeness. If the lowest energy conformer is known, adding higher-lying conformers to the ensemble can only increase the entropy. If many of the low-energy structures are already found, the entropy increase for additional states is smooth and it seems possible to extrapolate to completeness without explicit knowledge of all conformers. The pre-requisite for this is the generation of enough intermediate points, i.e., consecutive conformational ensembles with systematically improved quality. A smooth and continuous convergence of the entropy to its maximum value can only be observed if conformers are added consistently from all regions of the PES (see Sec. 4.2 for examples).In the implementation of the algorithm, information from incomplete CEs of consecutive iterations is used for an extrapolation of the entropy according toS conf (x) -S conf (0) = p 1 (1 -exp (p 2 x p 3 )) , (15<formula', 'and further anharmonicity effects mainly in the high-frequency part.

The conformational entropy depends on the level of theory through the calculated populations entering the Gibbs-Shannon entropy formulation in Eq. 8, which in turn depend directly on the equilibrium (free) energies. But also for other configurational entropy approaches, that are usually cited as being purely informational, there exists a bias towards the underlying method used for the generation of molecular structures, for example by MD simulations.

This work: One-pot biocatalyst-initiated o-QM generation and diversification.', ""RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONToward developing a chemoenzymatic method for benzylic C-H functionalization, we tested the feasibility of biocatalytic C-H hydroxylation, coupled with o-QM formation and derivatization with a model substrate (see 16, Fig. ) that captures the conserved methyl resorcinol core of CitB and ClaD's native substrates. This model compound maintained the redox-sensitive aldehyde moiety and hydroxyl groups present in the citrinin biosynthetic intermediate (7). This model compound, 16, was completely consumed in 3 h upon exposure to 0.4 mol % CitB in the presence of Œ±-KG, an iron(II) source and sodium ascorbate in 50 mM TES buffer at pH 7.5 (Fig. ). From this reaction, a single benzylic alcohol product (17) was isolated in 82% yield without any evidence of oxidation of either the aldehyde or the resorcinol core. This result demonstrated that CitB could function on a non-native substrate with the robustness needed for preparative-scale synthesis with precise chemo-and site-selectivity. As a comparative measure, we subjected substrate 16 to several chemical oxidation conditions and did not observe conversion to desired benzylic alcohol 17 (see Supporting Information, Table ). For example, attempts to oxidize 16 with DDQ resulted in over-oxidation to the bisaldehdye and exposure of 16 to MnO2 40 or Ag2O 41 resulted in no observed reaction. Efforts to perform a benzylic hydroxylation with K2S2O8 or cerium ammonium nitrate led to decomposition of the substrate. Radical bromination with AIBN/NBS resulted in aromatic bromination and did not generate the desired benzylic halide for subsequent hydrolysis to the benzyl alcohol. These results"", ""Often, the harsh oxidizing reagents which are required for o-QM generation can interfere with downstream functionalization of o-QMs or prove incompatible with sensitive moieties on the substrate. As a result, significant reagent screening campaigns are often necessary to optimize direct oxidation reactions, creating additional constraints on the application of this approach. Therefore, a one-pot method for the chemo-and site-selective generation and diversification of o-QMs would address key challenges in exploiting these useful synthetic intermediates in synthesis.Inspired by the efficiency of Nature's approach for the generation of o-QMs, we sought to exploit enzymatic mechanisms for o-QM creation. In these systems, the o-QM is proposed to arise from ortho-cresol precursors (see 7, 9, Fig. ) through hydroxylation of the benzylic position, followed by loss of water to directly form an o-QM under mild intracellular conditions. These intermediates are subsequently functionalized with bioavailable dienophiles or nucleophiles, generating the associated natural products, such as peniphenone D (11). We anticipated that a biocatalytic approach to oxidative o-QM generation could afford numerous advantages in the development of a selective and sustainable method (Fig. ). This approach would combine the selectivity advantages of biocatalytic pre-functionalization with the ability to generate and diversify the o-QM in the same vessel under mild conditions.

Cox and coworkers demonstrated through in vivo experiments that CitB performs a benzylic hydroxylation in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin citrinin (8, Fig. ). ClaD was shown by Li and coworkers to perform a similar transformation in the biosynthesis of peniphenones and penilactones (Fig. , 9-11). We envisioned employing CitB and ClaD as general catalysts for benzylic hydroxylation of ortho-cresol substrates. We anticipated that, following benzylic C-H bond oxidation, an o-QM intermediate (see 12-14 Fig. ) could be accessed and intercepted with a variety of nucleophiles or dienophiles to form benzylic C-O, C-N, C-S, and C-C bonds in a biomimetic fashion.

A further time-killing kinetics study on K18S4 against Grampositive bacteria S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and V. anguillarum (a representative of the common pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture) revealed a quick killing of bacteria at 2√óMIC concentration of K18S4, such as the complete killing of V. anguillarum within 30 minutes (Fig ). The bacteria-killing of K18S4 was much faster than that of conventional antibiotic thiamphenicol, indicating advantages of K18S4 in treating aquacultureencountered bacterial infections.To examine if bacteria can develop resistance to the peptide polymers, we treated Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli with K18S4 at 0.5√óMBC concentration continuously, and found that none of the bacteria developed resistance against K18S4 even after continuous treatment for 888 and 1152 generations of S. aureus and Even if an antibacterial agent, such as K18S4, shows low tendency to induce antimicrobial resistance, full degradability is still highly desired for antibiotic substitutes in aquaculture. The massive use and subsequent discharge of the antimicrobial agents to the environment may cause antimicrobial selective pressure and disruption of balance of the complicated microbial system in the environment, which is a big concern in massive use of antibiotics in aquaculture. Therefore, an ideal substitution of antibiotics in aquaculture should be fully degradable to individual residues and thus lose antibacterial activity completely after degradation. K18S4 was completely degraded within 6 hours in the presence of protease type XXIII from Aspergillus oryzae, as confirmed by NMR analysis on the disappearance of the characteristic peaks for Œ±-CH group on the peptide backbone at In addition to enzymes produced by microorganisms, K18S4 can also be degraded by trypsin and chymotrypsin that are widely distributed in the digestive tract.

Interestingly, incubation of E. coli and V. anguillurm with Dye-K18S4 and PI both led to immediate enrichment of Dye-K18S4 on the cell membrane, and then obvious enrichment of Dye-K18S4 and PI into the bacteria after incubation for a longer time (Fig 4d ). Fluorescence intensity analysis across E. coli and V. anguillurm, both echoed the two stages that Dye-K18S4 firstly accumulated on the cell membrane of E. coli and V. anguillurm, and then entered the cells (Fig ). In further outer membrane permeability assays at the early stage of bacteria-polymer interaction, K18S4 was found to cause significant permeability changes to the outer membranes of E. coli and V. anguillurm, similar to polymyxin B (Fig 5a ). Adding exogenous LPS, a main component of the outer membrane, to K18S4 showed a LPS dose-dependent antibacterial activity against E. coli and V. anguillurm (Fig ). These results are consistent to aforementioned observation of K18S4 enrichment on the outer membrane of E. coli and V. anguillurm (Fig 4d ). Therefore, the antibacterial mechanism of K18S4 against Gram-negative E. coli and V. anguillurm may be explained by the strong interaction on cell membrane. Interestingly, K18S4 only caused mild depolarization on cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-positive S. aureus (Fig ) at the early stage of bacteria-polymer interaction, which may not be enough to pose an adequate threat. So we speculated that there may still be other antibacterial mechanisms.Oxidative stress is involved in the', 'that there may still be other antibacterial mechanisms.Oxidative stress is involved in the antibacterial process of a variety of cationic antibacterial peptides .Membrane perturbation and DNA binding are both common ways to cause the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level . In addition to the observed mild membrane polarization at the early stage of bacteria-polymer interaction, K18S4 could strongly bind to DNA at even low N:P ratio of 1:1, which suggests a possible generation of ROS within bacteria after K18S4 treatment (Fig ). So, we used 2,7dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) as the probe to determine the ROS level in bacteria. After K18S4 treatment on bacteria for 1 hour, the ROS level of S. aureus, E. coli and V. anguillurm all increased significantly compared to normal bacterial cells. (Fig ). By adding ROS scavenger N-acetyl-lcysteine (NAC) to inhibit the increase of ROS level in bacteria, the MBC of K18S4 increased by only 2 times against E. coli and V. anguillurm, but 8 times (changing from 25 Œºg/mL to 200 Œºg/mL) against S. aureus (Fig ). This result indicated that ROS played an important role in the antimicrobial process of K18S4 against S. aureus. Among the possible ROS related antibacterial mechanisms, the increase of intracellular ROS level after the peptide polymer entered the bacteria could cause the damage of bacterial membrane due to membrane lipid peroxidation .

We also observed substantially reduced bacterial load in liver, spleen and kidney after administration of K18S4 (Fig ). The infected zebrafish treated with PBS showed obvious symptoms of hemorrhagic sepsis; whereas, zebrafish treated with K18S4 were similar to healthy zebrafish and showed no symptoms of hemorrhagic sepsis (Fig ). Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration of K18S4 did not affect the liver and kidney function of healthy zebrafish (Fig ).

"V. CONCLUDING REMARKSSurprisal analysis of experimental distributions in physics, chemistry and biology can often be characterized even by a single dominant constraint. A very recent example is the analysis of COVID19 patient gene expression samples to identify a single constraint, a gene module, that strongly aligns with disease severity. In the present work we develop an approach that allows to extract the dominant constraints for different scenarios of the coherent quantum dynamics on multiple electronic states. We show that such an approximate but compact treatment of the density provides good accuracy for both electronic and vibrational population and coherence dynamics.A density operator that is an exponential function of the constraints is a central result of the maximal entropy formalism. It follows that the surprisal, the logarithm of the density, is then a linear function of the operators of the constraints. The linearity allows a ready analysis of the importance of each constraint in the description of the density, in contrast to the density operator which is an exponential function of the not necessarily commuting constraints. In practice the expansion of the surprisal is analogous to the computation of the coefficients of the linear expansion of a function in an orthonormal basis set, with the key difference that here instead of the functions in Hilbert space we use operators as basis vectors in Liouville space.By direct propagation of the surprisal we obtain the matrix of the surprisal at different times of the dynamics. It is a general procedure and allows describing dynamics for any type of the potential and interstate coupling. We then evaluate the Lagrange multipliers -the coefficients of the chosen set of constraints, using the orthogonality relations established for this set of operators. We discuss both the cases when the algebra is",Causal,Why is surprisal analysis effective in identifying a single dominant constraint in the analysis of COVID-19 patient gene expression samples?,Answer not available from the given context. ,Negative,"['Surprisal analysis of experimental distributions in physics, chemistry and biology can often be characterized even by a single dominant constraint.

A coupling of the system to its environment can also be described by the Lie algebraic technique that we use but such an application of the surprisal as an exact numerical tool remain to be implemented in detail.We develop an approach where the time-evolution of a quantum system is provided through the surprisal of the density matrix, . The propagation of the surprisal in time is described by the same evolution operator as the propagation of the density matrix. We also seek to make a bridge to empirical surprisal analysis. In these practical applications approximate compact representations of the surprisal were usefully applied to characterize dominant behavior patterns in complex systems. The characterization of a system using the logarithm of its probability distribution was pioneered already by Gibbs and Boltzmann. The statistical notion of entropy was introduced by Boltzmann as a logarithmic measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied. Gibbs described the properties of the canonical ensemble showing that it is characterized by the minimum of \'-entropy\'. The quantum mechanical foundations of these thermodynamic ideas are given in detail in chapter V of Ref. 15 and are discussed critically by Already in the Boltzmann\'s ""method of the most probable distribution"" one can identify the main idea that accompanied surprisal along its historical path -the idea of asking only questions about properties of the system that are reproducible in many experimental replications. The connection to information theory can be made by special reference to the first coding theorem of Shannon. The quantum mechanical analog of the coding theorem is by ÀÜ√é lnr = -Schumacher. It', 'Surprisal of a quantum state: dynamics, compact representation and coherence effects Progress towards quantum technologies continues to provide essential new insights on the microscopic dynamics of systems in phase space. This highlights coherence effects whether these are due to ultrafast lasers whose energy width spans several states all the way to the output of quantum computing. Surprisal analysis has provided seminal insights on the probability distributions of quantum systems from elementary particle and also nuclear physics, through molecular reaction dynamics to system biology. It is therefore necessary to extend surprisal analysis to the full quantum regime where it characterizes not only the probabilities of states but also their coherence. In principle this can be done by the maximal entropy formalism but in the full quantum regime its application is far from trivial [E.g., S. Dagan and  Y. Dothan, Phys Rev D 26, 248 1982] because an exponential function of not commuting operators is not easily accommodated. Starting from an exact dynamical approach we develop a description of the dynamics where the quantum mechanical surprisal, a linear combination of operators, plays a central role. We provide an explicit route to the Lagrange multipliers of the system and identify those operators that act as the dominant constraints.', 'analog of the coding theorem is by ÀÜ√é lnr = -Schumacher. It provides a basis for the quantum mechanical applications of information theory.How can one determine the state of the system leading to events that are most probable and therefore reproducible by repeated experiments? The maximal entropy approach seeks to reconstruct the density matrix of the system in its most probable state in a situation of incomplete knowledge, when only partial information about the system is available. The commonly discussed scenario is when we know N mean values for a set of operators typically called the constraints. In general this set of expectation values is not sufficient to uniquely determine the state. Among all density operators that are consistent with the given mean values of the constraints we select the one (unique) density of whose entropy is maximal.This density operator is represented as an exponential function of those operators whose mean values are given. For this density matrix, the surprisal is a linear function of the operators that are the constraints with coefficients that are the Lagrange multipliers that arise in seeking a maximum of the entropy subject to constraints. The linearity of the surprisal as a function of the constraints is especially convenient when the operators do not commute and an exponential form in the operators calls for special handling, e.g., Ref. 22.An established route for the computation of the dynamical evolution of the surprisal is via an algebraic procedure for the dynamics of the constraints in the Heisenberg picture. The equations of motion for the constraints are derived using their commutation relation with the Hamiltonian and can be solved analytically if the set of', 'two other derivations of a density matrix that also are of an exponential form like Eq. ( ) but where the motivation is tightly connected to the dynamics. In a theoretical or computational discussion, one often initiates the dynamics from a pure state. But in reality, the initial state is often a mixture and then it makes sense to start from an initial density of maximal entropy subject to those constraints that govern the yet unperturbed state,. For such an initial state we now show that the exact time evolution of the density or of the surprisal is described with a finite number of time-dependent constraints with time independent Lagrange multipliers. The proof requires the unitarity of the time evolution operator and a series expansion of the exponential:(The time-dependent constraints are the terms in the curly brackets, and there are as many time-dependent constraints as the number of constraints in the initial state. In section III we discuss how to compute directly the surprisal:The method of computing the surprisal can also be applied should we wish to obtain explicit expressions for the individual time-dependent constraints.We next come to a simpler but more specialized result. It is valid for the special case when the dynamics of the constraints are closed under commutation relation with the Hamiltonian.In such a limiting situation the exact time evolution can be described with a finite number of time-independent constraints but with time dependent Lagrange multipliers with known equations of motion.

This approximate treatment follows the spirit of the information theory approach -description of the density matrix using only a partial but essential knowledge about the system.To discuss systems with more than a few degrees of freedom a large basis is needed for numerical convergence. So exact propagation of the surprisal on a finite basis will be computationally demanding. However, the dynamics of the Lagrange multipliers of the dominant constraints may be sufficient for most purposes. This opens a different way of approximating the quantum dynamics in many-body systems, a subject for future research.In section II we show that if the initial state of a system is described as a state of maximal entropy, a finite set of time-dependent constraints is sufficient to reproduce the surprisal at all subsequent times. During a unitary time-evolution the rank of the density matrix is conserved so the number of the time-dependent constraints is the same as the number of constraints on the initial state. In section II we further describe the special circumstances where an algebraically delineated finite set of time-independent constraints is sufficient to describe the dynamics. The algebraic procedure to convert the dynamics of the surprisal to a compact evolution of the Lagrange multipliers is introduced. Section III discusses the proposed computational scheme for an exact dynamical evolution of the surprisal in a finite dimensional space. The computation of the time evolution in such a space is exact because we show that there is always a large but finite set of time-independent constraints that is closed under commutation with the Hamiltonian.

This model compound maintained the redox-sensitive aldehyde moiety and hydroxyl groups present in the citrinin biosynthetic intermediate (7). This model compound, 16, was completely consumed in 3 h upon exposure to 0.4 mol % CitB in the presence of Œ±-KG, an iron(II) source and sodium ascorbate in 50 mM TES buffer at pH 7.5 (Fig. ). From this reaction, a single benzylic alcohol product (17) was isolated in 82% yield without any evidence of oxidation of either the aldehyde or the resorcinol core. This result demonstrated that CitB could function on a non-native substrate with the robustness needed for preparative-scale synthesis with precise chemo-and site-selectivity. As a comparative measure, we subjected substrate 16 to several chemical oxidation conditions and did not observe conversion to desired benzylic alcohol 17 (see Supporting Information, Table ). For example, attempts to oxidize 16 with DDQ resulted in over-oxidation to the bisaldehdye and exposure of 16 to MnO2 40 or Ag2O 41 resulted in no observed reaction. Efforts to perform a benzylic hydroxylation with K2S2O8 or cerium ammonium nitrate led to decomposition of the substrate.

Yet, in spite of several decades of investigations, its intimate working mechanisms still remain elusive. In particular, the behavior of the acid proton and its localization -either on the molecule or on the surfaceare still open issues. By modeling the adsorption of formic acid on top of regular (101) anatase TiO 2 surfaces, we found that, in the 0 K limit, the acid proton is shared between a carboxylic oxygen and a surface oxygen. In this regime, the proton behavior is mainly governed by quantum delocalization effects in a single potential well. Nonetheless, as temperature is raised to room conditions, simulations evidenced a rapid ""classical"" shuttling of the proton due to the onset of a two-wells free energy profile separated by a free energy barrier of the order of kT. This picture, supported by the agreement between simulated and experimental IR spectra, shows that the titania surface acts like a protecting group for the carboxylic acid functionality. Such a conceptual insight might help rationalize the chemical processes of carboxylic species on TiO 2 surfaces.', 'IntroductionAdsorption of organic molecules on TiO 2 lies at the basis of many applications in sustainable technologies. Formic acid (HCOOH), as the simplest organic acid and one of the most investigated hydrogen storage/source materials, is the choice candidate to explore how carboxylic groups interact with TiO 2 surfaces. This interaction governs both the anchoring of solar cell sensitizers and the interfacial transfer of photogenerated reactive species, a key step in photocatalytic applications. Besides the environmentally relevant HCOOH‚áÜCO 2 +H 2 processes, via a direct, ""atom-economical"" greenchemistry route, the most stable and abundant {101} anatase surfaces can trigger formic acid amidation and the oligomerization of aminoacids under prebiotic conditions In view of its relevance, the adsorption of small carboxylic acids on titania (anatase) has been largely investigated both experimentally and by modeling. Surface science experiments on anatase {101} showed, via IRRAS on single crystal, that HCOOH adsorbs dissociatively, both in a', 'on anatase {101} showed, via IRRAS on single crystal, that HCOOH adsorbs dissociatively, both in a monodentate and in a bidentate geometry. The actual anchoring structure was shown to be dependent on the presence of defects, in particular ""the bidentate form requires the presence of oxygen vacancies"". Also STM investigations of acetic acid on {101} anatase indicated a dissociative adsorption. However, neither IRRAS nor STM studies provided a clear indication of the acid proton fate. Specifically, no signal typical of the-OH stretching mode was detected by IRRAS upon dosing HCOOH on {101} anatase single crystal, and no surface hydroxyl groups were detected in STM analyses of acetic acid on top of TiO 2 -(101) anatase. Also, whereas experiments and modeling studies agree on that HCOOH might adsorb dissociatively on TiO 2 -rutile , stepped {101} anatase, and minority facets of TiO 2 -anatase (like the highly-reactive {001} ), both dissociative and molecular adsorption structures have been predicted for regular flat {101} facets depending on the adopted calculation approaches. Note however that, to the best of our knowledge, in all modeling studies performed to date the acid proton is always', 'Figure ). Hence, taken together, our results suggest that a ""classic"" proton-shuttling model may be eligible to describe the HCOOH adsorption on defect-free portions of anatase TiO 2 {101} surfaces at room temperature. A third remark, which is more chemical in nature, is that both the quantum and the classical picture predict that HCOOH on top of TiO 2 anatase is essentially a neutral moiety (see Bader charges in Table in the SI) with its acid functionality ""protected"" by the surface, owing to the presence of a strong hydrogen bond. Thus, its reactivity may be substantially different from that of a fully-dissociated formic acid -i.e. an adsorbed negatively charged formate and a Br√∏nsted acid surface site formed upon protonation of TiO 2 (101) anatase. Indeed, the ""protecting-group"" role of the surface highlighted by our study might explain, for example, why, carboxylic acids pre-adsorbed on TiO 2 nanoparticles undergo amidation instead of salt formation upon addition of amines. Conclusions By using first principles approaches we propose a model for the adsorption of light carboxylic acids on regular {101} surfaces of TiO 2 -anatase: the adsorbate is bound to a Ti-Lewis acid centre via a carboxyl oxygen, and to a surface oxygen via a ""floating"" proton, with the surface acting like a protecting group for the carboxylic acid functionality, owing to the presence of a short hydrogen bond (HB). This model accounts for the peculiar reactivity of adsorbed carboxylic acids upon addition of amines. The novelty of this picture, which is consistent with spectroscopic experiments, is a dynamical model of the adsorbed moiety, involving either a rapid proton shuttling between a carboxylic and a surface oxygen, or a proton sharing between these two atoms due to quantum delocalization.

We focus on a regular non-defective (101) model, and adopt different anchoring geometries for the adsorption of HCOOH.

Moreover, the temperature where exponential self-replication was observed was tunable by varying the stability of the template:fragment complexes through the introduction of mismatches in addition to the destabilizing abasic group, revealing that self-replication was intrinsically linked to the stability of the DNA complexes formed throughout the catalytic cycle. This method of lesioninduced DNA amplification (LIDA) has proven general for amplifying a variety of 18mer sequences, usually requiring the introduction of only one abasic nucleotide into one of the four fragments. Because of its sequence generality, LIDA represents a useful model system for understanding autonomous oligonucleotide self-replication. Nevertheless, our efforts to perform nonenzymatic self-replication using abasic destabilizing groups and rapid chemical ligation methods yielded poor results, suggesting that the enzyme was playing a more substantial role in our rapid self-replicating system beyond simply catalyzing the formation of the phosphodiester linkage.To elucidate the role of the enzyme and identify principles for self-replication that can inform the design of autonomous, nonenzymatic oligonucleotide replication, here we utilize a kinetic model of cross-catalysis to identify the important kinetic and thermodynamic parameters in our ligase chain reaction of abasic site-containing strands.

These results confirmed that an abasic group in the DNA system lowered the stability of the product duplex considerably with a much lesser effect on the stabilities of the intermediate complexes. With respect to understanding the implications for turnover, the relevant comparison is the magnitude difference in K for the product versus the intermediate complexes for the system with and without the abasic group. The thermodynamic parameters revealed that the presence of the abasic group reduced the stability gaps between the association constants of the product duplex and intermediate complexes by 4-5 orders of magnitude (K of product and intermediate with abasic: 10 8 M -1 and 10 3 -10 4 M -1 , respectively, versus K of product and intermediate with complementary thymidine: 10 12 M -1 and 10 4 -10 5 M -1 , respectively). Yet the magnitude difference in association constants of the product and intermediate complexes for the system with the abasic was still substantial (3-5 orders of magnitude).To evaluate the same thermodynamic parameters under DNA self-replication conditions, we utilized a simplified kinetic model of our cross-catalytic system (reaction steps are shown in Table ). Using this model to fit our kinetic traces, we can determine the apparent hybridization K values exhibited during LIDA based on the ratio of the forward and reverse rate constants obtained from the fit. These apparent binding constants can then be compared with our previous thermodynamic analysis. To  Using the chemical reactions shown in Table , all four traces in Figure were fit simultaneously using KinTek Explorer to obtain the kinetic parameters of our self-replication system. To minimize the number of fit parameters, we assumed that the formation of the ternary complexes for both cycles occurred in two steps, each step with the same forward and reverse rate', ""ConclusionIn conclusion, it has been shown that the addition of an abasic group at the ligation site instead of thymidine decreases the product duplex affinity constants for a particular 18mer duplex from 10 12 M -1 to 10 8 M -1 and the intermediate complex from 10 4 -10 5 M -1 to 10 3 -10 4 M -1 at 30 ¬∞C, the optimal replication temperature for this sequence. However, in the presence of an enzyme, the stability gap between the abasic-containing product and intermediate complexes is reduced from 10 4 -10 5 to 10 2 . We attribute this surprising difference to the stronger affinity of the enzyme for the intermediate rather than product complexes. This finding explains how we observe very fast selfreplication with LIDA despite the expected product inhibition. Indeed, our kinetic model reveals how rapid self-replication can be achieved even when the affinity constants are higher for the product duplex and the intermediate complex; a fast enough kcat is required together with a high enough affinity constant for the intermediate complex. Altogether, both the abasic group at the ligation site (which preferentially destabilizes the product duplex) and T4 DNA ligase (which preferentially stabilizes the intermediate) play significant roles in achieving rapid isothermal DNA self-replication. Therefore, a successful oligonucleotide self-replication system should incorporate product destabilization and a catalyst that favors the intermediate complex to further overcome product inhibition. These results can guide efforts to generate autonomous self-replicating oligonucleotides that use chemical rather than enzymatic ligation.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.

The IIaP strand contains the destabilizing abasic group at the 5'"", 'k-2 was reduced to 0.1 x k-2, there was no self-replication observed (Figure ). These results suggested that product inhibition is important as the rate of dissociation of the template:product strongly influences the success of the self-replication. Yet the overall stability of the intermediate complex also plays a significant role, which had until now been overlooked. In addition, simulations were conducted with 5 x kcat and 0.2 kcat to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the rate of ligation. When the kcat is 5 times faster than the value determined from our best fit of the data, the self-replication was much faster than what we observed. Conversely, the ligation rate was much slower when kcat was reduced by a factor of (0.2 x kcat), resulting in slow amplification of the templates (Figure ). These simulations are consistent with previous work that showed a strong dependence of replication on the magnitude of kcat of ligation. These simulations reveal two important take-home messages for developers of nonenzymatic self-replicating systems: they should focus on ways to stabilize the intermediate complex as well as ways to destabilize the product duplex and select rapid ligation strategies. Regarding the latter, very little product was observed within the first 7200 seconds (2 hours) of reaction when kcat was reduced to 0.1kcat (simulation not shown).Next, to provide some insight as to how the presence of the abasic affected the interactions with the enzyme, we determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat and Km for the ligation reaction in Cycle I for the system with and without the abasic group. The previous report on the affinity of T4 DNA ligase for nicked versus complete duplexes did not contain abasic groups. This previous work indicated that nicked ligation by T4 DNA ligase', 'Self-replication of nucleic acids in the absence of enzymes such as polymerases or ligases represents an important and poorly understood step in the origin of life. In fact, the self-replication of nucleic acids remains strongly hindered by product inhibition, even when enzymes are present.Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self-replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved.Previously, our group reported lesion-induced DNA amplification (LIDA), which is an isothermal ligase chain reaction. It was proposed that the lesion, a destabilizing abasic group, played an important role in reducing product inhibition. However, using abasic groups in non-enzymatic ligation cycles did not yield appreciable amplification. In order to identify the unknown factors that overcome product inhibition in LIDA, we have performed a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the process, employing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and global fitting of PAGE fluorescence data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We found that in the absence of an enzyme, the ligated product binds four to five orders of magnitude more tightly to the template than to the shorter unligated strands of the intermediate complex. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase, this stability gap was reduced by two orders of magnitude, such that the intermediate and product complexes were roughly equal in stability. Thus, the ligase helps overcome product inhibition by reducing the affinity difference between the DNA product duplex and the intermediate complex. Furthermore, kinetic simulations showed that the stability of the intermediate complex, as well as the rate constant of ligation, significantly impacts the rate of self-replication, suggesting that catalysts that stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to', 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b29"">[30] For example, spontaneous ligation by non-heritable 2\'-5\'-linked oligonucleotides was demonstrated to weaken the overall duplex stability. . However, such methods of incorporating destabilizing groups have not been used in a successful self-replication system based on chemical ligation strategies.One area of great success in the quest to identify self-replicating nucleic acids, however, is in ribozymes: RNA sequences on the order of 66-76 nucleotides (nt) with sequence-dependent catalytic function. In 2009, the Joyce lab identified a ribozyme that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds and used it to generate a self-replicating oligonucleotide system that exhibited sigmoidal growth indicative of exponential self-replication. Yet these replicating systems are not a model of general oligonucleotide replication as they require specific RNA sequences to confer this catalytic property. Interestingly, the most facile replicators in the selfreplicating ribozyme system did have destabilizing modifications between the template and the complementary fragments in the form of a U:G wobble pair. These results suggested that destabilizing mismatches could facilitate replication.Previously our lab discovered an isothermal ligase chain reaction that exhibited rapid, exponential amplification of 18mer sequences using a common DNA ligase and four fragment sequences, one of which contained a model abasic lesion in place of a complementary nucleotide at the 5\'-phosphate terminus (Figure ).

We anticipate that our method for biocatalyst-initiated o-QM generation can be broadly applied to other chemoenzymatic systems capable of performing benzylic C-H hydroxylation and will enable transformations complementary to small molecule catalysts and reagents.

These results capture the challenge in accomplishing this seemingly simple benzylic hydroxylation in the presence of redox-sensitive aldehyde and phenolic groups, as well as the advantages provided by biocatalytic benzylic C-H hydroxylation. Next, the reactivity of benzylic alcohol 17 was investigated under aqueous conditions. Gratifyingly, upon gentle heating in the presence of thiophenol, alcohol 17 was quantitatively transformed into thioether 20 through an anticipated o-QM intermediate (18-19). These experiments provided evidence for o-QM formation under remarkably mild conditions compared to previous reports for the generation of o-QMs from ortho-hydroxy benzylic alcohols. Evidence that CitB is sufficiently robust to perform preparative-scale reactions and provide access to o-QMs under mild conditions spurred further investigation of this chemoenzymatic strategy for benzylic functionalization, including studies with the homologous NHI enzyme, ClaD. To investigate the substrate scope of CitB and ClaD, a panel of substrates was synthesized possessing an ortho-cresol core (Fig. ). This panel was designed to define the electronic and steric parameters of substrates that undergo a productive reaction with the NHI biocatalysts. Compounds 9, 16, and 23-42 were subjected to analytical-scale reactions with CitB and ClaD, using standard conditions for Œ±-KGdependent non-heme iron oxygenases.

Current efforts are focused on obtaining engineered enzyme variants that do not require substrates bearing a hydrogen bond acceptor, such as an aldehyde, for a productive reaction to occur. To probe the substrate scope of our biocatalysts beyond resorcinol substrates, phenolic compounds 39 and S5 (see Supporting Information) were subjected to CitB hydroxylation conditions. Phenol 39 was converted to the corresponding benzylic alcohol; however, the position of the hydroxyl group proved to be important for catalysis as phenol S5 was not oxidized by either CitB or ClaD. These results motivated us to synthesize an additional panel of phenolic substrates to further assess the scope of NHI biocatalytic hydroxylation (40-42). In the case of CitB, increasing the steric bulk at the C5 position increased the conversion of substrates to hydroxylated products except for 2-naphthyl substrate 42, which demonstrated decreased conversion, possibly reflecting the steric limitations of the CitB active site. ClaD was unable to hydroxylate phenolic substrates 40-42.As a next step in the evaluation of the synthetic utility of the NHI dioxygenase-catalyzed benzylic C-H hydroxylation, we performed reactions on preparative-scale using whole cell (CitB) and crude cell lysate (ClaD) conditions (Fig. ). This method enabled routine performance of reactions on >500 mg scale without the requirement for protein purification. Isolation and characterization of C5-substituted benzylic alcohol products 17 and 46-48 was achieved with yields that corresponded to starting material consumption. For example, benzylic alcohol 17 was isolated in 82% yield. However, poor isolated yields were obtained for substrates with C6-substituents, despite nearly complete consumption of starting material (see 49-53).

Cox and coworkers demonstrated through in vivo experiments that CitB performs a benzylic hydroxylation in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin citrinin (8, Fig. ). ClaD was shown by Li and coworkers to perform a similar transformation in the biosynthesis of peniphenones and penilactones (Fig. , 9-11). We envisioned employing CitB and ClaD as general catalysts for benzylic hydroxylation of ortho-cresol substrates. We anticipated that, following benzylic C-H bond oxidation, an o-QM intermediate (see 12-14 Fig. ) could be accessed and intercepted with a variety of nucleophiles or dienophiles to form benzylic C-O, C-N, C-S, and C-C bonds in a biomimetic fashion. Here, we demonstrate this approach with two biocatalysts, but we anticipate this chemoenzymatic platform could be executed with a plethora of wild-type enzymes to access more diverse substrates and complementary selectivity.']","['Unclassified', 'Unclassified']",3667,1,1,0,0.981757447,0.945439543,['why']

The ICP-MS measurements display a steady increase in the concentration of Cu species in solution both, before and during the chronoamperometry. However, no Bi ions could be detected in the electrolyte. While ICP-MS does not provide information over the oxidation state of the detected Cu species, the Pourbaix diagram of Cu indicates that the most stable copper species at the electrolyte pH of 5.7 and the OCP potential of the CuBi2O4 electrode (~ 0.5V vs. RHE) is Cu 2+ .[7a] Moreover, SEM/EDX images, Figure , clearly show the presence of BiPO4 structures which grows on top of the CuBi2O4 film as multiple branches, with single branches growing even up to few micrometers in length.

CuBi2O4 undergoes photocorrosion to Bi and Cu, and further dissolves releasing Cu ions in the electrolyte and forming BiPO4. The rapid formation of Bi correlates with an abrupt drop of photocurrents.ABSTRACT. CuBi2O4 has recently emerged as a promising photocathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, its fast degradation under operation currently poses a limit to its application. Here, we report a novel method to study operando the semiconductor-electrolyte interface during PEC operation by surface-sensitive high-energy Xray scattering. We find that a fast decrease in the generated photocurrents correlates directly with the formation of a metallic Bi phase. We further show that the slower formation of metallic Cu, as well as the dissolution of the electrode in contact with the electrolyte, further affect the CuBi2O4 activity and morphology. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the degradation mechanisms affecting CuBi2O4 electrodes under operation and poses the methodological basis to investigate the photocorrosion processes affecting a wide range of PEC materials.', 'at intermediate and later stages of the measurement. This behavior likely results from the onset of BiPO4 deposition at the surface of the electrode, which leads to a local increase of the surface compactness. The value of ùëõ does not saturate at 40 min, suggesting that the restructuring of the surface may further extend to later times. We additionally analyze GISAXS data obtained during measurements of the open circuit potential (OCP) under chopped light illumination (Figures S21-S28), and account for the transmitted and reflected X-ray intensities by the electrode film.

Here we show that multiple degradation pathways are occurring in parallel at the surface of CuBi2O4 electrodes. In particular, we find that CuBi2O4 reduces to metallic Bi and metallic Cu during operation, as shown in Figure , while at the same time Cu ions are released in the electrolyte and BiPO4 crystallizes on the electrode surface also in the absence of applied bias and illumination. We verify our findings by complementary ex-situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), ICP-MS and electron microscopy studies.', 'SummaryIn this work, we show an operando high-energy X-ray scattering method to investigate the photocorrosion mechanisms and relative time scales on photo-electrochemically active CuBi2O4 electrodes. We measure TS and SAXS simultaneously in grazing incidence to reveal structural modification close to the CuBi2O4-electrolyte interface. We show that under illumination and applied bias the CuBi2O4 electrodes quickly undergo a cathodic photocorrosion process which determines the formation of a segregating metallic Bi phase. This process takes place on a time scale of only few minutes after beginning of the chronoamperometry and correlates with a decrease of around one order of magnitude in the observed photocurrents. Moreover, additional degradation processes occur on slower time scales: formation of metallic Cu and dissolution in the electrolyte as an effect of both anionic photocorrosion and acidic dissolution. The two phenomena cause a steady release of Cu 2+ ions in solution as well as the crystallization of BiPO4 branched structures at the surface of the electrode due to the interaction of the releasing Bi 3+ ions with the phosphate species in the electrolyte. The formation of an insulating BiPO4 layer is likely responsible for the slow decrease in the measured photocurrents at intermediate and later stages of the chronoamperometry.In summary, our study shows that the high-energy X-ray scattering can probe structural information ranging from atomic to nanometer length scales in a realistic experimental environment, thus allowing to simultaneously correlate chemical and morphological modification of the film electrode with changes of photocurrent. Understanding how photoactive electrodes degrade under operation conditions is the first step towards new strategies for increasing the long-term stability and improving efficiency, but also planning the sustainable disposal strategies.

The corresponding rates are calculated using chronoamperometric techniques.', 'ResultsCyclic voltammograms of EtnFc attached on the N3C11SH-C8SH self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) modified Au electrode shows an E1/2 at 300 mV at 1 Vps scan rate in pH 7 phosphate buffer at room temperature (Fig. ). The ET rate from the Au electrode to the covalently bound EtnFc across the SAM has been determined using chronoamperometry. Chronoamperometry is a very useful tool for the determination of apparent ET rate (kapp) from an electrode to a redox active species bound to various SAMs modified electrode. In CA experiments, the faradaic current decays according to the following exponential relationship. i = kapp Q exp (-kappt) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. (1)  where Q denotes the amount of charge passed during this redox transformation. The CA current decay comprises two types of processes, one for the overall capacitive current decay and the other is due to the faradaic current decay of the attached redox active moiety. The charging current decays very much faster than the faradaic current. This helps to determine the kapp of ET from the electrode to the attached redox active species by simply choosing the appropriate time scale of decay. The plot of Ln(i) vs. time is linear and its slope yields the value of kapp. Chronoamperograms of N3C11SH-C8SH SAM-modified Au electrodes demonstrate a complete decay of charging currents within 0.2 ms time scale (Fig. ) whereas the faradaic currents decay completely at 7.5 ms when EtnFc covalently bound to it (Fig. ). The ET rate from the modified Au electrode to the EtnFc in pH 7 phosphate buffer is determined from the slope of the corresponding semilogarithmic plot of Ln(i) vs. time and is found to be 1030 s -1 which reduced to 575 s -1 when EtnFc bound N3C11SD-C8SD', 'Ln(i) vs. time and is found to be 1030 s -1 which reduced to 575 s -1 when EtnFc bound N3C11SD-C8SD SAMmodified Au electrode in presence of pD7 phosphate buffer(Fig. and). Note that, the proton at the interface can be exchanged slowly and reversibly with deuterium in the bulk solvent and viceversa (Fig. ). The \uf044Ep gradually changes from that of the deuterated SAM to that of the protonated SAM i.e. \uf044Ep of the deuterated SAM in D2O is identical to \uf044Ep of deuterated SAM in H2O solvent before it slowly exchanged. The composition of N3C11SD-C8SD SAM-modified Au electrode remains conserved throughout the entire timescale of experiments (Fig. ). In-situ SERS data of the electrode before, after attachment of EtnFc shows no changes in the SERS data. Similarly, there are no changes in the SERS data when potential is applied in aqueous medium. (Fig. ) XPS data shows similar distribution of HSR/RS -in both of the protonated and deuterated SAM. (Fig. ) Thus, the SERS data together with the XPS data confirms the fact that the environment of the Au-SAM interface does not change upon deuteration. Chronoamperometry is also performed in organic medium (DCM having tetra butyl ammonium perchlorate, TBAP as electrolyte) and it is found that the interfacial ET rate decreases upon deuteration as well. In the case of protonated variant, the ET rate from the SAM modified Au electrode is determined to be 34 s -1 which reduces to 16.75 s -1 when the ET has been done across the deuterated SAM.

"have disabled this feature in our calculations, as leaving it enabled would result in longer optimization trajectories; instead, these calculations are allowed to crash and are therefore omitted from figure 6c. While this feature improves the robustness of the optimization algorithm implemented in Q-Chem, it does so at the cost of longer trajectories for these pathological systems. In this scenario, our optimization algorithm will instead automatically reconstruct a new internal coordinate system, rather than falling back on Cartesian optimization. This results in a robust optimization algorithm similar to Q-Chem, without the additional cost of switching to a Cartesian optimization scheme.We note that while each of the four alternative algorithms resulted in some of the structures failing to converge, we do not consider this to be an appropriate metric for comparison, as the molecules in the test set were specifically chosen to be those that converge in Sella with its default parameters. Consequently, any structures that would It is common in computational studies of molecules to perform scans over specific internal coordinates. These scans are a series of constrained optimizations, which are straightforward when the goal is to minimize the energy with respect to the unconstrained degrees of freedom, e.g., when the scan is done on a minimum energy structure.However, special care must be taken for saddle point scans to ensure that the scan trajectory preserves the structure of the reacting region of the molecule and does not fall into a different saddle point geometry. Our algorithm's implementation of null-space SQP saddle point optimization provides an easy and effective way to scan coordinates.Figure depicts a full 360¬∞scan of a dihedral angle of a 5-exo-tet cyclization reaction saddle point.

We have described these problems and the methods we developed and implemented in Sella to ameliorate them in a previous work. Our algorithm constructs a complete set of internal coordinates by mapping all possible pairs, triplets, and quadruplets of sequentially-bonded atoms from a molecular graph to bond distance, bending angle, and dihedral angle coordinates, respectively. This procedure is described in detail in appendix A.One problem that is frequently encountered when constructing internal coordinate systems is bending angles may become nearly or completely linear. This is a problem because linear bending angles do not have a well-defined Cartesian derivative, and dihedral angle coordinates which contain a linear angle are undefined. This problem is typically solved by manually replacing the pathological angle with one or more new coordinates, usually an improper dihedral or in-and out-of-plane bending angles. However, if the central atom of the pathological angle is only bonded to two other atoms, then it is not possible to define a chemically meaningful improper dihedral to replace the angle. In that case, it is necessary to define a new, so-called ""dummy"" atom, which is used to help define the improper dihedral. For this scenario, we have developed an algorithm for automatically adding dummy atoms to a molecule, potentially even mid-optimization. This is a key aspect of our method, as without automatic reconstruction of internal coordinates, some molecular saddle point optimizations will fail due to the coordinate system becoming ill-defined. To the best of our knowledge, no other optimizer automatically reconstructs the internal', 'and the related algorithms are not efficient for saddle point searches on the potential energy landscapes of sparsely connected atomic systems, such as molecules, because of the strong coupling between atomic degrees of freedom. Molecular optimization (both for minima and saddle points) is generally performed in a basis of internal coordinates, which typically comprise bond stretch distances, bending angles, and dihedral angles, as internal coordinates are significantly less energetically correlated than Cartesian coordinates. These chemically relevant features provide a more effective coordinate system for optimization at the cost of additional algorithmic complexity. We have recently developed a new method for realizing displacements in a basis of redundant internal coordinates which dramatically reduces the number of steps required to reach convergence on a minimization benchmark. In this work, we extend this algorithm to optimization of saddle point geometries.Our optimization algorithm is designed to be used in automated frameworks without the need for manual intervention. However, the complexity of optimization in a basis of internal coordinates frequently frustrates attempts at automation. For example, when a bending angle of a molecule becomes linear or nearly linear during the course of optimization, displacement of the bending angle coordinate becomes ill-defined. To solve this problem, it is necessary to redefine the internal coordinate system to replace the linear bending angle with a different coordinate. Occasionally, this may require the addition of fictional ""dummy atoms"" that act as scaffolding off of which the replacement coordinate can be defined. The process of adding dummy atoms and dealing with the', 'of the saddle point and relative potential energy of the dihedral scan is shown in figure . The orange-highlighted bonds in figure indicate the dihedral angle that is being scanned, which includes several atoms involved in the reaction corresponding to this saddle point. This scan reveals that the structure found by Sella (the structure at zero degrees) is not the lowest-energy conformer for this reaction. This is not surprising, as our saddle point optimization algorithm tends to converge to the saddle point that is geometrically closest to the initial structure, and this may not be the lowest energy conformer.Figure shows how the total number of gradient evaluations required to perform the entire scan (in green) and the number of gradient evaluations per scan step (in red) scale as a function of the number of scan steps used. For this scan, between 12 and 360 steps were used, which corresponds to a dihedral angle step size of between 30¬∞and 1¬∞. Though the total number of gradient evaluations tends to increase with the number of steps used in the scan, the relationship is not perfectly linear. One possible explanation for this is that larger steps in the scan will tend to perturb the unconstrained degrees of freedom more, therefore requiring more gradient evaluations to converge. The upper limit of this plot indicates that when 360 1¬∞steps are used, only 1.61 gradient evaluations are required per grid point. This is very close to the theoretical lower limit of 1 gradient evaluation per step (the dashed red line), in which each step of the scan converges in a single gradient evaluation. Such performance is only possible due to our use of null-space SQP constrained optimization, which projects the gradient to ', 'the replacement coordinate can be defined. The process of adding dummy atoms and dealing with the additional degrees of freedom they bring to the optimization problem poses a difficulty for automation efforts.To address these issues and to enable efficient optimization of molecular saddle points, our algorithm defines internal coordinates and replaces pathological linear bending angles with more well-defined coordinates. If necessary, our algorithm will add dummy atoms to the system automatically at the beginning of the optimization for the purpose of defining new coordinates to replace linear bending angles. Moreover, if previously well-defined bending angles become linear mid-optimization, our algorithm will automatically replace those coordinates without interrupting the optimization procedure. This resolves the common problem of initially well-defined coordinate systems becoming invalid partway through optimization, resulting in a crash or other error.When adding dummy atoms to the optimization problem, our algorithm also adds constraints to counteract the added Cartesian degrees of freedom generated by the dummy atoms. This enables the optimization of a wide range of molecular geometries in an efficient redundant internal coordinate system. This capability renders our algorithm a highly effective and robust geometry optimizer for automated workflows that explore reactive potential energy surfaces, such as KinBot. Further, constrained optimizations, such as relaxed scans, are often used to explore aspects of the potential energy surface and are thus also part of automated workflows.Additionally, the presence of dummy atoms necessitates the addition of constraints, as previously described. However, constrained calculations often fail to converge and are an impediment to automation. To address this challenge, we have implemented constrained saddle point optimization using sequential quadratic', 'a saddle point optimization algorithm in a basis of internal coordinates that requires full evaluations of the Hessian matrix, either analytically or through finite difference. For these codes, the effective number of gradient evaluations is taken to be the number of geometry optimization steps plus a factor of 3n to account for evaluation of the Hessian matrix in full. We note that the cost of evaluating the Hessian matrix using analytical methods -such as coupled-perturbed Hartree-Fock or density functional perturbation theory -is generally lower than the cost of 3n gradient evaluations. However, when analytical Hessians are not available, the actual cost of evaluating the full Hessian matrix will be at least 3n, rising to 6n if central finite difference is used. Based on the result in figure , NWChem, Q-Chem, and Psi4 all show comparable performance to Sella when the Hessian is fully diagonalized. NWChem shows the overall worst performance, likely due to its use of a minimal Z-matrix internal coordinate basis rather than a redundant internal coordinate basis. Nonredundant internal coordinate systems such as the Zmatrix approach necessarily omit some chemically relevant degrees of freedom from the coordinate system, which can have a deleterious impact on optimization performance.As with figure , several of the data points lie below the line, indicating that Sella converges more slowly for these points. This is again likely due to a failure of the diagonalization algorithm to correctly identify the lowest curvature mode, a problem that can be ameliorated by tightening the diagonalization convergence criterion Œ≥.When bending angles become linear mid-optimization, Q-Chem will by default automatically switch to a Cartesian coordinate optimization in order to avoid crashing.We have disabled this feature in our calculations, as leaving it enabled would result in']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Theoretical methods']",2479,1,1,0,0.876175366,3.33E-16,"['why', 'and', 'what']"

Thus, the large, energy-containing eddies lose their energy within one turnover time which is in accordance with turbulent energy cascade theory .Since the impingement zone is the only area in which energy is injected and dissipated, turbulence subsides rapidly afterwards. Therefore, a simple micromixing model is presented that assumes the energy dissipated from the impingement of equal single sheets produces slabs within the impingement zone in which diffusion is the only transport mechanism.

We use a high-energy X-ray probe and a large-area detector to collect the TS signal at grazing-incidence angle with enhanced surface sensitivity. Simultaneously, we use a second largearea detector to collect the SAXS signal. We apply the technique to monitor operando the structural evolution of a copper bismuth oxide film as a model system. CuBi2O4 has recently emerged as a promising PEC material due to its favorable electronic properties, namely a suitable bandgap of 1.6-1.8 eV , p-type conductivity, and a very cathodic onset potential of ca. 1 V vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode). However, the achievable photocurrents from bare CuBi2O4 electrodes are limited by the poor charge carrier mobility and the short carrier diffusion length and decay rapidly in steady-state conditions while at the same time no hydrogen is produced, thus indicating that the measured photoactivity likely restrict to a photocorrosion process. It has been suggested that CuBi2O4 electrodes might degrade similarly to Cu2O during operation, i.e. via consumption of the photogenerated electrons to the reduction of the Cu 2+ cations to either Cu + or Cu 0 .

We measure TS and SAXS simultaneously in grazing incidence to reveal structural modification close to the CuBi2O4-electrolyte interface. We show that under illumination and applied bias the CuBi2O4 electrodes quickly undergo a cathodic photocorrosion process which determines the formation of a segregating metallic Bi phase. This process takes place on a time scale of only few minutes after beginning of the chronoamperometry and correlates with a decrease of around one order of magnitude in the observed photocurrents. Moreover, additional degradation processes occur on slower time scales: formation of metallic Cu and dissolution in the electrolyte as an effect of both anionic photocorrosion and acidic dissolution. The two phenomena cause a steady release of Cu 2+ ions in solution as well as the crystallization of BiPO4 branched structures at the surface of the electrode due to the interaction of the releasing Bi 3+ ions with the phosphate species in the electrolyte. The formation of an insulating BiPO4 layer is likely responsible for the slow decrease in the measured photocurrents at intermediate and later stages of the chronoamperometry.In summary, our study shows that the high-energy X-ray scattering can probe structural information ranging from atomic to nanometer length scales in a realistic experimental environment, thus allowing to simultaneously correlate chemical and morphological modification of the film electrode with changes of photocurrent.

Different approximations to the surprisal are then obtained depending on which operators are kept in the expansion . We show results for the smallest possible closed set of operators where already one obtains physically realistic results, the next larger algebra where the results are accurate to graph plotting accuracy and an even larger algebra where the convergence is rather acceptable.We examine the accuracy of the presented approach on the effects of the coherence between the vibrational and electronic states for two qualitatively different initial pure states:√é(t) = Œª p (t) Bp p ‚àë p l Bp √é(t) = Œª p (t) Bp p ‚àë(a) a coherent superposition of a very few vibrational states with the main population in the state, and (b) a coherent superposition of a larger number of excited vibrational states centered about .

This represents the case when the algebra is not closed.Even so we can identify a few dominant constraints. In section IV.B we discuss the dynamics of ongoing population exchange between two electronic states that are diabatically coupled using a potential that varies linearly with the displacement from equilibrium. The algebra is not closed and yet the dominant constraints capture the dynamics in a quite"", 'that we can then determine the constraints as a function of time. Note that this does not require a closed algebra. The matrix representation is readily adapted to describing the time dependent constraints, , Eq. ( ). The matrix representation of each one of these operators satisfies an equation like Eq. ( ). The matrix that generates the motion in time is the same for all these operators.We validate the implementation of the propagation of the surprisal in the matrix representation Eq. ( ) and Lagrange multipliers defined by Eq. ( ) via comparison with the surprisal obtained using propagation of the equations of motion for the Lagrange multipliers, Eq. ( ). As we start with a pure initial state we perform also an additional benchmark by comparison of the resulting densities and the time-dependent mean values with those calculated from the propagation of the wave function on a grid of the nuclear coordinates.', 'using their commutation relation with the Hamiltonian and can be solved analytically if the set of constraints is closed. This exact approach needs tracking as many constraints as the number of operators needed in a set that is closed upon the commutation with the Hamiltonian. However often in the cases important for dynamical processes that set appears not to be finite and therefore the algebraic route does not provide a simple and compact representation of the surprisal as the dynamics unfold. We here examine a direct way to compute the time-evolution of the surprisal by explicit propagation on a finite, possibly large, basis set. This approach in general provides access to the timedependent surprisal. It can be seen as an alternative way of computing the time-evolution of a quantum mechanical system, and as such it may point the way to approximate treatment of the quantum dynamics.In this digital age, a numerical implementation of quantum mechanics often implies working with a finite, albeit possibly large, basis set. So we often formulate our results below in a finite dimensional space. We point it out when we do it particularly so because when the basis set is finite one can show that there is a large yet finite set of constraints that allow for an exact representation of the surprisal within that space. A general finite basis approach is to implement the computation of the dynamics of the wave function defined on a grid. For a pure state it means propagating a wave packet, the simplest case being a Gaussian. A moving wave packet can describe a reactive collision when the packet initiates in the reactants region. The packet proceeds to the products region while some of it is reflected back to the reactants, e.g., Ref. 25.Such a localized wave packet does not have a sharp energy. A', 'two other derivations of a density matrix that also are of an exponential form like Eq. ( ) but where the motivation is tightly connected to the dynamics. In a theoretical or computational discussion, one often initiates the dynamics from a pure state. But in reality, the initial state is often a mixture and then it makes sense to start from an initial density of maximal entropy subject to those constraints that govern the yet unperturbed state,. For such an initial state we now show that the exact time evolution of the density or of the surprisal is described with a finite number of time-dependent constraints with time independent Lagrange multipliers. The proof requires the unitarity of the time evolution operator and a series expansion of the exponential:(The time-dependent constraints are the terms in the curly brackets, and there are as many time-dependent constraints as the number of constraints in the initial state. In section III we discuss how to compute directly the surprisal:The method of computing the surprisal can also be applied should we wish to obtain explicit expressions for the individual time-dependent constraints.We next come to a simpler but more specialized result. It is valid for the special case when the dynamics of the constraints are closed under commutation relation with the Hamiltonian.In such a limiting situation the exact time evolution can be described with a finite number of time-independent constraints but with time dependent Lagrange multipliers with known equations of motion.

In particular we identify leading or 'dominant' constraints. This approximate treatment follows the spirit of the information theory approach -description of the density matrix using only a partial but essential knowledge about the system.To discuss systems with more than a few degrees of freedom a large basis is needed for numerical convergence. So exact propagation of the surprisal on a finite basis will be computationally demanding. However, the dynamics of the Lagrange multipliers of the dominant constraints may be sufficient for most purposes. This opens a different way of approximating the quantum dynamics in many-body systems, a subject for future research.In section II we show that if the initial state of a system is described as a state of maximal entropy, a finite set of time-dependent constraints is sufficient to reproduce the surprisal at all subsequent times. During a unitary time-evolution the rank of the density matrix is conserved so the number of the time-dependent constraints is the same as the number of constraints on the initial state. In section II we further describe the special circumstances where an algebraically delineated finite set of time-independent constraints is sufficient to describe the dynamics. The algebraic procedure to convert the dynamics of the surprisal to a compact evolution of the Lagrange multipliers is introduced. Section III discusses the proposed computational scheme for an exact dynamical evolution of the surprisal in a finite dimensional space. The computation of the time evolution in such a space is exact because we show that there is always a large but finite set of time-independent constraints that is closed under commutation with the Hamiltonian.

"Screening of Nonadiabatic DynamicsBased on their promising ligand-field splitting, we performed nonadiabatic dynamics simulations for the complexes [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -(4), VCl 3 (im-im-im) (11), [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] - (12), and VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi) (18) using the SH/LVC approach. As for VCl 3 (ddpd) (A, see Section 2.1), the potentials are parametrized at the CASSCF level of theory and corrected by using the CASPT2 vertical excitation energies in place of the CASSCF ones. For the newly designed complexes as well as for VCl 3 (ddpd), SH/LVC simulations of an ensemble of 200 trajectories were first propagated for a simulation time of 20 ps. For the complexes, that still exhibited larger singlet population, the simulation time was extended to 100 ps. All dynamics were initiated from a Wigner distribution around the triplet minimum geometry by excitation into the first absorption band The resulting time evolution of the diabatic electronic state populations that describe the excited-state dynamics of all complexes is shown by the thin lines in Figure . The diabatic states are states characterized by fixed electronic configurations, for which, in the present analysis, we use the electronic states at the triplet minimum geometry of each complex. In order to propose a kinetic model to explain the time evolution of the diabatic electronic state populations, we analyzed the individual pathways of a set of 100 trajectories through the different electronic states for each complex, see Section S5. Following this analysis, we identified reaction networks (discussed below) and, based on these, fitted exponential population curves; they are shown as thick lines in Figure <ref type=""figure""",Causal,Why was the simulation time extended to 100 ps for the complexes that still exhibited larger singlet populations?,Answer not available from the given context. ,Negative,"['For the complexes, that still exhibited larger singlet population, the simulation time was extended to 100 ps.']","[[642, 752]]","['drops to almost zero for [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and VCl 3 (im-im-im), see Figure .

In this figure, states which are populated at the start of the dynamics simulations are shown at the top with labels above them denoting the initial population in percentage, e.g., 54% for the  Hypothesis I was based on the assumption that increasing the ligand-field splitting could destabilize the 3 A 2 states belonging to the e 2 g configuration. This could quench the internal conversion from the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ states to the 3 A 2 states, which is the main com-peting pathway to the intersystem crossing populating the singlet states in VCl 3 (ddpd). As can be seen, this assumption is realized in the dynamics of [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -, [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, and VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), where T 1 ‚Ä≤ --‚Üí 3 A 2 internal conversion is either completely quenched ([VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -) or its importance reduced to a few percentage. In contrast, for VCl 3 (im-im-im), internal conversion to the 3 A 2 states becomes the almost sole deactivation pathway from the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ states. Nevertheless, however, more population reaches the singlet states for VCl 3 (im-im-im) (48%) compared to VCl 3 (ddpd) (43%), as the singlet states now receive population from the 3 T 2 states. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the pathway populating the singlet states in each of the four designed complexes is different from that of VCl 3 (ddpd), where all population entering the singlets is received from the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ states. For [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and for [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, the singlet states are populated from the 3 DL states that possess ligandcentered excitation character, while for VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), the singlet states are', 'Among the 18 candidates complexes, we identified four complexes with ligandfield splitting larger than VCl 3 (ddpd). In the second step, we then performed long-time nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. For the four complexes, we could observe similar or larger transfer of electronic population via intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet states when compared to VCl 3 (ddpd). For two of the complexes, [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -and VCl 3 (im-im-im), reverse intersystem crossing subsequently depopulated the singlet states on a 20 ps time scale making them non-promising candidates for near-infra emission despite their large ligand-field splitting. For the other two complexes, however, we found long-lived singlet population that remains constant even after 100 ps simulation time. For VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), this population of ca. 7% is of the same size as that for the reference VCl 3 (ddpd) complex (9%). For [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, in turn, the long-lived singlet population is almost doubled to 16%, i.e., making it a promising candidate for efficient 3d-metal based near-infrared emitters.While following our hypothesis resulted in a success in the screening, the detailed analysis of the relaxation mechanisms of VCl 3 (ddpd) and the four designed complexes revealed a complex picture. Despite nominally featuring electronic states of similar character, each complex displayed a unique reaction network in its photodynamics. This suggested that the success in the screening did not originate by following the assumption of our hypothesis, but rather resulted from some other, more individual electronic-structure features. In conclusion, the excited-state decay pathways of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes are complicated due to the large number of participating electronic states. Consequently, the effect of changing the ligand on their mechanisms are both difficult to predict and not obvious just from static electronic calculations. Instead, insights from more vanadium(III)', 'ConclusionThe combination of trajectory surface hopping on potentials parametrized in the linear vibronic coupling model is an efficient approach to perform photodynamics simulations. For transition metal complexes, despite their typically large number of vibrational degrees of freedom and many close-lying electronic states, it becomes affordable to screen the nonadiabatic dynamics of many individual ones in order to test and establish design principles to improve their photophysical and photochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate this by screening the photophysics of open-shell vanadium(III) complexes derived from VCl 3 (ddpd). This complex, after excitation from the triplet ground state and following intersystem crossing to the singlet manifold, shows singlet-to-triplet phosphorescence in the nearinfrared region. Based on an analysis of the relaxation mechanism of VCl 3 (ddpd), we developed the hypothesis that by increasing the ligand-field strength in the complex could shift the electronic states to modify the mechanism in such a way as to lead to a higher phosphorescence yield. This was to be achieved by channeling more population from the triplet to the singlet states as well as reducing the amount of singlet-to-triplet reverse intersystem crossing that reduces the population available for phosphorescence.We then tested our hypothesis in two steps. First, we designed 18 complexes based on design principles established for other 3dmetal complexes with large ligand-field splitting. Thereby we found that strategies of including ligands that are strong œÉ -donors or both œÉ and œÄ donors are particularly successful. Among the 18 candidates complexes, we identified four complexes with ligandfield splitting', 'Fig. 1 (1Fig. 1 (a) Photodynamics of VCl 3 (ddpd).

That shift, however, is smaller than the width of either the bulk or the interfacial VIE distribution. We therefore conclude that interfacial VIE distributions are essentially indistinguishable from their bulk counterparts, for both I -(aq) and SCN -(aq).C. Analysis of Short-Range Structure. We have documented that two solvation shells of explicit water molecules is enough to provide converged VIEs when appropriate boundary conditions are employed, and that VIEs computed for anions at the air/water interface differ from their bulk counterparts (if at all) by a shift that is comparable to (or smaller than) the inhomogeneous broadening of the VIE distribution. This implies that any shift in the VIE for X -(aq) between the bulk and interfacial environments is hardly distinguishable from thermal fluctuations. Taken together with the rapid convergence of the VIE with respect to explicit water, this would seem to suggest that the short-range ion-water hydrogen bonding around X -(aq) might not be that different at the air/water interface as compared to the bulk aqueous environment.

In the former case, there is a cluster of data near d GDS = 0, consistent with the surface propensity of I -(aq), however the corresponding VIEs are spread over a range that is not dissimilar from the spread of the entire data set. This is consistent with the similarity between bulk and interfacial VIE distributions that was documented in Fig. . It is difficult to see any correlations at all in the n HB versus VIE data. While transient fluctuations in the hydrogen-bond network are no doubt the origin of the inhomogeneous broadening of the VIE distribution, it is not so simple as saying that fewer hydrogen bonds to the ion implies a larger or smaller VIE, especially with a metric that discretizes the ion's hydra- tion shell into an integer number of hydrogen bonds.In previous MD simulations of halide ions A -(aq) at the air/water interface, Jungwirth and Tobias reported that the larger halides exhibit distinctive differences in terms of how their ion-water hydrogen bonds are oriented with respect to the surface normal, when compared to the same ions in bulk water.

In the HC scheme, the grid approach was used to sample points from the low-level dataset. This method is efficient for the tri-atom F + H2 system, but is unfeasible for larger systems due to the exponential growth of the number of data points with the system size. Bowman and co-workers used root mean square (RMS) bond difference between two configurations as the criterion to select points near the equilibrium of stationary points and chose a random integer that indicated their position on a list of the remaining points to select points in other regions, which produced a subset that spans the same range of configurations as the original DFT dataset. A small number of configurations were needed to reproduce the key properties around the equilibrium of the stationary points or along the MEP. However, this sampling method is prohibitively expensive for the title reaction with a large configuration space and it\'s desirable to sample points efficiently to make the correction PES ŒîVHL-LL converged with fewer high-level energies.It\'s well known that the NN-based potentials are represented by nonlinear ""non-physical"" functions and have limited extrapolation capabilities.

Their energies range from -40 to 120 kcal mol -1 , relative to the reactant asymptote. These points were labeled as ""the entire dataset"" and were fitted by the PIP-NN method.

Then, according to the strategy described above, ca. 10700 points It should be stressed that the performance of the low-level DFT method is essential. The smaller the difference between the low-level DFT and the high-level CCSD(T)-F12a, the cheaper the cost to develop the correction PES. Hence, we carried out tests on various DFT methods and the corresponding results were summarized in Table . First, the selected lowlevel DFT method should cover the same configuration space as the high level. Or else, the entire dataset, sampled according to the DFT level, may be not sufficient for the final PES at the target level. Second, the difference between the DFT method and the CCSD(T)-F12a should have the same trend throughout for the entire data. Or else, the correction model may be not fitted well due to the rugged differences. Further, some high-energy regions may be not readily included in common PIP-NN PESs, but are important for quantum', 'the ith and jth correction PES, respectively. The energy differences of each remaining point in the DFT dataset were calculated. Then the first 300 points with the biggest energy deviations were added to the training dataset for the correction PES. Note that the generalized Euclidean distance was again used to exclude points that are close to each other. The procedure mentioned above was iterated to gradually improve the correction PES until the final PES can provide converged dynamical results and reproduce the key properties, such as geometries, frequencies, and energies of all stationary points, compared to the target high-level UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ calculation. 38.89 (-37.79 with the zero-point vibrational energy ZPEcorrection) kcal mol -1 at the UCCSD(T)-F12a/AVTZ level.

The energy released by the impingement is dissipated within approximately one turnover time of the largest eddies. As a result, micromixing was studied using a simple model that assumes diffusion of species in slabs of fixed thickness (2ùêø), which are generated within the impingement zone. The experimental study followed the progress of an acid-base neutralization containing a fluorophore. A simulation, which included a module for calculating the fluorescence, determined 2ùêø for experimental energy dissipation rates (ùúñ) ranging from 5x10 3 to 7.7x10 6 W/kg. 2ùêø was found to lie in the range of turbulence dissipative scales less than the Taylor microscale but greater than the Kolmogorov microscale (ùúÇ). Additionally, the results provided a clear definition of the large eddy Reynolds number (ùëÖùëí ùõ¨ ) of impinging sheets which previously was uncertain . 2ùêø/ùë£‚Ä≤ was found to be a function of ùëÖùëí ùõ¨ -1/4 and (ùúà ùúñ ‚ÅÑ ) 1/2 , where ùë£‚Ä≤ is the velocity associated with the turbulent kinetic energy and ùúà is the kinematic viscosity.

Although that study only included a single impingement angle of 30¬∞, the flowrate was varied by a factor of 27 from a total flowrate of 2.8 L/min to 76 L/min.Figure is a reproduction of Figure in reference . The micromixing-sensitive product distribution, ùëã ùë† , is plotted as a function of the mixing modulus, M, which is given by:ùëÄ = ùëò 2 ùëê ùêµùëú ùõø 2 ùê∑ ‚ÅÑ (52)where ùëò 2 is the reaction rate constant for the rate limiting step of the competitive-consecutive reactions, ùëê ùêµùëú is the initial concentration of diazotized sulfanilic acid, Œ¥ is a representative length scale for diffusion (equal to the half slab thickness in this study), and D is the diffusion coefficient of diazotized sulfanilic acid. Eq. 52 is essentially the ratio of the characteristic time required for diffusion (Œ¥ 2 /D) to the characteristic time required for the reaction [(ùëò 2 ùëê ùêµùëú ) -1 ]. At that time, the microscale for the high-viscosity data points was set approximately equal to a scale (ùúÜ/2), where ùúÜ was deduced by setting the energy dissipation rate equal to the viscous dissipation rate (see Eq. 32).

A simple micromixing model was employed to determine the fixed slab thickness for diffusion of acid and base within the mixed sheet. The diffusion slab thickness, 2ùêø, was found to lie between the Taylor microscale, ùúÜ ùëî , and an order of magnitude dissipative microscale, [ùúÜ = ùúÜ ùëî /(15) 0.5 ], but well above the Kolmogorov microscale, ùúÇ. Similar to the Kolmogorov microscale, the ratio of 2ùêø to the large energy-containing eddy size, ùõ¨, is a function of the Reynolds number of the largest eddies (ùëÖùëí ùõ¨ ) to the -3/4 power. Similar to ùúÜ ùëî and ùúÜ, the ratio of the slab thickness to the velocity of the turbulent kinetic energy (ùë£\') is a function of (ùúà ùúñ ‚ÅÑ ) 1/2 , where ùúà is the kinematic viscosity and ùúñ is the energy dissipation rate. However, 2ùêø ùë£‚Ä≤ ‚ÅÑ is also a function of the Reynolds number of the large energy-containing eddies to the -1/4 power. If these results are used for other systems, it is recommended that ùê∂ ùúñ in Eq. 50 be set equal to ùê∂ ùúñùê¥ (= 0.5).The results also verified the relationship of the dimensionless dissipation rate coefficient, ùê∂ ùúñ , with the energy dissipation rate that was found in the study on the volume of the energy dissipation zone . When the reference energy dissipation rate (ùúñ ùêºùëç ), calculated based on a volume equal to the impingement zone volume, is ‚â• 3x10 4 W/kg, the actual energy dissipation rate equals ùúñ ùêºùëç .

Measurements of the radial velocity profile in the impingement zone have shown that the velocity changes from the single sheet velocity (ùë¢) at the beginning of the impingement zone to the mixed sheet velocity (ùë£ ùëö ) by the time liquid reaches the end of the impingement zone . It was also demonstrated that the large-eddy turnover time is approximately equal to the residence time of liquid in the impingement zone. Thus, the large, energy-containing eddies lose their energy within one turnover time which is in accordance with turbulent energy cascade theory .Since the impingement zone is the only area in which energy is injected and dissipated, turbulence subsides rapidly afterwards. Therefore, a simple micromixing model is presented that assumes the energy dissipated from the impingement of equal single sheets produces slabs within the impingement zone in which diffusion is the only transport mechanism. Since turbulence is damped within one large-scale eddy turnover time, stretching of lamella or vortices is assumed to be negligible and the generated diffusive slabs are, therefore, of fixed thickness. The model assumes perfect macromixing in the impingement zone, which implies that a slab of acid (ùê¥) is next to a slab of base (ùêµ) at all times.The general component mass transfer equation (on a molar basis) is given by:ùúïùëê ùëñ ùúïùë° + ‚àá ‚Ä¢ ùëÅ ùëñ -ùëÖ ùëñ = 0(9)where ‚àá ‚Ä¢ ùëÅ ùëñ is the divergence of the molar flux of component ùëñ, ùë° is time, ùëê ùëñ is the molar', 'occurs depends upon the system. However, Dimotakis has found for a wide variety of flows, including shear layers and jets, that a Reynolds number based on the Taylor microscale can be used to determine when fully-developed turbulence is achieved . Fully-developed turbulence requires a minimum Taylor Reynolds number of approximately 100 to 140. For the azo-coupling experiments, the Taylor Reynolds number ranged from 20 to 171. Fully-developed turbulence was only achieved for five out of 29 results and those results were for relatively thick single sheets (250 to 1300 ¬µm) at large mixed-sheet flow rates to 76 L/min). Thus, the Kolmogorov microscale was used for some of the results where the flow was not fully-developed turbulence. Further, the azocoupling study was unable to correlate the Reynolds number with the micromixing other than a general statement regarding laminar flow, transition flow and fully-developed turbulence.The azo-coupling micromixing study investigated a wide range of mixed sheet flow rates (2.8 to 76 L/min) but only at a single impingement angle of 30 degrees. In addition, the low-flowrate experiments (2.8 to 5.6 L/min) studied viscosities ranging from 1 to 12 cP. Calculated energy dissipation rates ranged from 6.2 x 10 3 to 1.2 x 10 6 W/kg. In this study, the micromixing resulting from impinging sheets was studied by following the neutralization of dilute aqueous NaOH with dilute aqueous HCl using a fluorescent indicator. The fluorescence intensity along a radial line in the mixed sheet was measured from photographs using ImageJ software . From the fluorescence intensity vs time profiles, the diffusive slab thickness was determined and related to dissipation microscales of turbulence as well as the Reynolds number. A wider range of impingement angles (28 to 105 degrees) was studied at mixed sheet flow rates up to 6 L/min.

The yellow component contains alkali metals and Ag, Tl and H (oxidation state I), which are similar because of their arsenates, sulphates, nitrates, carbonates, chlorides and iodides. Note that even if elements of a component are connected by sequences of similarities, it does not follow that two non-adjacent elements of a component hold a high degree of similarity. This is a consequence of the lack of transitivity of similarity relations . For example, in the blue component Zr is similar to Si, as they form compounds where their oxidation state is IV, e.g. XO 2 , XCl 4 . Likewise, Si and Ti are similar, as well as Ti and Sn. However, Ti and Sn are also similar because of their compounds with oxidation state II. If we keep following the similarity arrows, the presence of oxidation state II becomes stronger, while that of IV winds down.Of the similarity relations (Figure ), those of organogenic elements are the weakest ones, as these elements only share less than 3% of their large sets of arranged formulae with their most similar elements. The strongest similarities occur for Rb, Cs, La, Se, Br, Li, Be, Pd and Tl, which share more than 50% of their arranged formulae with their most similar elements. In fact, for only less than half of the formulae of 85% of the elements, they can be replaced by their most similar element.', 'Chemical space: provider of order and similarityIn the 1860s chemists ordered elements by their atomic weights. Mendeleev, in his second 1869 publication about the system, discussed the pros and cons of selecting other properties as ordering criterion, e.g. electrochemical properties, relative affinities and valency . Mendeleev settled on atomic weight, mainly based upon its invariability across all substances containing a particular element. Compounds were central for atomic weight determinations, which resulted from finding the smallest common weight of a large set of compounds containing the reference element. Similarity among elements was addressed through chemical resemblance, which for Meyer was captured through common valency in compounds. Mendeleev commented upon physical properties such as optical, electrical or magnetic ones and vapour densities , but discarded them for their variability over compounds of the same element. He was after a property related to the essential presence of an element in its compounds, which moved him to analyse chemical properties such as acidity or alkalinity of oxides. However, they were ruled out because of the several amphoteric oxides. Mendeleev ended up taking substance composition as the proxy for similarity, which boils down to the valency, selected by Meyer. ""Thus the fluorine group contains elements which preferentially combine with a single atom of hydrogen, the oxygen group with two, the nitrogen group with three, and the carbon group with four atoms of hydrogen or chloride"" , Mendeleev claimed. Thus, compounds provided order and similarity to the system.', ""This justifies the almost invariable resemblances among chemical elements reported by Meyer and Mendeleev and others and the difficulty in finding stable similarities for transition metals , characterised by few compounds, therefore requiring a more complete knowledge of the space.Meyer's and Mendeleev's idea of a book concentrating the most salient features of mid 19th century chemical knowledge, from which the periodic system arose, could have concentrated their content on oxoacid salts, halides, sulphides, simple carbon oxygenated compounds, ammonia derivatives and oxides, which are the carriers of most of the similarities among chemical elements. The challenge is writing the book of chemistry for the contemporary available space and to explore the influence of the current space upon the periodic system. Is it still there?

The question arising is on the ratio between the number of compounds and of combinations for each element.

As with TIPS-Pn, the averaged and normalized 0.05 mM TA data show minimal shape change over 8 ns (Fig. )), indicating that this spectrum predominantly contains singlet excitons, with minimal SF, ISC, or excimer formation. The decay of the spectrum fits well to a single exponential with a 12.7 ¬± 0.2 ns time constant (Sec. S5.1 of the supplementary material). This time constant is reasonably consistent with the 13.2 ns singlet lifetime of TIPS-Tn in anhydrous toluene previously reported by and the 11.6 ns lifetime in chloroform reported by In contrast, the 8 mM TIPS-Tn TA spectrum shows some shape change over time (Fig. ).The difference is less prominent than for TIPS-Pn, but there is a clear emergence of a peak at ‚àº510 nm, concurrent with decreases in the amplitudes of S 1 features (relative to the GSB). We assign this peak to the absorbance of TIPS-Tn triplet excitons, consistent with the visible T 1 absorbance of other tetracene derivatives. Again, since no significant triplet formation was observed in the dilute TIPS-Tn solution, this triplet formation in the more concentrated solution must be due to SF.', 'species such as a triplet-pair intermediate or excimer state is unnecessary to fit the data. This result is reasonable for SF in solution,as the triplet excitons are able to separate easily as molecules diffuse away from each other, and so any intermediate species would be short-lived. The extracted concentrations of S 1 and T 1 of TIPS-Pn from this fit are shown in Fig. (a). The lower bound of the triplet concentration comes from the upper bound of the T 1 basis spectrum. This result corresponds to the upper bound on the S 1 concentration. The yield of triplet excitons at 8 ns was calculated as c T 1 (8 ns)/c S 1 (0 ns) and is between 19 and 27%.For 8 mM TIPS-Tn, the deconvolution fits reproduce the TA data well at all wavelengths and times (Figs. S23 and S24 of the supplementary material). As with TIPS-Pn, a third component is unnecessary to fit the data at this concentration. This result is in apparent contradiction to TA data of TIPS-Tn in toluene by and Dover et al. , who resolved an excimer component from the TA data in addition to the triplet and singlet excitons. As will be discussed in more detail later, this disagreement is potentially explained by the significantly higher concentration of 300 mM used in these studies (37.5 times higher than the 8 mM solution used here). We speculate that this concentration may begin to approach the solubility limit of TIPS-Tn in toluene and result in the formation of aggregates in solution. Excimers potentially result from this aggregate formation, and are therefore undetected in more dilute solutions. The resulting concentrations of S 1 and T 1 are shown in Fig. 3(b), where the upper bound of T 1 and lower bound of S 1 concentrations correspond to the lower bound of the T 1 basis spectrum. The yield of triplets excitons at 8 ns for 8 mM TIPS-Tn is between 17 and 27%.', 'is due to excimer formation, rather than SF. Only about 3% of singlet excitons undergo SF to form T 1 . Additionally, a maximum T 1 yield of only 1.25% is observed, because most of the triplets formed rapidly undergo triplet fusion. A significant amount of excimer formation is predicted by the Dover model at 8 mM (34%), but, as discussed previously, the TA data fits well to just two components (S 1 and T 1 ) without additional absorption or emission that could be due to excimers. It is possible that the spectral component we assign to T 1 could instead be due to excimers, but, as we show in Fig. of the supplementary material, the spectral shape is consistent with previously assigned T 1 basis spectra. Additionally, the excimer state is emissive, but there is an absence of any obvious emission features in the basis spectrum that correspond to the excimer emission characterized by Dover et al.. Instead, we attribute the discrepancy between the Dover model and the TA data in this study to the concentrations of TIPS-Tn used. Both Dover et al. and Stern et al. used concentrations of 300 mM, 37.5 times higher than the 8 mM samples used here. We observed that agitation is required to dissolve 8 mM solutions of TIPS-Tn in toluene, and therefore propose that at a concentration of 300 mM TIPS-Tn may only be partially soluble, and consequently that aggregation may begin to occur at that concentration.Excimer formation may be facilitated by these aggregates, and is therefore absent at more dilute concentrations. Aggregate formation would explain why the decay of the S 1 state at 8 mM is overestimated by the Dover model. If SF or excimer formation were due to aggregates rather than, or in addition to, collisions between molecules, then the pseudo-first-order SF rate constants at 300 mM would not scale linearly with concentration, and the bimolecular rate constant would no longer be applicable. Using the rate constants fit to a', 'target=""#b7"">8 Given the solubility of TIPS-Pn in toluene is similar to chloroform, we expect that aggregation was absent in the solutions studied here.For TIPS-Tn, the singlet decay rate constant, k S 1 , was fixed to 1/12.7 ns -1 (taken from the relaxation lifetime of the singlet excited state in the dilute solution in Sec. S4.1 of the supplementary material) minus the ISC and SF contributions (k ISC and k SF √ó 0.05 mM). The triplet decay rate constant was fixed to 1/80 ¬µs -1 , taken from the lifetime used by Dover et al.. Again, the triplet lifetime is substantially longer than the timescales measured here, and has little effect on the fit.The resulting kinetic model fits are shown in Fig. , where again the shaded gray region represents the range of possible kinetics that fit the triplet concentration. This model is able to capture the behavior of TIPS-Tn reasonably well. The triplet formation kinetics are reproduced well, and the singlet decay has some small discrepancies, which, as with TIPS-Pn, we attribute to solvent reorganization or the presence of some additional S 1 deactivation pathways.

"Algorithmic and technical detailsThe conformational entropy calculation as described above is performed with the recently published CREST program. A special run type was implemented for this purpose, where the focus is set to an extensive sampling around the global and low-lying local minima.Ideally the calculation of S conf should be conducted from the already known global minimum conformer, e.g., obtained from another conformational search with default settings in CREST. The enantiomer degenaracy number g i is obtained automatically as described in detail the Supporting Information. For the msRRHO part, any quantum chemical method or even force-fields can be applied. Here, we use the composite DFT method B97-3c and the well-known B3LYP-D3 functional in a standard def2-TZVP basis.  Note that for large systems step two could in principle also be conducted at a low theory level (SQM or FF). However, because step three is usually the computational bottleneck, it is recommended to take S msRRHO from a more accurate DFT treatment. In general, this partitioning allows systematic improvements of the scheme because the different contributions can in principle be calculated at any level of theory.If no low-lying conformers (relative energy <1-2 kcal/mol at ambient temperature) are found in the first step, the entropy run is not necessary and the plain S msRRHO value can be taken. The default setup for the metadynamics bias potentials in the entropy mode and further technical settings were empirically determined on a few test cases similar to the optimization of the run parameters in a conventional conformer search run <ref type=""bibr""",Causal,Why was a special run type implemented in the CREST program focusing on extensive sampling around the global and low-lying local minima?,Answer not available from the given context. ,Negative,"['A special run type was implemented for this purpose, where the focus is set to an extensive sampling around the global and low-lying local minima.

Note that the MD runs are by default initiated with random numbers and hence the details of the obtained CE vary stochastically. For larger, very flexible molecules with a complicated PES this can amount to stochastic variations of 2-5% for S conf (see also Section 4.4 for discussion).The general workflow for the computation of S conf in CREST is outlined in Fig. Ideally, the PES employed for the initial conformational search and the one used for automatic S conf calculation should be the same. Here, we employ the GFN2-xTB tight-binding method and the recent general force-field GFN-FF and compare the results. The latter speeds-up the CREST calculations by a factor of 10-30 for typical cases with 50-100 atoms. The S msRRHO value is always computed with B97-3c and a frequency scaling factor ŒΩ scal of 0.97, or B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP with a frequency scaling factor ŒΩ scal of 0.98. Test calculations employing GFN2-xTB in this step yield somewhat less accurate results without reducing the overall computational times significantly. In all frequency calculations, a S msRRHO cut-off value of œÑ = 25 cm -1 was employed. œÑ and ŒΩ scal (for the DFT methods)were adjusted to perform equally well in combination with both GFN-FF and GFN2-xTB.CREST is essentially a driver for the xtb program which is used for all GFN calculations.For the DFT calculations, TURBOMOLE 7.4 is used throughout.', 'that the conformer-rotamer ensembles (CRE) obtained from CREST are sufficiently complete and the energies E i are accurate. If this is really the case for very flexible molecules (e.g. long alkanes) can be tested by comparison of computed and experimental entropies and heat capacities (see Sec. 4.2 and 4.3). Note that our approach works with any (on-the-fly computed) PES and hence, at least in principle, the errors introduced by the underlying method for the PES and the other approximations to the entropy problem could be decomposed.The CREST algorithms were originally developed to generate rotamer containing ensembles and the related nuclei-exchange information for the simulation of NMR spectra . Hence, it seems straightforward not only to identify rotamers, but to extend the algorithm to automatically compute the proper degeneracy number g i . However, as mentioned above, conformer ensembles (CE) must be free from the indistinguishable rotamers to be compatible with entropy calculations. Therefore, g i are treated as unity in the usual case.The only exception here are symmetrical molecules that can form ""enantiomeric"" (i.e., in principle distinguishable) conformers through rotation of bonds. A typical case is the gauche conformer of n-butane. These geometrical enantiomers are degenerate and would be falsely classified as rotamers in our previous implementation. Effectively, this introduces a factor of g i = {1, 2} instead of g i in the degeneracy, depending on if the formation of a geometrical enantiomer is possible. Our new apprach considers this problem for the first time in a correct and automated way. Inserting this into the standard entropy expression for degenerate states leads toS conf = R ln g i e -E i Œ≤ + g i (E i Œ≤)e -E i Œ≤ g i e -E i Œ≤ .(10)The correct S msRRHO entropy is a population average over the', 'and further anharmonicity effects mainly in the high-frequency part. The only two empirical parameters included are adjusted to reproduce experimental entropies for a benchmark set of mostly rigid molecules (see below). For better destinction this modified RRHO treatment is in the following denoted by S msRRHO (""s"" for scaled).The major aim of this work was to find a robust approximation to S conf which is already sigificant for medium flexible molecules (see section 4.4). We build upon the original idea of Gilson and co-workers termed ""minima mining"" or ""mixture of conformers"" strategy, which has later been applied to organic molecule entropy calculations by DeTar 31 and Guthrie .The basic formula readsS conf ‚âà S mix = -R conf i p i ln p i(8)and approximates S conf by the conformer mixing entropy S mix summed over a conformer ensemble. The thermal populations p at absolute temperature T are given byp i = g i e -E i Œ≤ g i e -E i Œ≤ ,(9)where Œ≤ = 1 kT , E i is the energy of the equilibrium structure of conformer i, and g i is a general state degeneracy. The conformational entropy depends on the level of theory through the calculated populations entering the Gibbs-Shannon entropy formulation in Eq. 8, which in turn depend directly on the equilibrium (free) energies. But also for other configurational entropy approaches, that are usually cited as being purely informational, there exists a bias towards the underlying method used for the generation of molecular structures, for example by MD simulations. This is especially problematic for very crude approximations of the conformational entropy, e.g., based only on the number of conformers N conf according to S conf ‚âà R ln (N conf ).', 'i Œ≤ .(10)The correct S msRRHO entropy is a population average over the CE, analogously to other physical observables. Unfortunately, the many costly DFT geometry optimizations and frequency calculations will quickly become the computational bottleneck for moderately sized systems. Therefore, as a further approximation, we compute S msRRHO at the DFT level for the lowest conformer and add the respective ensemble contribution as a thermostatistical average over all populated conformers at a less computationally demanding, lower theoretical level. The arising S msRRHO term is given byS msRRHO = p i S msRRHO,i -S msRRHO,ref ,(11)where S msRRHO,i is the absolute msRRHO entropy of the conformer calculated at the low force-field or SQM level to avoid very many (high level/DFT) HO calculations. S msRRHO,i and the free energies (G i ) are only explicitly calculated for the lowest ‚â• 90% populated (based on initial total energies E i ) conformers while for all others, the average is taken. The populations p i refer to Eq. 9 and are calculated using G i from the corresponding msRRHO calculations. For convenience, we subtract the entropy of a reference structure S msRRHO,ref inEq. 11 such that S msRRHO can be added directly taken as a further correction to the S mRRHO result taken from any standard quantum chemistry code. S msRRHO,ref typically refers to the DFT reference structure, for which vibrational frequencies are calculated at the SQM or FF level. To avoid changes to the geometry and appearance of imaginary vibrational modes, we here additionally make use of a new procedure called Single Point Hessian (SPH), for which some details are given in the Supporting Information, but will be published elsewhere. Note that if S msRRHO is calculated at the same level as S msRRHO , one would arrive at the correct population average because S msRRHO', 'better description of the PES. The modular partition of the absolute value into ro-vibrational and configurational parts enables a convenient replacement of the different methods, which provides a starting point for future studies.

For consistency, the same DFT methodology as used for Al 1-x Gd x N alloy calculations is adopted for the Tb and Pr analogues.

We also considered a layered hexagonal-BN like structure of the alloys, but we find it to be energetically unfavorable as compared to the wurtzite and rocksalt structures over the full compositional range (Figure ). continuity in the spinodal line at x c is due to the incommensurate lattices of wurtzite and rocksalt, requiring a reconstructive phase transition.

First-principles calculations using density functional theory in conjunction with SQS supercells reveal that the critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82. The calculated mixing free energy indicates that at equilibrium conditions and at temperatures below 1000 K, there is a large miscibility gap and only a few percent of Gd can be incorporated in AlN. Higher (effective) temperatures that can be accessed with non-equilibrium growth methods will enable higher Gd incorporation.

Although numbers of studies have associated inter-organelle communication with cancer, there are few approaches to reveal or manipulate proteins to mitochondria in cancer cells.

This intriguing discovery stimulates us to explore the use of EISA for manipulating a nuclear protein, H2B, to the mitochondria of cancer cells.As a core histone protein, H2B normally forms nucleosomes with nuclear DNA after its synthesis in cytoplasm and is absent from mitochondria. It is, however, possible for H2B to be in the mitochondria of dysregulated cells, such as cancer cells. In fact, proteomic analysis of a liver cancer cell has indicated that histones H2A and H2B are present in the mitochondrial membrane as integral membrane proteins and not bound directly to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inside the mitochondria. But it remains unclear how the histone proteins locate at mitochondria. A recent survey of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) shows that negatively charged peptide sequences are a common feature of histone-interacting proteins. <ref', 'Enzyme-Instructed Assemblies Enable Mitochondria Localization of Histone H2B in Cancer Cells It is known that a highly dynamic communication among subcellular organelles (e.g., cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and nucleus) dictate cellular behaviors. But little information exists on how the interorganelle crosstalk impacts cancer cells due to the lack of approaches that manipulate inter-organelle communication in cancer cells. We unexpectedly found that a negatively charged, enzyme cleavable peptide enables the trafficking of histone protein (H2B), a nuclear protein, to the mitochondria in cancer cells. The peptide, denoted as MitoFlag, interacts with the nuclear location sequence (NLS) of H2B to block it entering nucleus. A protease on the mitochondria cleaves the Flag from the complex of MitoFlag and H2B to form assemblies that retain H2B on the mitochondria and facilitate the H2B entering mitochondria. Molecular validation of MitoFlag shows that adding NLS, replacing aspartic acid residues by glutamic acid residues, or changing L-aspartic acid to D-aspartic residue abolishes the trafficking of H2B into mitochondria of HeLa cells. As the first example of enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) of a synthetic peptide for trafficking endogenous proteins, this work provides insights for understanding and manipulating inter-organelle communication in cells.', ') indicates that MitoFlag(L-D) mainly undergoes proteolysis on mitochondria. This aggregate-to-nanofiber transformation increases local viscosity and retains H2B on mitochondria. Unlike MitoFlag(L-D), MitoFlag(L-E) inefficiently undergoes such transformation (Figure. S10), and MitoFlag(D-D) can neither associate with H2B nor transform to nanofibers through enzymatic reaction (Figure S6 and S9). These MitoFlag derivatives hardly inhibit mammalian cells (e.g. HeLa, HEK293, and HepG2) at 200 \uf06dM (Figure S11), regardless of their selfassembling at mitochondria. These results indicate that the association of MitoFLag(L-D) with H2B via NLS and the enzymeinstructed transformation into nanofibers are critical for MitoFLag(L-D) to traffic H2B to the mitochondria of HeLa cells (Scheme 1).

The results above indicate that MitoFlag(L-D) interacts with H2B-RFP, likely through the NLS domain, to traffic H2B to mitochondria (Scheme 1). MitoFlag(L-E) forms small nanoparticles or micelles at 200 ŒºM (Figure ), which become large aggregates upon doping NLSH2B (50 ŒºM, Figure ). The observations in TEM (Figure ) agree with the dissociation constants (Kd) of the binding between NLSH2B and MitoFlag(L-D), MitoFlag(L-E) and MitoFlag(D-D), which are 60.75, 107.94 and 184.81 ¬µM, respectively.

While the hydrolysis rates of MitoFlag(L-D) and MitoFlag(L-E) by ENTK are comparable (about 80% hydrolyzed in 48 h, Figure ) in cell free condition, adding NLSH2B hardly impedes the hydrolysis of MitoFlag(L-D) (Figure ), as evidenced by a large amount of parallel aligned nanofibers (7¬±1 nm, made of Napffk(G)y) (Figure ) formed after adding ENTK. On the contrary, NLSH2B substantially inhibits the enzymatic hydrolysis of MitoFlag(L-E) catalyzed by ENTK (Figure ), as supported by the formation of only sporadic nanofibers (9¬±1 nm) in the case of MitoFlag(L-E).

The use of the highly acoustically attenuating EPDM gasket between the two halves of the electrolyser allowed for the acoustic effects from each of the electrodes to be effectively isolated from one another. However, the crossover between electrodes was shown to be minimal.Constant current steps (60 s) of increasingly high areal current density were conducted with 120 s rests between each value. The acoustic emission was monitored across the course of the experiment. The results in Figure indicated that every time an acoustic event (a 'hit') was detected, it was above the chosen threshold value of 25 dB. The amplitude of each hit is indicated in each plot.For the cathode (Figure (a)) very few acoustic hits were observed at low current densities (e.g. Only two hits were observed across the 1 min, 10 mA cm -2 period), this is an indication of exceptionally low bubble formation with very limited acoustic activity. This trend for low amounts of bubble formation at low areal current densities continued across the first few current densities tested, although notably as the current density increased there was an increase in the number of hits occurring in each constant current step. After approximately 1500 s the number of acoustic hits increased more significantly. It is also observed"", ""ConclusionsIn this work, we have detected and analyzed the incidence of gas bubble formation during operation, of the cathode and anode of a high-performing capillary-fed water electrolysis cell.A voltage fluctuation and an acoustic emission technique were adapted and applied in combination, while applying current densities of up to 1 A cm -2 to the cell. Very similar resultswere obtained for the two techniques, with little bubble formation observed up to 0.17-0.20 A cm -2 . At higher current densities, up to around 0.6 A cm -2 , bubbles were formed predominantly at the cathode. Given that commercial alkaline electrolysers typically operate at current densities up to 0.6 A cm -2 , this suggests that minimizing bubble formation at the cathode offers the key opportunity for further performance improvements in the capillary-fed cell. The cathode and anode produced bubbles at similar rates at still higher current densities, to 1 A cm-2. Even at 1 A cm -2 , the rate of bubble formation on the electrodes was substantially lower than in conventional, 'bubbled' electrolysis cells.

Even the most efficient OER electrocatalysts to date show significant overpotentials (up to 0.4 V), which leads to a significant amount of energy being spent on producing oxygen, a product with low market value. As a result, the deployment of the green hydrogen production market is hindered: green hydrogen currently accounts for only 4% of the overall production worldwide, equivalent to 3.8 Mt in 2021. Interestingly, this is in line with the amount of electricity produced worldwide using solar PV, accounting for 3.6% (179 TWh in 2021). Therefore, boosting the largescale production of green hydrogen requires the parallel optimization and scale-up of both solar PV and electrolyzers.

Therefore, the selected discount rate is an important parameter in shaping strategies for decarbonizing and decentralizing ammonia production. On that account, it is essential for governments and entities to provide funding programs for building renewable ammonia production infrastructure. These funding opportunities, having lower discount rates, would allow for lower ammonia costs, distribution distances, and a more decentralized and resilient production and distribution network for wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production systems.

As the energy efficiency of a technology increases, the capacity for the system to operate in a decentralized manner increases. For example, low-efficiency 'Black Box' systems have an optimal production network with 124 regional production locations with a low capital cost scenario to 32 regional production locations with a high capital cost scenario. In this case, the average production cost for an optimized production and distribution network is between 1,000 USD/t N H 3 with a low capital cost scenario and 1,800 USD/t N H 3 with a high capital cost scenario (Figure ), the average transportation cost is between 90 USD/t N H 3 with a low capital cost scenario and 230 USD/t N H 3 with a high capital cost scenario (Figure ), and average transportation distance is between 1,000 km with a low capital cost scenario and 2,500 km with a high capital cost scenario (Figure ). A technology that may operate under these conditions is a nitrogen electrolysis cell. Considering the low performance and non-ideal centralized network, there are few gains from such a system.Medium-efficiency 'Black Box' systems have an optimal production network with 329 regional production locations with a low capital cost scenario to 92 regional production locations with a high capital cost scenario. This network size mirrors that of the Haber-Bosch process in terms of the degree of centralization.

Interestingly, all of the scenarios have the same trend between the number of production regions and the average distribution distance (Figure ). For all scenarios, the average ammonia distribution distance decreases from a maximum of 7,627 km for one production region to a minimum of 155 km for 6,000 production regions.A Pareto frontier highlights the tradeoff between production cost and distribution distance in optimal solutions (Figure ). The marginal change in the average ammonia production cost is inversely proportional to the average distribution distance. For instance, decreasing the average distribution distance by 50% from the most centralized scenario (one facility) results in a 5% increase in the average ammonia production costs.In contrast, decreasing the average distribution distance by 75% from the most centralized scenario (one facility) results in a 15% increase in the average ammonia production costs. Finally, decreasing the average distribution distance by 95% from the most centralized scenario (one facility) results in a 35% increase in the average ammonia production costs. These results highlight the tradeoff in decentralization and production cost, emphasizing the importance of selecting the number of regional production regions so that the production costs remain low while having low distribution distances that are resilient to changes in transportation costs.To understand the production cost and the response to changes in the transportation cost of different wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production networks, we performed a network optimization analysis for a centralized (100 production regions), partially decentralized (500 production regions), and fully decentralized scenario (3,000 production regions). Then we studied the behavior of each decentralization scenario', 'funding typically resulting in lower discount rates compared to private funding. Higher discount rates lead to higher ammonia costs, longer distribution distances, larger regional production capacities, and a lower number of production regions. Conversely, lower discount rates result in lower ammonia costs, shorter distribution distances, smaller regional production capacities, and a higher number of production regions. For instance, a low discount rate of 3% results in ammonia costs between 540 USD/t N H 3 and 950 USD/t N H 3 and distribution distances between 510 km and 1,020 km, while a high discount rate of 10% results in ammonia costs between 680 USD/t N H 3 and 1,230 USD/t N H 3 and distribution distances between 660 km and 1,400 km. To facilitate the transition towards renewable and decentralized ammonia production, it is crucial for governments and entities to offer funding programs with lower discount rates.We also address the complex interaction between the emerging wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production industry and existing water infrastructure. Our results show that it is possible to create wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production infrastructure to meet global fertilizer demand while maintaining competitive costs and low water stress. When prioritizing water over cost, it is possible to reduce the average water stress by 99% with only a 1.4% increase in ammonia costs.Our results highlight the benefits of a decarbonized and decentralized ammonia supply chain by showing that the decentralization of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production leads to reduced levels of price sensitivity. With the price of agricultural commodities rising rapidly, the current system of ammonia production places unnecessary strain on global food security due to its susceptibility to volatility in energy prices.

While 92 to 329 facilities are still centralized, the ability to distribute these facilities across the globe, rather than clustering the facil-ities, reduces the distance between manufacturing locations and farms by nearly three times when compared to current Haber-Bosch facilities, which has a minimum distance between Haber-Bosch locations and farms of 1,250 km. This would aid in increasing access, and would potentially reduce safety issues. An emerging technology that may be able to operate at these energy efficiencies is lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction.

"Wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia and distribution uncertaintyWith increasingly uncertain oil prices and global distribution systems, the ammonia production infrastructure must be insensitive to changes in ammonia transportation costs. 52 The need for a more robust chemical supply chain has become evident with the increase in distribution costs and supply chain issues in the last two years. A decentralized production infrastructure results in shorter transportation distances and therefore lower distribution costs. Furthermore, decentralized production could lead to improved resiliency to the failure of production nodes.An analysis of six energy efficiency scenarios evaluates the correlation between decentralization level and ammonia production cost and distribution distance (Figure ).This analysis covers production and distribution networks between one and 6,000 global regional production locations.

For the partially decentralized scenario, the same change in transport cost results in a 90 USD/t N H 3 increase in the cost of ammonia.

We combine this with a multi-objective optimization to determine the optimal wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production locations to match the global fertilizer demand from agriculture. We focus on meeting the demand for agricultural fertilizers while minimizing production costs, distribution costs, and water stress at the production sites.We highlight the potential of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production as a renewable and decentralized alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. We show that to match the highest market price in the last 5 years (‚àº 1,600 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 25% and capital costs below 900 USD/kW, energy efficiencies above 20% and capital costs below 550 USD/kW, or energy efficiencies above 15% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW. If the price of the ammonia market recovers to the lowest market price in the last 5 years, the technologies must achieve energy efficiency greater than 70% and capital costs lower than 200 USD/kW. With the increasing uncertainty of natural gas prices, wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production could become an economical alternative that could decouple natural gas from ammonia production.Additionally, we address the importance of discount rates on the ammonia production cost, distribution distance, and optimal decentralization level. The chosen discount rate is influenced by factors such as inflation, risk, and funding sources, with government funding typically resulting in lower discount rates compared to private funding. Higher discount', ""and economic parameter has on the ammonia production cost and on the optimal locations of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production regions for a 'Black Box' system.

Improving the system's energy efficiency from 40% to 60% leads to a 28% reduction in the average ammonia costs, whereas a decrease in energy efficiency from 40% to 20% results in an 80% increase in average ammonia costs. Variations in the electrolyzer capital cost introduce a 16% deviation in the average ammonia costs from the reference scenario. Similarly, an increase in the wind capital cost corresponds to a 9% increase in ammonia costs, while a reduction in the wind capital cost yields a 14% decrease in ammonia costs. Furthermore, variations in the discount rate also play a significant role, with a high discount rate causing a 11% increase and a low discount rate resulting in a 14% decrease in the average ammonia cost compared to the reference scenario.Similarly, the optimal locations for production regions are significantly impacted by the system's energy efficiency, electrolyzer economic parameters, wind economic parameters, and"", 'scenario (3,000 production regions). Then we studied the behavior of each decentralization scenario with respect to changes in transportation costs for each decentralization scenario and energy efficiency scenario (Figure ). The centralized scenario (100 production regions) resembles the current ammonia production infrastructure through the Haber-Bosch process (Figure ). In contrast, the proposed centralized scenario for wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production shifts production from areas with developed and inexpensive natural gas resources to areas with good wind and solar resources (Figure ).Consequently, with the implementation of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia, a bulk of the production capacity migrates to the global south, which historically has produced low quantities of ammonia.A partially decentralized scenario (500 production regions) results in production facilities located closer to agricultural centers (Figure ). The average distance between the production facilities and the agricultural centers decreases from 990 km in the centralized scenario to 510 km. This scenario still places great importance on production cost over distribution distance. Finally, a fully decentralized scenario results in smaller', 'cost scenario (Figure ) -which is up to three times lower than the minimum distance between Haber-Bosch locations and farms. Thus, high-efficiency wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production systems are an essential requirement for the decentralized chemical manufacturing of fertilizers.To achieve an ammonia cost (production + distribution) under the highest market price in the last 5 years (‚àº 1,600 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 25% and capital costs below 900 USD/kW, energy efficiencies above 20% and capital costs below 550 USD/kW, or energy efficiencies above 15% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW (Figure ). In contrast, to achieve an ammonia cost (production + distribution) under the lowest market price in the last 5 years (‚àº 400 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 70% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW (Figure ). Note, however, that these prices do not take into consideration environmental externalities, geopolitics, and governmental-based subsidies.Therefore, improving the energy efficiency of state-of-the-art wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production systems over selectivity is the critical performance metric in order to achieve decentralized wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia. On that account, it might be prudent to focus policy and investments in research and development while the energy efficiencies remain low (EE < 40%), and then, transition policy-guided investments towards strategies to minimize ammonia costs through incentives, taxes, efficiency standards, and the scale-up of renewable ammonia production technologies.']","['Energy', 'Renewable energy sources']",2021,1,1,0,0.89541085,1.285443721,['why']
"Case study (2): HemocyaninsOur second illustrative case focuses on copper-binding proteins. From hemocyanin to blue copper protein, Nature has intensively adapted its toolbox to incorporate this metal. Interestingly, copper is a very selective transition metal in terms of amino acids to which it could bind. Statistics (Table ) show that copper highly prefers histidine (70.8%). Other amino acids like cysteines (16.3%) or methionines (5.6%) are found with far lower frequencies. Glutamates (3.5%), as well as aspartates (2.3%), end the list of main coordinating amino acids to copper. One could therefore hypothesize that a way to detect copper-binding sites consists in identifying those histidine residues that are well pre-organized for metal binding. We performed BioMetAll runs on a series of hemocyanin proteins -a prototypical family of di-copper binding oxygen carriers-that coordinate copper throughout motifs of three histidine amino acids. After removal of the metal ions from the .pdb files, a set of experimentally characterized structures were screened to look for sites with a minimum of three histidine residues able to coordinate a metal ion. The search led to a 100% prediction for the di-copper binding sites for all the hemocyanins analyzed at the exact location of the X-ray structure (Table ). One example is given in Figure with Manduca sexta prophenoloxidase, a heterodimer consisting of two homologous polypeptide chains. One of the advantages of BioMetAll is to provide the user to control the specificities of the metal-binding search pattern. Even those that are not the ""best-case scenario"" can be evaluated based, for example, on chemical hypothesis.

In a subsequent study, we preselected docking areas by filtering the distance from the metal to the Œ≤-carbon of the amino acids Asp, His, Glu and Cys, using a range from 2.5 to 5.0 √Ö. Both works showed that few geometric descriptors related to the backbone of the protein afford with convenient information to predict metalbinding sites rather than focusing only on the first coordination sphere donors (mainly side chains) that coordinate the metal.BioMetAll represents a major step forward in how to predict metal-binding sites in proteins. The approach stands on the geometric information extracted from a collection of about 171000 biological complexes to infer a combination of geometric rules that are used to evaluate the regions of a protein for metal binding. The program accurately reproduces the experimental metal-binding motifs on a benchmark of 53 structures. Furthermore, we present three specific case studies to illustrate its potential. BioMetAll is efficient to i) predict metal-binding sites with particular amino acid motifs even for non-canonical metal coordinating amino acids and backbone atoms; ii) determine transient metal-binding sites in structures that need conformational changes to reach the complete coordination sphere, which could be related to metal diffusion pathways; and even iii) predict potential mutations of an existing protein to generate convenient metal-binding sites. This new approach can make a significant contribution to future development in fields like metalloenzyme and metallodrug design.', 'acids namely Asp, His, Glu and Cys while a 10.9% belongs to non-canonical amino acids (Asn, Thr, Ser, Gln, Met, Tyr, Lys and Arg). Only the last small fraction (<0.1%) are coordinations with a carboxylate terminal amino acid (Table ). Finally, most common metal-binding sites account with three coordinating amino acids on average (with an interquartile range of 2). On those grounds, BioMetAll works with default parameters that involved canonical amino acids side chains with a number of amino acids per metal-binding sites of three. The user can configure any other possible situation in a user-friendly manner.It is to notice that, besides standard amino acids, exogenous ligands (e.g. water or small molecules) can participate in the coordination of the metal. Although metrics for BioMetAll parameters have been obtained purely on amino acid geometric magnitudes, exogenous ligands could participate in the coordination of the metal on the analyzed set. The calculations we performed so far show that BioMetAll implicitly takes into account the changes in the metal position that those exogenous ligands could cause (as showed latter in the manuscript).', 'of the protein side chain for the metal to bind including transient geometries that require conformational changes or modification of the coordination environment (vacant sites, presence of labile ligands etc‚Ä¶) for the metal to bind.In recent years, our group has actively worked in areas where it was essential to predict with confidence those amino acids that could coordinate metal compounds either for proteins or peptides. In those works, we frequently confront with new-to-Nature metal-binding sites, X-ray structures of proteins without a well-defined binding site or even putative binding sites of metallodrugs. Part of our efforts allowed us to develop a series of docking approaches that can well reproduce low energy poses of metal-protein complexes. However, such approaches are only viable if good guesses for metal-binding regions are accessible on the first hand. For this aspect, in a first statistical analysis about ten years ago, we observed that i) any amino acid with its ‚ç∫-carbon located within a sphere up to 7-9 √Ö could potentially be considered as a metal ligand (obviously considering possible coordination by residues with long side chains like lysine or tyrosine) and ii) the center of mass of the coordinating residues generally does not stand far from the exact position of the metal ions observed in the', 'of mutations. This run of BioMetAll looking for possible sites allowing a mutation to either Asp or Glu provided with an extensive list of possible solutions including Asn131 (Table ). The following step was a post-process by filtering the solutions that show collapse between the probes and any amino acid side chain or backbone from close neighbors of the putative metal-binding areas. This filtering process together with a visual inspection diminished the number of possibilities to five candidates (Table and Figure ).To further assess the predictiveness of BioMetAll under a metalloenzyme design framework, the predicted systems were used as a starting point for docking experiments. Calculations were carried out with the protein-ligand docking software GOLD software and repeated inside our GaudiMM platform (to provide with a freeware alternative). Both calculations were performed The predictiveness of BioMetAll is excellent and compares very well with other algorithms when it comes to determine metal-binding sites as well as the exact list of the amino acids involved in the coordination motifs. Those predictions are of good quality even when exogenous compounds are involved. BioMetAll tests on several key systems show that i) it efficiently predicts primary as well as secondary metal-binding sites, ii) it can easily account on how the conformational changes of the protein could alter the formation of metal-binding sites, iii) it allows to work with common metal-binding templates as well as non-standard ones, iv) it identifies sites even with incomplete coordination spheres, and v) it allows to predict mutations that could be necessary to generate new metal-binding sites in a protein', 'mind, we performed a second series of calculations releasing the restraint of the search motif from three histidine residues to only two with eventually a third amino acids being cysteine, methionine, aspartate or glutamate. The results provide with several putative metal-binding sites spreading to a broader part of the protein but, to our surprise, those were not randomly scattered inside the scaffold (example for Manduca sexta prophenoloxidase shown in Figure ). Instead, a continuum pattern of adjacent sites that evolves from solventexposed locations to the buried di-copper site was observed. This observation, combined with the presence of water molecules along those channels in several crystal structures, strongly suggest the possibility that BioMetall allowed the detection of metal diffusion pathways. It is interesting to comment that our intents to use traditional approaches for channeling predictions, like those based on calculating solvent excluded surface calculations, did not lead to such clear prediction of metal compatible pathways neither a map of histidine onto the crystallographic structure would provide with such information (although being obviously related). Although falling far for the main objectives of this work, such observation could be particularly interesting to investigate the properties of metal diffusion in hemocyanins and their relationship to oligomeric states. The versatility of BioMetAll could lead to interesting outcoming when looking for diffusion pathways of metallic species in proteins.']","['Metal organic frameworks', 'Catalytic applications']",1479,1,1,0,0.790030444,-2.22E-16,['why']

Brown marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy -via administration of the recombinant enzyme (i.e. alpha Velmanase, Lamzede¬Æ) <ref', 'helix) and a change in the orientation of the side chain of Q444, residue located close to one of the Zn 2+ -coordinating residues, H445 (Figure ). We further analyzed the interactions of the other 48 detected positions with the surrounding residues (second sphere, Figure ). As outcome, we found out that up to 14 of these 48 positions have a direct interaction with known positions where missense mutations are reported. As example, the residue identified in these studies, F337, forms a backbone-backbone hydrogen bond with H200, a œÄ-cation interaction with Lys373, and interestingly, an edge œÄ-cation interaction with the side chain of R229 (Figure ). The former position is listed within the reported missense mutations. Thus, we ran MD simulations of the R229W variant as we did for the wild-type enzyme in order to analyze its molecular interactions. The side chain of R229 has as main interactions two hydrogen bonds with the backbone of E234 and the side chain of Q237, respectively, and a salt-bridge with the D225 carboxylate. In the R229W variant, all these three interactions are lost. Finally, we measured the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the surface accessible solvent area (SASA) in hLAMAN since it has been proposed that the impact of some specific mutations could alter it. Thus, we monitored the degree of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components on SASA along 1.5-\uf06ds MD simulation trajectories for the wild-type, D74E, and R229W systems. In the latter case, the loss of key interactions, as described above, could bring about a reconfiguration of the exposed surface of the protein. In Figure we represent both hydrophobic and hydrophilic SASA populations using violin plots. No significant differences were found between the three systems. The variant R229W', 'violin plots. No significant differences were found between the three systems. The variant R229W shows a slightly larger hydrophobic SASA component (+1 nm 2 ) and lower hydrophilic SASA (-0.4 nm 2 ) when compared with the wild-type enzyme (Table ), but no major conformational changes were detected in the two mutated systems (Figures and). Thus, our computational data confirm that the mutation R229W does not change the hydrophilic patterning of the surface or the total conformation of the protein, but rather modifies the network of interactions of the active site with its first sphere environment (F377).On the one hand, we have found that the Zn 2+ -dependent hLAMAN follows an E5 \uf0ae 4 H5/ 1 S5 \uf0ae 1 S5 conformational itinerary, similar to the one observed in the Ca 2+ -dependent GH92 Œ±-mannosidase. On the other hand, overall, in this work we have used different computational approaches to understand at the atomic level the impact that several mutations have on the biological role of hLAMAN. We have shed light on the molecular basis of the pathophysiology of 4 missense mutations in LAMAN. D74E shows a larger energy barrier, D159N and E402K may affect the conformation at the active site, and R229Wdoes not impact the SASA distribution in hLAMAN and its effect should be connected with the chemical dynamics of the active site. Overall, our findings open up new avenues for targeting hLAMAN with new tools that can be used for the screening of small organic molecules with the aim of modulating its enzyme activity. Further studies are ongoing within our research group.Figure 1 .1Figure 1. (A) Example of targeted oligosaccharides by hLAMAN at the lysosome.

Prompted by our findings, we were committed to understand the effect of some of the missense mutations with significant impact on hLAMAN activity. This is the case of the D74E variant, where one extra methylene group is inserted into the side chain of this Zn 2+ -coordination sphere residue. First, we found out that the puckering of the reactive ring in BMA shows a different conformational energy profile than when bound to the wild-type counterpart (Figure vs Figure ). Now, the E5 conformation is energetically unfavorable towards a B2,5 conformation. We simulated the reaction mechanism for the same substrate BMA. We obtained a DFTB3 energy barrier of 12.3 kcal mol -1 , 5.1 kcal mol -1 (+75 %) larger than for the wild-type (Figure ). The height of the barrier increases up to a value of 37.3 kcal mol -1 via the NEB method (GFN2-xTB/ff19SB, Table vs. Table ).

Although not experimentally measurable, these quantities reflect the bonding patterns imprinted in the electronic structure and related to the structural, spectroscopic, and thermochemical observables. The definition of the effective number of unpaired electrons is grounded in the concept of natural orbitals . Natural orbitals are the eigenstates of the one-particle reduced density matrix, with the eigenvalues n i that are non-negative, less than 2, and add up to the total number of electrons; hence, they can be interpreted as orbital occupations. That is, natural orbitals with occupations close to 2 can be described as doubly occupied orbitals, those with small occupation numbers can be described as unoccupied orbitals, and orbitals with noticeable fractional occupations can be described as natural frontier orbitals.

As the ground state in Li 2 is of gerade symmetry, all g states are dark and u states are bright. The effective number of entangled states Z HE in these four lowest-energy transitions is 4.0 due to spin-and space-entanglement of electronic excitation, as compared to Z HE = 1.0 in an isolated Li atom and Z HE ‚âà 2.0 in Li 2 around the equilibrium geometry. In addition to the singly excited states of covalent character, there are also higher-lying doubly excited states of covalent character, as well as the manifold of the singly and doubly excited ionic states.In a hypermetallic molecule of the ACCA type, one of the two valence electrons of each alkaline earth metals is transferred to the linker, giving rise to strongly ionic AC bonds and two unpaired electrons, each localized at the respective metal center, making ACCA analogous to the two alkali metals separated by a large distance. Below we examine the electronic structure of ACCH and ACCA with varied metal (A = Mg, Ca, Sr) and compare with electronic structure of Li 2 .Considering electronic structure of ACCH, in the ground X 2 Œ£ + state the unpaired electron is localized at the metal occupying the hybridized sœÉ-pœÉ orbital (see a representative example of the Dyson orbitals of MgCCH in Figure ). Upon excitation to the higher 1 2 Œ† and 2 2 Œ£ + states, the electron remains localized at the metal and occupies the hybridized pœÄ-dœÄ and pœÉdœÉ orbitals, respectively. The orbital hybridization arises due to the presence of the negatively charged ligand and can be reproduced by perturbatively adding a point-charge potential to the Hamiltonian of a hydrogen-like atom .While the electron remains largely localized at the metal, the minor leakage to the ligand is always present, leading to slightly non-diagonal', ""occupied orbitals as can be concluded from the values of n u,nl that are close to 2.25 (Table   in SI.Switching to ACCBs, Figure shows two frontier natural orbitals and their occupations for the ground X 1 Œ£ + state of MgCCCa; natural orbitals of MgCCSr and CaCCSr are shown in Figure in SI. Similarly to ACCA, the antibonding natural orbital has a higher occupation number than the bonding orbital reflecting a considerable role of through-bond interactions.The occupation numbers in all three ACCBs across all covalent states are either close or match exactly those of a perfectly diradical wavefunction and, correspondingly, the Head-Gordon's indices approach their limiting values of 2 (Table in SI). In particular, in the ground state n u,nl is in the range of 1.96-1.99 suggesting that the interaction between two electrons is weak but non-negligible. Accordingly, singlet-triplet gap varies in the range of 0.008-0.002 eV depending on the particular combination of alkaline earth metals.In contrast to the ground state, in the 1 1 Œ† state, n u,nl = 2.00 in all three molecules suggesting a pure diradical character of the wavefunction. This is further supported by the natural orbitals analysis. Natural orbitals of MgCCCa displayed in Figure show that in the 1 1 Œ† state, the electron on Mg side is in its local ground Œ£ + state, whereas the second electron is in the locally excited Œ† state. Specifically, the occupation number of both natural orbitals is 0.99 and the visual appearance of the natural orbitals is similar to the Dyson orbitals of the corresponding states in MgCCH and CaCCH.As the transition to the 1 1 Œ† state in MgCCCa is localized on Ca, the excitation energy and oscillator strength are close to those associated with the transition to the"", 'type=""bibr"" target=""#b53"">54 .Finally, as in the case of Li 2 , we consider natural orbitals as a tool to interpret the electronic structures of ACCAs. Figure shows two frontier natural orbitals and their occupations for the ground X 1 Œ£ + g state of MgCCMg; natural orbitals of CaCCCa and SrCCSr are shown in Figure in the SI. In all three molecules, the antibonding natural orbital has a higher occupation number than the bonding orbital in contrast to the case of Li 2 , where, in the agreement with the molecular orbital theory, the bonding natural orbital lies below the antibonding orbital. Such an effect of the flipped orbital ordering has been observed in systems where the (indirect) through-bond interaction between electrons dominates a weak (direct) through-space interaction; for example, it is clearly seen in para-benzyne . Indeed, orbital hybridization induced by the negatively charged linker directs the distribution of the two electrons away from each other, thus minimizing the orbital overlap and through-space interaction.The occupation numbers in all three ACCAs are very close to those of a perfectly diradical wavefunction (i.e., n 1 = n 2 = 1) and, correspondingly, the Head-Gordon\'s indices are close to the limiting value of 2 (Table in SI). The observed small deviations from the perfect diradical values reflect that the interaction between two unpaired electrons is weak but is not negligible. As such, the electronic wavefunction of the X 1 Œ£ + g state in all three ACCA molecules is dominated by the covalent configuration with a small contribution from the ionic (chargeresonance) configuration. In contrast, the X 3 Œ£ + u state is, as expected, of a pure covalent character with the n u,nl = 2.00. The singlet-triplet energy gaps do not exceed 0.02', 'are several ways that can be used to compute an effective number of unpaired electrons from natural occupation numbers and here we rely on the indices introduced by Head-Gordon 56 ; specifically, n u,nln u,nl = i n 2 i (2 -n i ) 2 ,(2)which has been shown to reliably yield values that are consistent with chemical intuition.To visualize the states of the unpaired electrons we use Dyson orbitals and natural orbitals .

The computational details are described in the SI.Before proceeding to discuss the electronic structure of homosymmetric ACCA molecules, we first examine a simpler case of two weakly interacting Li atoms, sufficiently far apart such that the underlying wavefunction exhibits strong diradical character.

The weak through-space interaction in Li 2 splits the atomic 2 P state into four states: the pair of 1 Œ£ + u and 1 Œ£ + g states separated by 0.16 eV and the pair of 1 Œ† g and 1 Œ† u states separated by 0.09 eV. The difference in splitting in the two pairs of states is consistent with the different orbital overlap between the p-orbitals oriented parallel or perpendicular to the Li-Li axis. Figure shows frontier natural orbitals and their occupations in the 1 Œ£ + g and 1 Œ† g states as two representative examples.

UCC framework is Hermitian, provides an upper bound for the energy, and is size extensive by construction.However, the price paid for the variational bound is that the originally proposed qEOM ansatz does not satisfy the killer condition that ensures the ground-state cannot be de-excited. Mukherjee and co-workers proposed a unitary transformation of the EOM projection operators to address the killer condition issue of the UCC theory . Asthana et al. have implemented this technique on quantum devices. The algorithm, named EOM-VQE , yields more accurate excitation energies (EEs), ionization potentials (IPs), and electron affinities (EAs) than originally proposed qEOM .The qEOM procedure leverages classical and quantum computing resources. Specifically, the Hamiltonian matrix is measured on a quantum computer within a given many-electron basis, and the resulting matrix is subsequently diagonalized on a classical computer. Although the measurement processes of the Hamiltonian can potentially benefit from quantum architecture, for the entire calculation to be effective, one also needs a cost-efficient algorithm for the diagonalization step done on a classical computer.

The UCC formalism is Hermitian, variational, and size-extensive, however, unlike H, the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series of H does not terminate naturally making it unfeasible for classical computers.

Because the CC equations are derived by projection technique, E CC is not a variational bound to the exact ground-state energy and can diverge in the strongly correlated regime, when the single Slater determinant is not a good approximation to the exact ground state.Variational formulation of the CC theory solves this problem , but is impractical on classical computers because the resulting equations do not truncate.

We show that by tuning the reaction conditions both during the film growth and during the film annealing, highly uniform, crystalline, and electrically conductive Cu-HHTP films could be produced to fabricate a sensing device in reduced processing times. We then use the 2D MOF films to sense PFOA and PFOS in water by fabricating two-terminal chemiresistive sensors. We show', 'change even after 10 cycles, likely due to abundant binding sites at the film interface. This excellent sensitivity towards PFAS in MOF-based devices contrasted with a control device where a bare channel used and immersed in contaminated water similarly to the MOF-based sensor. The bare channel shows an increase in resistance when PFOA was introduced in PBS (Fig. ) as expected after introducing non-conductive analytes. Given the sensitivity of impedance spectroscopy towards electrolyte compositional changes, the observed decrease in our MOF film resistance while the electrolyte resistance increases proves that the material is indeed sensing the analyte. Such working mechanism using Cu-HHTP allows us to efficiently detect oxidative agents (in this case PFAS) especially in water using a robust and affordable setup.The MOF-based sensors we demonstrate are easy to fabricate, scalable, and offer readouts in minutes as opposed to other techniques such as mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, time-of-flight mass spectrometry) which involve long sample preparation and data acquisition times. In fact, our sensors show to be extremely sensitive (with a detection limit as low as 0.002 ng/L) towards the two most common PFAS (PFOA and PFOS) proving to detect these compounds well below their health advisory levels (HALs) recommended by the US environmental protection agency (EPA) and the food and drug administration (FDA). In drinking water, the HALs for these two acids have been set to as low as 10 ng/L. The MOF-based sensor could detect both PFOA and PFOS at concentrations nearly 4 orders of magnitude below these suggested levels (Fig. ), and more than 2 orders of magnitude better than the best reported sensitivity levels by sensors']","['Metal organic frameworks', 'Sensing and detection']",3046,1,1,0,0.916905434,2.22E-16,['why']

The electrode treated with the chronoamperometry additionally displays intense Bragg\'s reflections characteristic of metallic Bi (space group R-3m) as well as traces of metallic Cu phase (space group Fm-3m), both as a result of cathodic photocorrosion.

CuBi2O4 undergoes photocorrosion to Bi and Cu, and further dissolves releasing Cu ions in the electrolyte and forming BiPO4. The rapid formation of Bi correlates with an abrupt drop of photocurrents.ABSTRACT. CuBi2O4 has recently emerged as a promising photocathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, its fast degradation under operation currently poses a limit to its application. Here, we report a novel method to study operando the semiconductor-electrolyte interface during PEC operation by surface-sensitive high-energy Xray scattering. We find that a fast decrease in the generated photocurrents correlates directly with the formation of a metallic Bi phase. We further show that the slower formation of metallic Cu, as well as the dissolution of the electrode in contact with the electrolyte, further affect the CuBi2O4 activity and morphology. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the degradation mechanisms affecting CuBi2O4 electrodes under operation and poses the methodological basis to investigate the photocorrosion processes affecting a wide range of PEC materials.', 'SummaryIn this work, we show an operando high-energy X-ray scattering method to investigate the photocorrosion mechanisms and relative time scales on photo-electrochemically active CuBi2O4 electrodes. We measure TS and SAXS simultaneously in grazing incidence to reveal structural modification close to the CuBi2O4-electrolyte interface. We show that under illumination and applied bias the CuBi2O4 electrodes quickly undergo a cathodic photocorrosion process which determines the formation of a segregating metallic Bi phase. This process takes place on a time scale of only few minutes after beginning of the chronoamperometry and correlates with a decrease of around one order of magnitude in the observed photocurrents. Moreover, additional degradation processes occur on slower time scales: formation of metallic Cu and dissolution in the electrolyte as an effect of both anionic photocorrosion and acidic dissolution. The two phenomena cause a steady release of Cu 2+ ions in solution as well as the crystallization of BiPO4 branched structures at the surface of the electrode due to the interaction of the releasing Bi 3+ ions with the phosphate species in the electrolyte. The formation of an insulating BiPO4 layer is likely responsible for the slow decrease in the measured photocurrents at intermediate and later stages of the chronoamperometry.In summary, our study shows that the high-energy X-ray scattering can probe structural information ranging from atomic to nanometer length scales in a realistic experimental environment, thus allowing to simultaneously correlate chemical and morphological modification of the film electrode with changes of photocurrent.

For values of Œ±i below a critical angle Œ±c, the penetration depth of the evanescent X-rays in the film is low and the scattering signal originates only from the topmost layer of the photoactive material (Figure ). For Œ±i > Œ±c the X-ray penetration depth in the sample quickly increases, as indicated by the occurrence of diffraction peaks from the FTO substrate.

The agreement worsens significantly for the polyatomic CH 2 PCl: CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ results are within 25% of the experiment, while upon application of second-order vibrational perturbation theory, or single-hybrid DFAs, the deviation from experiment increases.

The bond lengths of Morino and Matsumura 1are used for all r 0 and r SE e structures.Unlike in the previous work, the initial fit reported here takes into account all available isotopologue data. This structure is used as the r SE e in the following text.

Such experimental binding energies are generally valid under two assumptions: i) the center-of-mass axis of the monomers is approximately parallel with the a axis of inertia, and ii) the centrifugal distortion is mainly due to a single vibrational mode along the center-of-mass axis. While the latter is true for all of the studied complexes, the former approximation is only valid from Ar‚Ä¢‚Ä¢OCS down the group.The agreement between the experimental estimates and the calculated D E data is remarkably good for the rare gas complexes (within ""chemical accuracy"" of 0.4 kJ/mol), given how na√Øve such a fit to a Lennard-Jones model is.

The results are shown in Table in the Supporting information. The binding energies obtained using the supermolecular approach (ie. from E complex -E monomers ) should be identical to the Lennard-Jones model when B2PLYP-derived data is used in both.

The calculated MP2+Œ¥(T) binding energies D E are in a good agreement with the experimental values using the Lennard-Jones model for complexes up to Kr. This agreement breaks down with in heavier complexes likely due to relativistic effects. The minor disagreement in the interaction energies compared to previous CCSD(T) literature data can be explained by basis set incompleteness in the literature results. The deformation of the OCS monomer from its equilibrium structure upon complexation is predicted to be minimal, with the largest bend of 0.3 ‚Ä¢ predicted for Hg‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢OCS. The mass-dependent r (2) m structures of the Xe and Ne complexes differ significantly from the r SE e structures. The bond lengths and angles in the OCS monomer are distorted in the r ([1,2]) m fits, especially the position of the O-atom. However, with the OCS monomer constrained to its equilibrium geometry, the mass-dependent structures are likely the most accurate structures ever obtained for the two complexes. The 43 m√Ö difference in the monomer separation in the MP2+Œ¥(T) and r (2) m structures can be partially explained by the lack of diffuse functions in the cc-pwcVnZ basis sets: upon augmentation the difference drops to 15 m√Ö. The closest agreement with the r (2) m structure could be obtained by adding the 4-th order relativistic correction (+Œ¥ 4 rel ) to the MP2+Œ¥(T) results, highlighting the importance of relativistic effects.

"stress and prioritizing cost when building the future wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia infrastructure could lead to further stress in regions where water scarcity is already an issue.In contrast, a scenario that prioritizes water over cost (Figure -blue line) results in an increase in the average ammonia production cost to 822 USD/t N H 3 , a decrease in the distribution cost to 82 USD/t N H 3 , and a decrease in the water stress to 8% (indicating that the water usage is 8% of the total available water). Therefore, placing more importance on water stress results in a 1.4% increase in ammonia production and distribution cost and a 99% decrease in the average water stress. A Pareto frontier highlights the tradeoff between cost and water stress in optimal solutions (Figure ).

This is essential to prevent water consumption for ammonia production from competing with water consumption for public supply, irrigation, and power generation in already water-depleted regions. Our results can benefit regions with high levels of wind, solar irradiance, and water stress, such as the southwest of the United States, Sub-Saharan Africa, and regions of central and east Asia (Figure ).In the scenario prioritizing cost over water, the optimization model is insensitive to water stress and optimizes solely on the basis of cost.

We combine this with a multi-objective optimization to determine the optimal wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production locations to match the global fertilizer demand from agriculture. We focus on meeting the demand for agricultural fertilizers while minimizing production costs, distribution costs, and water stress at the production sites.We highlight the potential of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production as a renewable and decentralized alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. We show that to match the highest market price in the last 5 years (‚àº 1,600 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 25% and capital costs below 900 USD/kW, energy efficiencies above 20% and capital costs below 550 USD/kW, or energy efficiencies above 15% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW. If the price of the ammonia market recovers to the lowest market price in the last 5 years, the technologies must achieve energy efficiency greater than 70% and capital costs lower than 200 USD/kW. With the increasing uncertainty of natural gas prices, wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production could become an economical alternative that could decouple natural gas from ammonia production.Additionally, we address the importance of discount rates on the ammonia production cost, distribution distance, and optimal decentralization level. The chosen discount rate is influenced by factors such as inflation, risk, and funding sources, with government funding typically resulting in lower discount rates compared to private funding. Higher discount', 'funding typically resulting in lower discount rates compared to private funding. Higher discount rates lead to higher ammonia costs, longer distribution distances, larger regional production capacities, and a lower number of production regions. Conversely, lower discount rates result in lower ammonia costs, shorter distribution distances, smaller regional production capacities, and a higher number of production regions. For instance, a low discount rate of 3% results in ammonia costs between 540 USD/t N H 3 and 950 USD/t N H 3 and distribution distances between 510 km and 1,020 km, while a high discount rate of 10% results in ammonia costs between 680 USD/t N H 3 and 1,230 USD/t N H 3 and distribution distances between 660 km and 1,400 km. To facilitate the transition towards renewable and decentralized ammonia production, it is crucial for governments and entities to offer funding programs with lower discount rates.We also address the complex interaction between the emerging wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production industry and existing water infrastructure. Our results show that it is possible to create wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production infrastructure to meet global fertilizer demand while maintaining competitive costs and low water stress. When prioritizing water over cost, it is possible to reduce the average water stress by 99% with only a 1.4% increase in ammonia costs.Our results highlight the benefits of a decarbonized and decentralized ammonia supply chain by showing that the decentralization of wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production leads to reduced levels of price sensitivity. With the price of agricultural commodities rising rapidly, the current system of ammonia production places unnecessary strain on global food security due to its susceptibility to volatility in energy prices. The ammonia produced by the Haber-Bosch process is', 'Wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia and water uncertaintyA resource-related challenge to wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production is the need for clean water, as it requires a minimum of 1.6 metric tons of water for each metric ton of ammonia produced. We must consider the spatial distribution of water stress to create ammonia production infrastructure that is not affected by changes in seasonal water availability. To do this, we modified the optimization equation (equation S46) by adding a weight (w 1 ) to the ammonia production cost and a weight (w 2 ) to the water stress at the possible production locations. By changing the value of w 1 and w 2 , we can vary the relative importance placed on the ammonia cost and water stress.As the importance placed on water stress increases, the average water stress decreases dramatically (Figure ). The same increase in the importance placed on water stress leads to a marginal increase in ammonia production and distribution costs. For example, a scenario that prioritizes cost over water (Figure -red line) results in an average ammonia production cost of 805 USD/t N H 3 , a distribution cost of 85 USD/t N H 3 , and a water stress of 6.8 (indicating that the water usage in the region is 6.8 times larger than The production and distribution networks were optimized assuming an ammonia transportation cost of 0.09 USD/t N H 3 -km for the medium cost scenario and 40% energy efficiency.

Therefore, placing no importance on water stress and prioritizing cost when building the future wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven', 'cost scenario (Figure ) -which is up to three times lower than the minimum distance between Haber-Bosch locations and farms. Thus, high-efficiency wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production systems are an essential requirement for the decentralized chemical manufacturing of fertilizers.To achieve an ammonia cost (production + distribution) under the highest market price in the last 5 years (‚àº 1,600 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 25% and capital costs below 900 USD/kW, energy efficiencies above 20% and capital costs below 550 USD/kW, or energy efficiencies above 15% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW (Figure ). In contrast, to achieve an ammonia cost (production + distribution) under the lowest market price in the last 5 years (‚àº 400 USD/t N H 3 ), wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production technologies must achieve energy efficiencies above 70% and capital costs below 200 USD/kW (Figure ). Note, however, that these prices do not take into consideration environmental externalities, geopolitics, and governmental-based subsidies.Therefore, improving the energy efficiency of state-of-the-art wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia production systems over selectivity is the critical performance metric in order to achieve decentralized wind and photovoltaic electricity-driven ammonia. On that account, it might be prudent to focus policy and investments in research and development while the energy efficiencies remain low (EE < 40%), and then, transition policy-guided investments towards strategies to minimize ammonia costs through incentives, taxes, efficiency standards, and the scale-up of renewable ammonia production technologies.']","['Energy', 'Renewable energy sources']",2014,1,1,0,0.934204424,2.22E-16,['why']

This work focuses on the remaining component of the force field, namely the re-fitting of key torsional parameters that describe the backbone and sidechain dynamics of an amino acid. The methods and validation tests broadly follow the approaches employed in the development of OPLS-AA/M, the latest OPLS force field. Torsional parameters are fit by minimizing the differences between multiple QM and MM potential energy scans of dipeptide backbone and sidechain dihedral angles. Our overall goal is to test the extent to which bespoke non-bonded parameters may be combined with libraries of bonded parameters to produce a protein force field that is compatible with our QUBE small molecule force field for use in computer-aided drug design applications.The performance of the QUBE protein force field is tested through comparisons between experiment and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a set of twenty dipeptides, the glycine tripeptide and alanine pentapeptide, and a range of small folded proteins. This benchmark testset is similar to those used in the development of protein force fields such as AMBER ff15ipq, AMOEBA, CHARMM36 and OPLS-AA/M. As we shall show, the QUBE protein force field is competitive with standard transferable force fields for the dipeptide set and alanine', 'Fitting Dipeptide Torsional ParametersTorsional parameters were optimized by minimizing the error function shown in eq 5 using asteepest descent algorithm. MM potential energy surfaces were computed by scanning dihedral angles in 15 ‚Ä¢ increments using the BOSS software. The backbone torsional parameters for all dipeptides tested, excluding serine and threonine, were fit to the alanine and glycine scans previously described. The total error for the two scans was given by:Error Total = 0.928 √ó Error Ala + 0.072 √ó Error Gly (6)  with the prefactors corresponding to the relative frequency of each amino acid in the human proteome. Preliminary testing (Section S1.1) showed that a weighting function and regularization did not significantly improve the conformations sampled during the dipeptide MD simulations and so were not used (Œª = 0, W = 0).The remaining dipeptides, threonine and serine (both of which contain aliphatic hydroxyl groups in their sidechain), were assigned identical backbone parameters that were fit to reproduce the QM scans of serine. For these scans, regularization and weighting were shown to be necessary to produce dipeptide dynamics which were in agreement with experiment.An investigation of how the simulation error changes with regularization is given in Section S1.2. The harmonic restraint parameter was set to Œª = 0.05.The sidechain scans for all dipeptides followed the same fitting process as the alanine/glycine backbone with no weighting or regularization used. As atom-typing is not used for the non-bonded parameter assignment in the QUBE force field, each set of sidechain torsional parameters is also residue-specific. This differs from the approach used in OPLS-AA/M in which sidechain torsional parameters with the same set of atom types are generally assigned the same parameters.In a number of cases', 'the same set of atom types are generally assigned the same parameters.In a number of cases it was necessary to make manual changes to the fitting process.This was restricted to setting a number of torsion parameters to zero (that is, Œª = ‚àû) and reducing the number of scans used in the fitting process. In particular, the aspartic acid œà/œÜ distribution was improved by setting the œá 2 torsional parameters to zero. Additionally, using only the QM energy scan with the lowest minimum energy in the fitting process was shown to result in an improvement in the MD simulations of the dipeptides for the œá 1 torsional parameters of cysteine, methionine, serine and threonine. The need for manual input in the fitting process was also required for developing OPLS-AA/M and is likely due to the restrictive functional form of the torsional potential and the conformational dependence of the energy scans. The full set of manual changes involved is listed, along with the final torsional parameters, in Section S3.3.', 'Torsional Parameter FittingThe final backbone torsional parameters and associated errors in the recreation of the QM energy scans are given in Section S3.2 of the Supporting Information. For the alanine and glycine scans, the error for the QUBE force field evaluated using eq 5 is 1.25 kcal/mol compared to 0.93 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M, which is a reasonable level of agreement. For proline and serine, the errors remain comparable to OPLS-AA/M.For the sidechain torsional parameters (Section S3.3), the mean error in the recreation of the QM potential energy scans for the QUBE force field is 1.29 kcal/mol, compared to 1.12 kcal/mol for OPLS-AA/M. Particularly high errors occur for both the œá 1 and œá 2 glutamic acid scans, and the glutamine œá 2 scan. For glutamic acid, the error is also high for the OPLS-AA/M force field parameters, but the rotamer populations remained close to the experimental data, and this may be due to a problem with the functional form used in classical force fields. The OPLS-AA/M error in the potential energy scan for glutamine is roughly half that of the QUBE force field. However, as we will show, the accuracy of the glutamine dipeptide MD simulations is good, and so no further refinement was made to the sidechain torsional parameters in this work.Although a low error in the reproduction of the QM potential energy surface is clearly the desired result, this does not necessarily correspond to accurate non-bonded force field parameters. The degree to which torsional parameters can improve the fit between MM and QM scans depends not only on the accuracy of the non-bonded, and bond and angle, parameters, but also on the shape of the energy difference between the QM and MM scans.The functional form used in classical MM force fields is very restrictive.

XTherefore, we make the assumption that the derived parameters for dipeptides are transferable to proteins, and in Section 4 we test the limitations of this assumption by validating the force field against experimental peptide and protein dynamical observables.The torsional terms in a force field are a function of the dihedral angles (œÜ) in a molecule.Here, we use the same functional form as the OPLS force field:V tors = k V k 1 2 (1 + cos(œÜ k )) + V k 2 2 (1 -cos(2œÜ k )) + V k 3 2 (1 + cos(3œÜ k )) + V k 4 2 (1 -cos(4œÜ k )) (4)where the sum runs over all dihedrals (k) in the molecule and V k 1-4 are parameters to be fit.

When fitting torsional parameters, the main objective is to minimize the difference between MM and QM gas phase dihedral energy scans.

As described in detail elsewhere, this approach uses a three-dimensional permittivity function Œµ(r) to interpolate between the values Œµ = 1 within the atomistic region (described using quantum chemistry), and Œµ = 78 in the continuum region, representing bulk water. A solvent-accessible surface is used to define the boundary across which this interpolation occurs. A permittivity function for the air/water interface can be constructed in similar fashion, using the Gibbs dividing surface (GDS) to define the boundary between Œµ = 1 (air) and Œµ = 78 (water). A schematic of this setup is shown in Fig. .Crucially, the continuum boundary conditions used herein contain a ""nonequilibrium"" correction to the VIE, in which the change in polarization upon sudden (vertical) ionization of the solute is computed using the solvent\'s optical dielectric constant, Œµ ‚àû . For water, whose static dielectric constant (Œµ 0 = 78)', 'solute may or may not be different than what it is bulk aqueous solution. Whereas liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy may be surface-sensitive, our results strongly suggest that the observable that it measures is not surface-sensitive.This work also reports a new computational protocol for aqueous VIEs. The existing conventional wisdom is that a prohibitively large number of explicit water molecules is needed to obtain converged VIEs in aqueous solution, but with an appropriate choice of continuum boundary conditions we find that convergence is achieved with two solvation shells. VIEs reported here are within 0.2-0.3 eV of experimental values, even for polyvalent anions. This is comparable to the accuracy of the best existing periodic DFT calculations of the same quantities, but without the complexities posed by the periodic treatment when the number of electrons changes. The protocol reported here is also readily extensible to wave function-based quantum chemistry.Rapid convergence of the VIE in our cluster-continuum protocol suggests that this quantity is mostly sensitive to short-range solvation structure, with the continuum boundary conditions making a large but non-specific contribution at longer range.

For reasons of computational expedience, these convergence tests were performed not with PEqS but instead using a polarizable continuum model (PCM), as convergence properties are similar in both cases. Convergence to the experimental VIE of 9.4 eV 86 is obtained using nonequilibrium boundary conditions with approximately two solvation shells of explicit water molecules, corresponding N ‚âà 40 water molecules or a cluster radius R ‚âà 6.0 √Ö around the ion. Similar convergence has been observed in the case of e -(aq), which might be considered something of a worst-case scenario due to the delocalized nature of the ion. This is obviously much faster convergence as compared to the hundreds of water molecules suggested above, and indeed it is clear from Fig. that convergence is dramatically slower in the absence of dielectric boundary conditions. Using vacuum boundary conditions, the VIE of NO - 3 (H 2 O) N is 1.0 eV smaller than the experimental value even with N ‚âà 70 explicit water molecules. Boundary conditions based on an equilibrium continuum model (using Œµ 0 only) push that value closer to experiment, but the nonequilibrium (Œµ ‚àû -dependent) correction contributes 0.5 eV in this example and is necessary in order to obtain agreement with experiment.

This partitioning of the entropy into vibrational and conformational parts was first introduced by Karplus et al., and has since been used in many studies. A well-known problem of RRHO-based entropy calculations is that S vib tends to infinity for vibrational frequencies approaching zero. In actual calculations for larger, flexible molecules, many low-frequency vibrational modes appear which are often better characterized by internal rotations of functional groups rather than by stretching or bending vibrations. They are in a typical range of 5-50 cm -1 and can spoil the computed entropy due to artificial numerical errors and their strong anharmonicity components. Correction schemes exist which explicitly treat such modes anharmonically in a coupled or uncoupled form . These methods require the costly computation of one-dimensional (1D) PES as well as definition of special internal coordinates. In our opinion, while such methods can be beneficial and accurate for small to medium sized and not too flexible molecules (‚âà 20-30 atoms), they are not viable for a robust and rather general treatment for systems with hundreds of atoms.In 2012, one of us proposed to modify the treatment of the low-frequency part of the vibrational spectrum by taking a so-called rotor-approximation and continuously interpolating between a rigid-rotor and vibrational description for each mode.

Unfortunately, the many costly DFT geometry optimizations and frequency calculations will quickly become the computational bottleneck for moderately sized systems. Therefore, as a further approximation, we compute S msRRHO at the DFT level for the lowest conformer and add the respective ensemble contribution as a thermostatistical average over all populated conformers at a less computationally demanding, lower theoretical level. The arising S msRRHO term is given byS msRRHO = p i S msRRHO,i -S msRRHO,ref ,(11)where S msRRHO,i is the absolute msRRHO entropy of the conformer calculated at the low force-field or SQM level to avoid very many (high level/DFT) HO calculations.

S msRRHO,ref typically refers to the DFT reference structure, for which vibrational frequencies are calculated at the SQM or FF level. To avoid changes to the geometry and appearance of imaginary vibrational modes, we here additionally make use of a new procedure called Single Point Hessian (SPH), for which some details are given in the Supporting Information, but will be published elsewhere.

A special run type was implemented for this purpose, where the focus is set to an extensive sampling around the global and low-lying local minima.Ideally the calculation of S conf should be conducted from the already known global minimum conformer, e.g., obtained from another conformational search with default settings in CREST. The enantiomer degenaracy number g i is obtained automatically as described in detail the Supporting Information. For the msRRHO part, any quantum chemical method or even force-fields can be applied.

However, because step three is usually the computational bottleneck, it is recommended to take S msRRHO from a more accurate DFT treatment. In general, this partitioning allows systematic improvements of the scheme because the different contributions can in principle be calculated at any level of theory.If no low-lying conformers (relative energy <1-2 kcal/mol at ambient temperature) are found in the first step, the entropy run is not necessary and the plain S msRRHO value can be taken.

In this case for molecules with non-degenerate electronic ground states, all g i are unity. Rotamers are structures indistinguishable by any nuclear spin-independent quantum mechanical observable. They arise from rotation around covalent chemical bonds (or other inversion-type processes) that interchange nuclei belonging to the same group of nuclides, as for example the interchange of protons at a methyl group by rotation.In this work, we propose and implement for the first time an automatic algorithm that generates a theoretically proper ensemble of unique conformer structures required for the accurate computation of S conf . For the conformer search problem, we employ our recently described CREST program (abbreviated from Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool), which is based on metadynamics simulations employing on-the-fly computed quantum mechanical tight-binding PES. We assume at this point that the conformer-rotamer ensembles (CRE) obtained from CREST are sufficiently complete and the', 'at the same level as S msRRHO , one would arrive at the correct population average because S msRRHO and S msRRHO,ref exactly cancel each other.The treatment would then be exact.Thus, our final working equation for the molecular entropy is given byS conf = S conf + S msRRHO .(12)The corresponding formula for the heat capacity at constant pressure isC p,conf = R i g i (E i Œ≤) 2 e -E i Œ≤ i g i e -E i Œ≤ -R i g i (E i Œ≤) e -E i Œ≤ i g i e -E i Œ≤ 2 ,(13)and the enthalpy is[H(T ) -H(0)] conf = RT i g i (E i Œ≤) e -E i Œ≤ i g i e -E i Œ≤ . (14)Note that g i is used in C p and H(T ) -H(0) instead of g i . In our opinion, basing S conf (and related properties) directly on a given level of theory via the Gibbs-Shannon entropy of an ensemble (Eq. 8 and 10) provides a genuine understanding of the quantity in accordance with chemical intuition. Furthermore, it can be very well coupled to automated conformational search tools, which are anyway necessary for accurate computation of other physical observables.3 Implementation and Computational Details']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Theoretical methods']",2533,1,1,0,0.929452114,0.606777414,['why']
"Relation to ExperimentThe simulations presented thus far have considered the absolute quantum state of the system at the end of the relevant process normalised relative to the initial state . It is not possible to normalise the experimentally determined quantum state in this way as the initial state is not determined. Instead, the fitted state was normalised by the magnitude of the calculated expectation values, and so is insensitive to an overall loss in magnetisation. This relative normalisation process can dramatically increase the experimental fidelity, especially for the simulations of the entangling gate considering anisotropic coupling frequencies. The uniformly and orientationally weighted simulations with ùúî C = 2 MHz have simulated pseudofidelities of just 0.746 and 0.820, but normalised pseudo-fidelities of 0.963 and 0.927.such we consider it more feasible to reduce the spread of couplings by orienting the ensemble, either in a single-or liquid-crystal.Orienting the sample would also narrow the spectra of anisotropic spin systems as angular distributions of spin Hamiltonian parameters will also be reduced to a single value. The oriented spectrum will still be broadened by couplings to neighbouring electron and nuclear spins, as well as the presence of different molecular conformations which will introduce distributions in ùëî-values, hyperfine couplings, and zero-field splitting parameters where relevant. As such, it is likely that the reduction of partial excitation of near resonant spin packets will require both orientation of the sample and enhanced uniformity of excitation.The bandwidth of rectangular pulses can be increased by reducing pulse lengths, however sufficiently broadband pulses would need to be of picosecond length.

However, it is clear by visual inspection that the majority of the experimental time traces are not completely flat and thus contain some form of oscillation, and that the amplitude of these oscillations is significantly lower than in the reference DEER data (DEERATom data Figures S7-S9, DEER data Figure ).The state of the system was determined by globally fitting the data for a range of values of ùëÉ =>?6 , with the lowest cost solution occurring at ùëÉ =>?6 = 0.42. The pseudo-fidelity of the entanglement and tomography combined can be calculated by comparing the deviation density matrices, which we accomplish by treating the expectation values of the non-identity Cartesian product operators as vectors in the generalised Bloch sphere. In this representation the similarity between two states can be thought of as the angle between them, and we use the cosine of this angle to define the pseudo-fidelity:‚Ñ± _ (ùúå > "" , ùúå > $ ) = ùëë -1 2ùëë cos‚à†(ùúå > "" , ùúå > $ ) + ùëë + 1 2ùëëwhere ùëë is the Hilbert dimension, and:cos‚à†(ùúå > "" , ùúå > $ ) = ùúå ‚Éó "" ‚ãÖ ùúå ‚Éó $ = e ùõº @ ùõΩ @ A @ = tr(ùúå > "" ùúå > $ ) - 1 ùëëwhere ùúå ‚Éó is the vector representation of ùúå >, and ùõº and ùõΩ are the expectation values of the basis operators in ùúå > "" and ùúå > $ , respectively (i.e. the elements of ùúå ‚Éó "" and ùúå ‚Éó $ ). Thus two directly opposing quantum states, with equal and opposite observables, will have a pseudo-fidelity of 0.25, whereas two identical quantum states will have a pseudo-fidelity of 1.00. By this', 'DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate a significant lack of fidelity; here we examine what we believe to be the most likely sources of loss of fidelity, considering the state generation and detection separately before simulating the experiment as a whole. The product operator calculations in Sections 2 and 11 were performed assuming ideal pulses, during which precession about the static Hamiltonian is neglected. A more general approach is to consider that the static Hamiltonian is always acting on the spin system, effectively tilting the axis of nutation during pulses out of the ùë•ùë¶-plane. . It is not convenient to model this effect within the product operator formalism as the static and driving Hamiltonians do not commute, and so we turn to numerical simulations to describe the evolution of the quantum state. Further details of the simulations are included in Section 12. State GenerationPrecession during pulses By considering a system in which the two spins are exactly on resonance with the applied pulses, equivalent to a single molecule, the Zeeman terms in the static Hamiltonian go to zero and only the inter-spin coupling term is active. In this case the fidelity of the simulated entangling gate oscillates with frequency ùúî )* as the inter-pulse delay is incremented (Figure ). The maxima in fidelity occur at ùúè ‚âà (2A0""):2+ !"", and there is no observable decrease in fidelity as ùëõ is increased. By contrast, both pulse length and inter-spin coupling have a significant effect on the simulated fidelity, with shorter pulses and lower inter-spin coupling frequencies enhancing the fidelity of the gate (Figure ). Precession under the influence of the inter-spin ', ""of 0.25, whereas two identical quantum states will have a pseudo-fidelity of 1.00. By this metric, the pseudo-fidelity of the fitted state (Figure and 8b, green) to the desired state (black) is 0.788. Note that the fitted experimental state was normalised by the magnitude of the calculated expectation values because the experimental starting state is unknown. This means that the measurement is insensitive to an overall loss in magnetisation, and therefore this measurement of this pseudo-fidelity is a normalised pseudo-fidelity and an upper-bound (see further discussion later in the 'Relation to experiment' section). Factors leading the loss of fidelity are examined further in Section 4, however while discussing the fitted expectation values it is pertinent to note that due to the relatively low value found for the filter pulse flip probability, the majority of the echo intensity in all traces arises from 'leakage' of unfiltered magnetisation. If the actual filter pulse efficiency is greater than the value used in the fit, then the expectation values of observables which are not single-quantum coherences will be artificially inflated as these operators cannot be detected without being affected by a filter pulse. This will be especially problematic for experiments with filter pulses at both frequencies, in which less than 20% of the fitted signal arises from the desired coherence pathway. For example, there is no pathway by which 2ùëÜ 0 % ùêº 0 % or 2ùëÜ 0 ' ùêº 0 ' magnetisation can be generated by the DFHE entangling gate, and yet these are the largest expectation values in the fitted density matrix (Figure ). This distortion of the fitted quantum state would lead to errors in the readout and thus a loss of fidelity.It is possible to qualitatively assess the fidelity of the entangling gate from the results of the While it is possible that the absence of visible sine oscillations"", 'target=""#b39"">39 Assuming all non-secular terms are negligible the strength of the dipolar coupling is given by ùúî BB = ùúî C (3 cos $ ùúÉ -1), where ùúÉ is the angle between the inter-spin vector and the external magnetic field and ùúî C is the coupling frequency when ùúÉ = 90¬∞. While each orientation of the molecule is equally likely to be present in the sample, leading to a Pake pattern of inter-spin coupling frequencies, the orientations do not contribute equally to the recorded data due to the inherent orientation selectivity of microwave pulses (Figure ). As such we can generate two models of dipolar coupling: one with uniform weights representing the sample as a whole, and one in which each orientation is weighted by the overlap of the nitroxide spectrum with the microwave pulses. The simulated fidelities of the entangling gate with ùúî C = 2 MHz for the uniform and weighted models are 0.749 and 0.821, respectively, significantly lower than the corresponding simulations considering an isotropic interaction. This decrease in fidelity is caused by interference between systems with different coupling frequencies, which diminishes the expectation values of the anti-phase coherences. The uniformly weighted simulation is more impacted by this interference as its frequency distribution is a complete Pake pattern, whereas the frequency distribution of the spectrally weighted simulation corresponds to a partial Pake pattern.In addition to the orientational disorder, molecules in frozen solution will adopt different conformations with different inter-spin distances. As a result there will be a distribution in ùúî C which will further broaden the inter-spin coupling distribution. Here we take ùúî C to be normally distributed with mean ùúá + \' and standard deviation ùúé + \' . As expected, as ùúé + \' is increased the fidelity of both models decreases (Figure ). By comparing these models to our experimental', 'right). This likely a result of the rigidity of the alkyne and phenyl groups connecting the two nitroxide spins, which will limit the distribution of conformations adopted in solution.The observed coupling distribution is likely further narrowed by the pulses used only exciting certain orientations of the nitroxide spin centre, and so not all orientations of the inter-spin vector will contribute to the oscillations (Figure ). While the distribution of inter-spin interactions could be reduced further by orienting the sample, we find that the coupling frequency is well enough defined in frozen solution to demonstrate a proof-of-principle entangling gate. The coherence times were measured by 2P-Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (2P-ESEEM) (Figure ) and the fitted value of 6.89 Œºs is significantly longer than the two-qubit gate time, which is itself significantly longer than the one-qubit gate time. This relationship between operation times make compound 1 a suitable candidate for the generation and detection of entanglement via free evolution under the inter-qubit coupling.

This difference between the higher acoustic activity observed with the cathode relative to the anode, particularly at current densities above 200-300 mA cm -2 is more clearly observed by studying the cumulative energy of the acoustic hits (Figure (b)). Thus far, the focus has been on the number of hits recorded, which gives a good indication of the acoustic activity but does not include all information. By looking at the cumulative energy, this not only takes into account the total number of hits but other factors associated with each hit such as the duration and frequency of each hit.

This selection varies not only in structures and photophysical properties, but also in redox potentials, while encompassing the most commonly used catalysts for photoredox reactions (Figure ). The Ksv for the different photocatalyst are reported in Table . For low Ksv values, the entry is shown as <5. In such cases, higher concentrations of quenchers will be needed to determine Ksv.  Interestingly, we observed entries exhibiting negative deviations from linearity in their quenching profiles, mostly with Hantzsch ester (Figure ) and diethylbromomalonate. This type of behavior has been attributed to the presence of different conformers for the photocatalyst, which give rise to a fractional accessibility of the fluorophore. Some cases cases can be treated using a modified Stern-Volmer equation, namely the Lehrer equation. It should be noted that the Hantzsch ester, unlike the other quenchers, also has a non-negligeable absorbance up to 400 nm and emits at 450 nm, which overlaps with the absorbance and emission of a few of the selected photocatalysts, thereby creating an inner filter effect which interferes with the Stern Volmer measurement. Therefore, data for this particular quencher might not reflect the true photocatalyst quenching rate. Overall, we observed strong quenching from trialkyl amines with typically oxidative excited photocatalysts (Figure ), which is unsurprising considering their wide use as quenchers in many photoredox reactions. DIPEA is the substrate that exhibits quenching with most photocatalysts in the collection.

Conversely, oxidative quenchers like diethylbromomalonate tend to only react with strongly reducing photocatlysts such as Ir(ppy)3. However, further data analysis of Ksv values of the quenchers in relation to the oxidation potential of the photocatalyst excited state show that, interestingly, these two entities are not necessarily related. For example, quenching values for triethylamine shows no clear correlation between Ksv and excited state oxidation potential (Figure ). Other phenomena such as pH, binding events, exciplex formation or hydrogen bonding have been shown to influence quenching. Solvent effects also have a role, as illustrated by the 1.7 fold higher Ksv between Ir(ppy)3 and diethylbromomalonitrile in acetonitrile compared to that in DCE. Additionally, phenylacetic acid showed very little quenching with all photocatalysts, but the quenching rate for this specific quencher is likely dependent on pH with the deprotonated carboxylate being more susceptible to oxidation. An interesting quencher is (TMS)3SiOH, which has been used recently in several metallophotoredox reactions, and which shows interesting quenching patterns. Indeed, while most reported systems including (TMS)3SiOH involve Ir photocatalysts, we can observe much higher quenching with acridiniums and organocatalysts such as N-Et-Flavin and DCA. These photocatalysts could therefore outperform Ir in systems relying on this quencher. Interestingly, two photocatalysts, namely tetraMeO-Acr-N-Ph and tetraMeO-Acr-N-diMeOPh, show some degree of quenching with all the quenchers tested (Figure ), which', 'used photocatalysts and quenchers in a rapid fashion. We automated the plate preparation by writing a protocol to direct a liquid handling robot (Tecan Freedom EVO 100) to dispense the solutions of photocatalyst and quencher into 96-well plates. First, one photocatalyst was dispensed across the entire plate. We maintained the quencher concentration as the variable across rows and selected 12 widely used quenchers for the columns. With this design, one photocatalyst could be analyzed on a plate in less than one minute. The automated liquid dispensing allowed us to prepare plates for each of 20 common photocatalysts in <2 h entirely under inert atmosphere (Figure ) for a total of 1920 samples to generate 220 quenching constants.The 12 quenchers were N,N-Diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, 4-methoxystyrene, Hantzsch ester, quinuclidine, bis(pinacolato)diboron, phenylacetic acid, tris(trimethylsylil)silanol, and potassium cyclohexyltrifluoroborate as reductive quenchers and di-tert-butyl peroxide and diethylbromomalonate as oxidative quenchers (sodium persulfate was included as well but exhibited low solubility in MeCN such that no quenching was measured and reported). These quenchers were selected for their wide use in many different photoredox reactions. Trialkylamines are typically used as a sacrificial reductant to enable access to a highly reducing photocatalyst and, as such, are used in a wide range of reactions. The other reagents contain functional groups that will typically generate reactive radicals upon photocatalyst quenching, and that will undergo the desired reactivity. The photocatalysts were selected to contain diverse chemical structures such as cyanoarene-based photocatalysts, acridinium salts, ruthenium (II) complexes, iridium (III) complexes and', 'quenching with all the quenchers tested (Figure ), which explains their increased use as versatile photocatalysts. On the contrary, photocatalysts such as Ru(phen)3Cl2 and Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2, one of the most important photocatalyst that launched the entire field of photoredox catalysis, exhibits fairly poor quenching with most substrates, which explains its decline in usage against more reactive Ir photocatalysts.In conclusion, we demonstrated the use of a highthroughput workflow for the measurements of Stern-Volmer quenching constants using commercially available fluorescence plate readers and 96-well plates. We validated the method by comparing the results to reported quenching values. Automatization of the liquid dispensing step allowed for the rapid preparation and analysis of the Stern-Volmer quenching for a collection of common photocatalysts and quenchers. We believe this workflow enables a consistent and rapid collection of quenching constants with readily available instrumentation, thereby finally bringing Stern-Volmer studies to the same level of high throughput capabilities as those for reaction discovery for photoredox catalysis. We believe this method, as well as the data generated is truly enabling for the community interested in mechanistic understanding of photoredox reactions.Experimental section: Chemicals and Materials: Unless stated otherwise, all the reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers (Acros, Merck Millipore Sigma, TCI America, Fisher Scientific, etc) and were of the highest analytical purity. UPLC grade solvents were used for all experiments. All operations we performed inside of a N2-filled glovebox. For the high throughput experiments, 96-well uv-star¬Æ microplates (part number 655809) were used. For the validation experiments, the microplate used was a 96-well quartz microplate (part', 'Results and DiscussionIn photoredox reactions, the first step in the photochemical cycle is excitation of the photocatalyst by a photon of the appropriate wavelength. Upon excitation, the photocatalyst can decay back to the ground state in a radiative (via photon emission, i.e. fluorescence or phosphorescence) or non-radiative way (heat) (Figure ). In the presence of increased concentration of a quencher, the photocatalyst excited state can also react via EnT or PET, which will compete with radiative decays and ultimately decrease photon emission (Figure ). The decrease in emission intensity is linked to the concentration of quencher as described by the Stern-Volmer equation (equation 1):ùêº 0 ùêº = 1 + ùëò ùëû ùúè 0 [ùëÑ] (1)where I0 is the emission intensity in the absence of quencher, I is the intensity in the presence of quencher, kq is the quenching constant, \uf0740 is the excited state lifetime and [Q] is the quencher concentration. The product of kq and \uf0740 is often described as Ksv, the Stern-Volmer constant. KSV can be used to compare quenching rates between different quenchers (Figure ). The knowledge of Ksv and [Q] for all the components of a reaction enables the ranking of quenching power and ultimately identification of the main quencher for the photocatalyst.In a typical Stern Volmer experiment, independent solutions of different concentrations of quenchers and a constant concentration of photocatalyst need to be prepared under a rigorously inert atmosphere, and the excitation intensity of each one must be measured separately to extract I and build the Stern Volmer plot. We decided to take advantage of', 'rapid discovery of new photoredox reactions. To keep up with the exponentially increasing chemical space for photoredox transformations, new workflows that enable Stern-Volmer data collection at a higher throughput need to be developed.To that end, we have devised a protocol for the collection of Stern-Volmer quenching data using commercially available fluorescence plate readers and consumable 96-well plates. Plate readers are ubiquitous in biological studies and have been used in a variety of colorimetric and fluorometric assays, as they allow for rapid (<1 min) reading of an entire 96-well plate. In our quenching studies, the use of well-plates enables the collection of Stern-Volmer constants for one photocatalyst and up to 12 quenchers in less than a minute. We further expanded the throughput of this workflow by devising a protocol for a liquid handling robot to enable the automated dispensing of quenchers at increasing concentrations in a 96-well plate format. This allowed us to rapidly prepare multiple plates of 20 commonly used photocatalysts, and for each, measure the Stern-Volmer constants of 11 common quenchers. The 220 quenching rates table generated opens the door for deeper data analysis of quenching trends and mechanisms, and we believe will be useful to the community interested in mechanistic understanding of photoredox catalysis.']","['Spectroscopy', 'Optical spectroscopy']",254,1,1,0,0.910567103,0.328336378,['why']

The operators diagonal in electronic state index have real-valued Lagrange multipliers. The superscripts on the Lagrange multipliers designate the two electronic states and the subscript is an index of the operator, see table I and S3.1 of the SM. In contrast to the closed algebra case, the Lagrange multiplier of the number operator is changing in time, and in opposite way for the ground and excited electronic states (black and green line, respectively). The off-diagonal in electronic state index number operator has a much smaller Lagrange multiplier that beats with the frequency of the energy gap between the two electronic states. As the two potentials are the same the gap does not depend on the nuclear coordinate, therefore there is only a constant beating frequency. These Lagrange multipliers are the same for the two initial states considered.! { } ‚Ä† ‚Ä† 2 ‚Ä† , ,The Lagrange multipliers are conjugate to the observables.

When the algebra is not closed we determine the time dependence of the Lagrange multipliers from the general result, Eq. ( ). Different approximations to the surprisal are then obtained depending on which operators are kept in the expansion . We show results for the smallest possible closed set of operators where already one obtains physically realistic results, the next larger algebra where the results are accurate to graph plotting accuracy and an even larger algebra where the convergence is rather acceptable.We examine the accuracy of the presented approach on the effects of the coherence between the vibrational and electronic states for two qualitatively different initial pure states:√é(t) = Œª p (t) Bp p ‚àë p l Bp √é(t) = Œª p (t) Bp p ‚àë(a) a coherent superposition of a very few vibrational states with the main population in the state, and (b) a coherent superposition of a larger number of excited vibrational states centered about .

This represents the case when the algebra is not closed.Even so we can identify a few dominant constraints.

"spin Hamiltonian varying as a function of time, causing an effective oscillating magnetic field). Reducing the impact of nuclear spin diffusion has been widely studied (7-11), and removal of nuclear spins from the qubit and/or embedding the molecule in a nuclear-spin-free lattice is a proven method to obtain phase memory times long enough to permit demonstration of coherent spin manipulation via Rabi oscillations (9-11), sometimes even at room temperature (11). However, reducing the impact of molecular vibrations is a challenge. The intuitive approach is to reduce the influence of molecular vibrations by making a more rigid molecule or lattice, which does lead to longer phase memory times (11).We noted a study where Zn + ions, encapsulated in a metal-organic framework, show phase memory times of 2 ¬µs at room temperature (14). This is ascribed to the unpaired electron being in a 2 S state, i.e. a state with no orbital angular momentum. The highly isotropic nature of this state protects the electron spin phase from variations in local magnetic field caused by structural distortions. Therefore, we sought a molecular species that would mimic the highly isotropic nature of these embedded Zn + ions. All molecular qubits proposed thus far have the unpaired electron spin in a p-, d-or f-orbital and have little s-character. Our target was a molecule with a 2 S ground state.We identified a family of molecules that might exemplify this strategy. The compounds are threecoordinate with local pseudo-C 3 symmetry at the metal ion. In this point group, the lowest energy dorbital is d z2 and it has the same irreducible representation as an s-orbital; therefore, the s-and d z2 orbitals will mix and regardless of the relative admixture of the two atomic orbitals, an S-like state will result.

Our calculations show that this is due to quenched orbital angular momentum in the ground state; vibrational modulation of gor A-anisotropy is minimized because of the near-isotropic nature of these two parameters, effectively rendering the two-level quantum system insensitive to environmental and molecular vibrations.. The isotropic nature of the spin Hamiltonian is also consistent with the observation that there is no significant variation in relaxation dynamics for different orientations, despite the 4d z 2 admixture to the SOMO. The distinction between 1 and other proposed molecular qubits is clear when comparing the relaxation behaviour of, for example, complexes of V(IV) or Cu(II) (both S = 1/2) which have much larger g and A M anisotropies owing to the 3d-dominated ground configurations (8,9,11,26), despite having broadly similar spin orbit coupling constants to Y.Hence, we conclude the very robust relaxation behaviour of 1 is intrinsically associated with the isotropic electronic structure, which is due to practically nil orbital angular momentum in the ground state. The near isotropic magnetic properties mean that 1 is behaving spectroscopically like an atomic 2 S-state.Preliminary solution phase studies and calculations of 2 -4 show this is a general phenomenon (see Supplementary Information); 4 contains amide ligands, not Cp ligands, and hence the phenomenon is due to engineering the electronic structure of the metal and not due to a specific ligand.The utility of a 2 S 1/2 -like electronic ground state has long been exploited in trapped atom/ion qubits studied at milli-Kelvin temperatures (27-29).

There has also been a report of the implementation of the Grover algorithm in a four-level molecular qudit (13). A major challenge is to protect the spin qubit from noise that causes loss of phase information; strategies to minimize the impact of noise on qubits can be categorized as corrective, reductive, or protective. Corrective approaches allow noise and correct for its impact on the qubit using advanced microwave pulse sequences (3). Reductive approaches reduce the noise by minimising the number of nearby nuclear spins (7-11), and increasing the rigidity of molecules to minimise the effect of vibrations (which can cause a fluctuating magnetic field via spin-orbit coupling) (9,11); this is essentially engineering the ligand shell surrounding the electron spin. A protective approach would seek to make the qubit less sensitive to noise: an example of the protective approach is the use of clock transitions to render spin states immune to magnetic fields at first order (12). Here we present a further protective method that would complement reductive and corrective approaches to enhancing quantum coherence in molecular qubits. The target is a molecular spin qubit with an effective 2 S ground state: we achieve this with a family of divalent rare-earth molecules that have negligible magnetic anisotropy such that the isotropic nature of the electron spin renders the qubit markedly less sensitive to magnetic noise, allowing coherent spin manipulations even at room temperature.

Progress in material science and chemistry has led to several distinct classes of optical materials, e.g., molecular probes, supramolecules, amorphous polymers, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have remarkably promoted the advancement of detection of chemical and biological analytes. <ref type=""bibr""",Causal,Why does the JUC-557-nanosheet architecture show high absolute quantum yields and excellent sensing performance toward specific analytes?,Answer not available from the given context. ,Negative,"['Owing to the synergistic effect of AIE-and ACQ-based chromophores in JUC-557-nanosheet, this architecture shows high absolute quantum yields (up to 23.0%) in solid state and the dispersed in various solvents and excellent sensing performance toward specific analytes, such as iodine (Ka: 2.10 x 10^5 M-1 and LOD: 302 ppb), 2,4,6trinitrotoluene (Ka: 4.38 x 10^5 M-1 and LOD: 129 ppb), and especially nitrobenzene (Ka: 6.18 x 10^6 M-1).']","[[367, 999]]","['ConclusionIn summary, we have successfully obtained a carbazole-based sp 2 carbon COF nanosheet, JUC-557nanosheet, with a thickness about 2.5 nm by exfoliating the corresponding pristine bulk powder. Owing to the synergistic effect of the AIE-molecular rotors (PE) and ACQ-based chromophore units (carbazole), JUC-557-nanosheet demonstrates high absolute quantum yields (up to 23.0%) in both solid-state and solution. Also, electron-rich carbazole and electron-deficient cyan are uniformly distributed and exposed on the channel wall, rendering efficient combining with the analytes for detection. Therefore, JUC-557nanosheet as a sensitive fluorescence sensor exhibits an excellent molecular recognition toward the essential element in the human body (Fe 3+ with K a of 1.98 \uf0b4 10 4 M -1 and LOD of 706 ppb), radioactive contaminant (I 2 with K a of 2.10 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and LOD of 302 ppb), explosive (TNT with K a of 4.38 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and LOD of 129 ppb), and especially toxic nitro-compounds (such as NB with K a of 6.18 \uf0b4 10 6 M -1 and LOD of 5 ppb), which is far superior to previous fluorescence detection materials, including COFs, MOFs, POPs, small molecule probes, and inorganics. Due to its high chemical stability, JUC-557nanosheet exhibits a good luminescence and sensitive molecule recognition even under extreme conditions, such as in strong acid with pH = 1 or strong base with pH = 14. Moreover, JUC-557-nanosheet can be assembled into visual detection equipment, allowing easy optical trace detection of various analytes. Finally, the molecular recognition mechanism was investigated by a combined theoretical and experimental studies, including TRPL measurements, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations.

Furthermore, its fluorescence quenching mechanism has been demonstrated to be a synergistic effect of static quenching and energy transfer quenching by a combined theoretical and experimental study, including time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. As a chemically stable material, JUC-557-nanosheet preserves strong luminescence and sensitive recognition even under harsh conditions (such as strong acid with pH = 1 or strong base with pH = 14), and allows trace detection of various analytes via a handheld UV lamp. Therefore, these findings pave the way for developing stable ultrathin COF nanomaterials for highly sensitive and selective molecular detection. chemistry, making them easily be modified to create ideal functionalized materials. Theoretically, the high designability of construction in COFs is more accessibly designed as a monitor of molecular recognition via increasable adsorption sites and adjustable fluorescence for targeted analytes. For instance, Wang group reported a thioether-functionalized COF with multifunctionality, COF-LZU8, for the selective detection and facile removal of mercury(II). Qiu et al. developed a sp 2 carbon-conjugated fluorescent COF, termed TFPT-BTAN-AO, which shows a fast response time and a low detection limit suitable for detection of UO 2 2+', 'which shows a fast response time and a low detection limit suitable for detection of UO 2 2+ in H 2 O. Nevertheless, because of the scarcity of a suitable linkage that combines fluorescence with stability, most fluorescent COFs are chemically fragile, and stable COFs are less illuminating. Therefore, exploring highly stable and fluorescent COF materials for chemical detection still remains a great challenge.Herein, we design a carbazole-based COF nanosheet connected by sp 2 carbons, termed JUC-557nanosheet, which is exfoliated from its bulk COF (JUC-557, JUC = Jilin University China). Due to the complementary characteristic of phenyl ethylene (PE) as an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) group and carbazole as an aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) chromophore in the same framework, JUC-557-nanosheet was proven to have high absolute quantum yields of ~ 23.0% in both solid-state and solution. Therefore, JUC-557-nanosheet as a sensitive fluorescence probe exhibits an excellent molecular recognition toward specific cations and anions as well as iodine (I 2 ) and toxic nitro-compounds, bringing forth I 2 with an association constant (K a ) of 2.10 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and limit of detection (LOD) of 302 ppb, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) with K a of 4.38 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 and LOD of 129 ppb, and especially nitrobenzene (NB) with K a of 6.18 \uf0b4 10 6 M -1 and LOD of 5 ppb, which is much better than those optical detection materials reported until now, including fluorescence porous materials, small molecule probes and inorganics. Furthermore, a combined theoretical and experimental study, including time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations, explains the fluorescence quenching mechanism of JUC-557nanosheet.

As outstanding fluorescence sensors, the primary indicators include some important advantages, such as selectivity, sensitivity, and durability in complex and even harsh chemical environments.

Fig. shows the computed multipliers for three successive powers, . The successive values decline by two orders of magnitude per increasing power. To a limited extent this is compensated by successive mean value being somewhat higher but the overall tendency is that the terms that originate in the failure of the algebra to close do not contribute significantly. The dominant constraints in the surprisal are the trio that generate the tridiagonal structure of the surprisal matrix. This set of constraints is sufficient when the algebra is closed. Adding as constraints leads to a penta-diagonal surprisal and, as discussed above, is a sufficiently accurate approximation. As dynamics unfolds on several electronic states and the coherence effects are prominent (the rate of change of the populations is determined by the coherences see Eq. (S3.8) in section S3.1 of the SM) it needs several dominant constraints in each electronic state. However, it is still much less, as compared to the universal finite basis representation (or the Gelfand basis,), see table II.

When the algebra is not closed we determine the time dependence of the Lagrange multipliers from the general result, Eq. ( ). Different approximations to the surprisal are then obtained depending on which operators are kept in the expansion . We show results for the smallest possible closed set of operators where already one obtains physically realistic results, the next larger algebra where the results are accurate to graph plotting accuracy and an even larger algebra where the convergence is rather acceptable.We examine the accuracy of the presented approach on the effects of the coherence between the vibrational and electronic states for two qualitatively different initial pure states:√é(t) = Œª p (t) Bp p ‚àë p l Bp √é(t) = Œª p (t) Bp p ‚àë(a) a coherent superposition of a very few vibrational states with the main population in the state, and (b) a coherent superposition of a larger number of excited vibrational states centered about .

This represents the case when the algebra is not closed.Even so we can identify a few dominant constraints.

An accurate representation of the density will often require imposing the mean values of several constraints as shown for example in Fig. . Defining the numerical value of the Lagrange multiplier by the condition that the density reproduces the mean value of the conjugate observable leads to an implicit, transcendental, equation.

So exact propagation of the surprisal on a finite basis will be computationally demanding. However, the dynamics of the Lagrange multipliers of the dominant constraints may be sufficient for most purposes. This opens a different way of approximating the quantum dynamics in many-body systems, a subject for future research.In section II we show that if the initial state of a system is described as a state of maximal entropy, a finite set of time-dependent constraints is sufficient to reproduce the surprisal at all subsequent times. During a unitary time-evolution the rank of the density matrix is conserved so the number of the time-dependent constraints is the same as the number of constraints on the initial state. In section II we further describe the special circumstances where an algebraically delineated finite set of time-independent constraints is sufficient to describe the dynamics. The algebraic procedure to convert the dynamics of the surprisal to a compact evolution of the Lagrange multipliers is introduced. Section III discusses the proposed computational scheme for an exact dynamical evolution of the surprisal in a finite dimensional space.

This is apparent in the intense yellow color displayed by solutions of azupyrene, whereas solutions of pyrene are colorless (See insets in Figure ). In agreement with the yellow color of azupyrene, the UV/Vis spectrum (Figure ) shows an absorption peak for azupyrene at a photon energy of 2.6 eV, in the blue part of the visible range. Pyrene has its lowest energy peak at a much higher photon energy of 3.7 eV, well outside the visible range. The resulting optical excitation energies, determined from the rising edge of the peak, are 2.54 eV for azupyrene and 3.63 eV for pyrene, yielding a difference of 1.09 eV. Our ab initio calculations within the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) approach (see vertical lines in Figure ) overestimate the absolute excitation energies for both molecules. However, the calculations yield a difference in transition energies of 1.10 eV between azupyrene and pyrene, in excellent agreement with the experiment. It should be noted that while the lowest energy excitation corresponds to the transition from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO‚ÜíLUMO) in pyrene, this transition is symmetry forbidden for azupyrene and the peak in the visible range has to be attributed to the transition into a higher lying unoccupied orbital (HOMO‚ÜíLUMO+1).

The calculated NEXAFS transitions have already been published in context of method development.

The C1s signals are centered at 284.66 eV for azupyrene and 284.81 eV for pyrene with respect to the Fermi energy EF. The azupyrene peak shows a larger width (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 1.16 eV) and is slightly asymmetric with a shoulder at the high binding energy side. The pyrene peak is symmetric and has a smaller width (FWHM = 0.94 eV). The differences in peak shape and peak width can be explained with the help of DFT calculations, which provide the binding energies for the individual carbon atoms in the molecules. For this purpose, the core-electron binding energies were calculated with a localized core-hole in a \uf044SCF scheme and compared to the experimental data by way of a fitting procedure. In this procedure, the relative binding energies and relative intensities (given by the number of symmetry equivalent carbon atoms) were taken as fixed parameters forming the overall theoretical C 1s peak of the molecule as sum over the equivalent carbon sub peaks, each represented by a pseudo-Voigt peak. The single-peakwidth and the Gaussian-to-Lorentzian ratio were constricted to be equal for all sub peaks and were parameters of the fit procedure together with the overall intensity and a global energy shift. As can be seen in Figure ,b, the agreement between experiment and theory is remarkably good, allowing us to explain the peak shape based on the theoretical model. According to this analysis, the asymmetry of the azupyrene peak is caused by the more distinctly different chemical environments of its carbon atoms. Especially the signal related to the carbon atoms in the central bridge (blue in Figure ) is', 'carbon K-edge NEXAFS spectra (Figure ) show intense \uf070* resonances at low photon energy (284 to 287 eV) and less intense \uf073* resonances at higher photon energies (>287 eV). The first \uf070* resonance of pyrene has two maxima, which are caused by the C1s‚ÜíLUMO and C1s‚ÜíLUMO+1 excitations, as was ascertained by MO-projected NEXAFS simulations (see Figure in the SI and Ref. ). For azupyrene, the individual excitations in the first peak are not resolved, because the corresponding LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals are too close in energy. For both molecules, the MO-projected NEXAFS simulations show that the leading edge of the adsorption peak is determined by the C1s‚ÜíLUMO excitation.The X-ray absorption edge of azupyrene appears at a lower photon energy by 0.37 eV than that of pyrene, as can be seen in Figure . Since the core-level energies differ only marginally, it can therefore be concluded that the LUMO of azupyrene is lower in energy. Theory also predicts the LUMO of azupyrene to be lower in energy, here the magnitude is 0.60 eV.Combination of the experimental differences of electron addition and removal energies from UPS and NEXAFS data indicate that the electronic band gap is 0.72 eV (= 0.37 eV + 0.35 eV) smaller for azupyrene than for pyrene. For comparison, the calculations yield a value of 0.87 eV for the difference in electronic band gap, which is in good agreement with the experimental finding. In addition, the calculations can provide the absolute electronic band gaps, which are not accessible by the experimental techniques at our disposal. The calculated absolute electronic band gaps are 2.96 eV and 3.83 eV for azupyrene and pyrene, respectively.

These restrictions have also hampered the adoption of new AI technologies into the field . As a consequence, researchers increasingly resort to developing inhouse scripts for RS analysis in Python , further adding to methodological fragmentation and lack of standardisation .In response to these challenges, we have developed RamanSPy -a modular, open-source framework for integrated Raman Spectroscopy analytics in Python. RamanSPy is designed to systematise day-to-day workflows, enhance algorithmic development and validation, and accelerate the adoption of novel AI technologies into the RS field. Firstly, RamanSPy serves as a platform for general-purpose RS analytics supporting the RS data life cycle by providing a suite of ready-to-use modules for data loading, preprocessing, analysis and visualisation. By design, these functionalities are not tied to any specific technology or data type, thereby allowing integrative and transferable Fig. General Raman spectroscopy workflow and core features of RamanSPy . a, RamanSPy supports the Raman spectroscopic data analysis life cycle via a modular, loosely coupled architecture. RS data is parsed to a common data representation format, which is interfaced with preprocessing, analysis and visualisation tools within RamanSPy. The core features of RamanSPy include a comprehensive library of standardised, simple-touse procedures for data loading, preprocessing, analysis and visualisation. These modules are flexible and allow the incorporation of further techniques and in-house methods. For complete information about the modules', 'standard Python AI/ML methods (e.g., from scikit-learn , PyTorch and tensorflow ) as tools for RS analysis (Fig. ). As an illustration, we use RamanSPy to construct a deep learning denoising procedure based on the one-dimensional ResUNet model -a fully convolutional UNet neural network with residual connections . To do this, we simply wrap within RamanSPy the pre-trained neural network (trained on spectra from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, available at https://github.com/conor-horgan/DeepeR) as a custom denoising method. Once wrapped, the denoiser is automatically compatible with the rest of RamanSPy and can be readily employed for different applications. For instance, we replicate the results in , and show in Fig. that the application of this deep-learning denoiser to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) test set from consistently outperforms the commonly-used Savitzky-Golay filter , as quantified by various metrics also coded within RamanSPy (e.g., mean squared error (MSE), spectral angle distance (SAD) and spectral information divergence (SID) ).

These terms do not change monotonically with respect to parameter changes. Fig. demonstrate the changes in max SDEM induced by changes in the partition parameters, and none of the partition parameter changes can lead to a smaller max SDEM at all times. For example, a smaller W buf can be expected to lead to smaller SDEM, since there are less ‚àÇV /‚àÇ Œª Œ≤ terms which are observed to have the same sign in many situations. This can be achieved with smaller R QM max , Œæ QM min and larger Œæ semi min , Œæ QM max .

This can also be seen from the v max curves in Fig. (b), as the first dip of the QM/MM curve at about 0.009 ps is much shallower than the first dips of the SW and the M-M/MM curves. The magnitude of the MM/MM v max change at about 0.024 ps is close to that of the QM/MM curve, showing the effect of the ZBL short-range interaction. Fig. shows that the damaged region grows slower in QM/MM as the peaks of the QM/MM curves occur later than those of the SW and the MM/MM curves. This agrees with the recently reported machine learning results, where the number of interstitials reaches the maximum later than in simulations with SW or Tersoff potentials. The machine learning potential is also found to behave similarly as the SW potential for the annealing process in terms of N int . This corroborates the validness of the QM/MM simulation of this paper, whose annealing stage is controlled by the SW potential according to Fig. .More atoms are treated with the higher-level method in QM/MM than in MM/MM according to Fig. (c), indicating a larger disordered region in the QM/MM simulation. This is seen clearly in the snapshots of Fig. where the disordered region generated in the QM/MM simulation is more extended in the y and z directions.

All the atomic potential energies are calculated with the SW potential so that the results can be compared directly.

Fig. plots the number of interstitials (N int ) in panel (a) and the number of disordered atoms (N am ) in panel (b). It shows that the defect generation finishes at about 0.15 ps, and most of this process is described by the \'higher-level\' method in AC/SDAC simulations, since the QM/buffer regions exist at least for 0.1 ps according to Fig. . Fig. confirms this as the curves of AC/SDAC simulations are close to the Tersoff/ZBL curve for the first 0.1 ps. After 0.1 ps, the dynamics is described by the \'lower-level\' SW potential in the AC simulations and the SDAC simulation without transition forces, and the curves of these simulations in Fig. slowly deviate from the Tersoff/ZBL curve.Due to the unphysical heating of the buffer region by transition forces, the QM/buffer regions of the SDAC simulation with transition forces does not vanish until about 6.3 ps. The deviation of the Œæ', 'and lower-level methods of QM/MM differ a lot. I find that discarding the transition forces in SDAC simulations leads to obvious improvements to the simulations, although this may not remove all the artifacts since the simulated system is not fully thermostated.Although the machine-learning potential by Hamedani, et al is an important advancement of simulation methods of the DD. it is still worthwhile to develop an QM/MM method that combines the accuracy and explicit treatment of electrons of methods and the efficiency of classical MM potentials as an alternative way to simulate the DD process. The black box nature of the machine-learning potential makes it difficult to estimate the accuracy in cases beyond its training set. The form of the machine-learning potential remains classical and does not treat electrons explicitly, so it is not clear whether it is able to fully describe the influence of electron-phonon coupling and of the disturbance of the electronic structure by fast-moving recoil ions. Although SDAC simulations have to use a ground-state QM method and are still missing non-adiabatic effects, the SDAC method provides a framework on which improvements that allow non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) can be made, considering excited-state QM methods have been successfully applied in regular QM/MM. The preliminary SDAC QM/MM simulation presented in this work is able to reproduce many of the characteristics of the machine-learning results, despite remaining', 'SDAC QM/MM simulation of the DD generation in bulk SiliconIn the following, I demonstrate the SDAC method with actual QM/MM simulations using DFTB and the SW potential as the QM and the MM method- Fig. plots the same quantities as in Fig. . A S-DAC QM/MM simulation with transition forces is carried out for comparison, whose curves are plotted in the insets of Fig. , and such a simulation stops at about 0.12 ps as the buffer regions begin to touch the temperature controlling layer. The temperature in the inset of Fig. (a) increases over time, showing that the QM/MM artificial heating due to transition forces is much worse than that of MM/MM comparing with Fig. . This signifies the large difference in the description of the interactions in the QM and MM methods, which determines the sizes of the transition forces through ‚àÇV /‚àÇ Œª Œ± . The SDEM in the QM/MM simulation is in the range of [-2.5, 0], which is about 10 times larger than the Œæ full curve of Fig. , but still small comparing with the atomic mass of Si.

The average temper- atures in Fig. (a) show that the dissipation of the excess energy of the PKA is slower in QM/MM than in SW or in MM/MM, which suggests that the QM (DFTB) interaction is in general weaker than the MM interactions (both the SW and the Tersoff/ZBL potentials).

The deviation of the Œæ full curve from the Tersoff/ZBL curve is consequently not as much as other AC and SDAC curves after 0.1 ps. This is not an advantage, however, since other aspects of the dynamics (such as v max ) become worse.The number of defects stabilizes as the system cools down to 300 K at about 10 ps. For SDAC with/without transition forces, the numbers of defects left at 10 ps are either in between that of the SW and the Tersoff/ZBL potentials or very close to that of the SW potential. For AC simulations, however, the numbers of defects left at 10 ps are much less. This demonstrates the deficiency of the AC method in the simulation of DD generation. The AC method can only partition the system according to geometrical criteria. With the AC method, the collision of atoms is treated with the higher-level method only after atoms are very close to each other, and is treated with the lowerlevel method when atoms are not close enough (Fig. ), so the description of the collision process is inconsistent. This affects the geometries of the defect clusters and leads to the much faster healing of damage. The entire collision process is described consistently by the higher-level method in SDAC simulations, and the resulting annealing behaviors in Fig. are more reasonable.Fig. shows the geometries of the amorphous disordered regions in the simulations at 0.15 ps and at 10 ps.

In the Tersoff/ZBL simulation, a large number of disordered atoms remains, and most of them belong to a large cluster. The dynamics of the annealing process for all AC/SDAC simulations is determined by the SW potential, but the resulting stabilized disordered regions have very different shapes. The AC simulations end up with very few disordered atoms and does not resemble the results of both the SW and the Tersoff/ZBL simulations. For the SDAC simulations, the numbers of disordered atoms at 10 ps are almost the same as that of the SW simulation according to Fig. , but the geometry of the disordered region retains some of the characters of that of the Tersoff/ZBL simulation, since the disordered atoms are mostly gathered in a large cluster.""]","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Unclassified']",229,1,1,0,0.887757153,1.618612168,['why']
"IntroductionTransition metal catalysis is governed by the influence of multiple factors; however, most crucial are the following three: Metals, substrates and ligands. Among the plethora of ligands used in transition metal catalysis phosphines have been demonstrated to be an invaluable ligand class in a variety of transformations. Buchwald and co -workers have developed the so-called Buchwaldtype phosphines, which have been shown to occupy two coordination sites in low -valent Pd-complexes (Figure ). In addition to the P-Pd interaction an Œ∑ 1 -Pd-Cipso bonding interaction was found in the complex LPd(dba) (L = 2 -(2¬¥,6¬¥dimethoxybiphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine; dba = dibenzylidene-acetone). The 2-biphenyl moiety in this ligand class has allowed to achieve the challenging coupling of aryl chlorides and extremel y hindered aryl boronic acids in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Since their initial synthesis various Buchwald-type phosphines have been presented and are now comm ercially available (e.g. JohnPhos). In order to access the electronic properties of phosphines usually Tolman's cone angle and/or electronic parameter (TPE) are utilized, allowing to measure direct ligand metal interactions. In contrast to Pd-catalysis (with mostly square planar complexes), in gold(I)-catalysis the linear coordination mode at gold is operational. This forces substrates into trans-position of the ligand, which enhances its electronic effects. Cationic gold complexes are well suited for the electrophilic activation of alkynes and their subsequent",Causal,Why have Buchwald-type phosphines been particularly effective in achieving the challenging coupling of aryl chlorides and extremely hindered aryl boronic acids in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions?,Answer not available from the given context. ,Negative,"['Among the plethora of ligands used in transition metal catalysis phosphines have been demonstrated to be an invaluable ligand class in a variety of transformations.

These Buchwald-type ligands with flanking mesityl groups have been shown to possess attractive interactions between the gold center and one of the flanking mesityl groups, as was ascertained by determination of the molecular structures of a series of gold complexes 2, 3, 4 and 5.The percent buried volume of 1b amounts to ca. 55% and a linear fit of known TEP-values with their respective gas phase structures (obtained by DFT studies) revealed that particularly 1b can be classified as electron-rich phosphine and their application in the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes was tested. Preparing catalyst solutions by chloride ion abstraction from 2 with AgX salts, sometimes the formation of the respective dimeric Ag-complexes [(L)Ag-¬µ-Cl]2 6a and 6b was noted, which were independently synthesized. This is another example that AgCl contamination can result in erroneous catalyst screening results. Screening of the catalytic reaction conditions showed efficient hydroamination to take place at 60¬∞C in MeCN with a catalyst loading of 4 of 1 mol% and moderate to excellent yields were achieved for bulky anilines such as Dip-NH2 and different phenyl acetylene derivatives. No obvious difference in performance between ligands 1a and 1b was noted. In summary, terphenylbisaminophosphines meet the criteria of efficient ligands for intermolecular gold-catalyzed hydroamination reactions, as they combine strong donor properties with the 2-biphenyl structural motif, which is needed to enhance complex stability during catalysis.', 'mode was chosen for the evaluation of the donor parameters. To fit the theoretical frequencies to experimental values, the œÖtheor.(CO) for eleven different complexes [LNi(CO)3] were calculated and a linear dependency with respect to their experimental TEP values was noted (Figure ). Complexes were chosen to span from extremely electron-rich phosphazenyl phosphines to electron-poor phosphines such as PCl3 and PF3 giving a range of experimental TEPs from 2017.3 to 2110.8 cm -1 . A linear regression allowed to derive the TEPNi values for ligands 1a and 1b of 2059.6 cm -1 and 2053.0 cm -1 , respectively. This is more electron rich than classical PPh3 and approaches the donor strength of IMes, while the more electron rich IAPs and phosphazenyl phosphines are not surpassed. Especially 1b is a stronger donor (based on TEPNi) than P t Bu3 and falls in the range of newly developed YPhos ligands. 2019 Carmona, Nicasio and co-workers described a series of nickel carbonyl complexes of dialkylterphenyl phosphines, and the A1 mode for [(TerPMe2)Ni(CO)3] was detected at 2063 cm -1 . This illustrates the influence of the amino groups on phosphorus to render ligands 1a and 1b more electron rich and thus as a class with superior donor properties for the gold -catalyzed hydroamination of alkynes. In order to evaluate the catalytic activity of complexes 4a and 4b in the hydroamination of aryl alkynes with anilines we first did a screening of the general reaction conditions, such as catalyst loading, solvent, temperature and reaction time using the', 'gold complexes are well suited for the electrophilic activation of alkynes and their subsequent functionalization with a variety of nucleophiles. This preference for alkyne activation has been attributed to the low LUMO energies of Au-alkyne complexes, rendering them more electrophilic. Figure . General metal complexes with Buchwald-type ligands (A), related gold complexes from the literature (B, C), and synthetic targets of this study (D).In Au(I) catalysis a major drawback is the decay of the gold catalyst, which results from reduction of the cationic gold center to gold(0). It has been shown that in many of these transformations electron-rich phosphine ligands outperform their electrondeficient counterparts. For the intermolecular amination of alkynes electron-rich phosphines with a 2-biphenyl moiety are considered superior. Comparing the TEP-values of common Buchwald-type phosphines shows that they do not exceed the donor strength of simple t Bu3P, and the prominent class of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are stronger œÉ donor ligands (Figure ). Dielmann and co-workers, as well as Sundermayer et al. have recently pushed the electron-donating ability of phosphines beyond their classical endpoint through P-substitution with N-heterocyclic imines (NHIs) or phosphazenes, respectively. In addition, the NHI-functionalization allows the metal center to engage in additional interaction with the aryl-substituents in the NNHC-position of the carbene', ""to engage in additional interaction with the aryl-substituents in the NNHC-position of the carbene (Figure ).

Two synthetic routes towards terphenyl-substituted bisaminophoshines 1a (R = Me) and 1b (R = Et).Ragogna and co-workers have recently described a route towards Ter-PCl2 through aminolysis of Ter-P(NEt2)2 with dry HCl. Consequently, we prepared Ter-P(NR2)2 [R = Me (1a), Et (1b)] by treatment of isolated Ter-Li with ClP(NR2)2 (R = Me, Et; an HClfree P-source) in toluene at ambient temperature (Scheme 1, reaction 1). In case of 1a, filtration over a celite-padded frit and removal of the solvent resulted in the isolation of an analytically pure colourless so lid in 67% yield. For 1b, after stirring for 1.5 h, the solvent was removed and the residue was extracted with n-hexane, concentrated to incipient crystallization and standing at 5 ¬∞C overnight afforded 1b as an analytically pure colourless crystalline solid, in a moderate yield of 40%. We found that consistently higher yields are obtained by starting from Ter-I. Lithiation of Ter-I with 2.5 M n BuLi (in n-hexane) in Et2O at 0¬∞C and subsequent treatment with ClP(NR2)2 afforded 1a (79 %) and 1b (89 %) in good isolated yields (Scheme 1, reaction 2). In addition, this synthetic approach can be easily scaled and 1b was prepared on a multigram scale.

This stabilizing arene-interaction was further authenticated through an analysis of the electron density of an optimized structure at the wB97XD/6-31g(d,p) level of theory, using the AIM (Atoms in Molecules) approach.

Monitoring of the hydroamination between phenylacetylene and p -toluidine with 2 mol% of 4a or 4b in MeCN at 60¬∞C showed that conversion plateaued after ca. 6 h. We therefore decided to run catalytic reactions overnight (ca. 16 h) to take into account different sterics of the substrates to be used. Variation of the catalyst loading revealed that no significant drop of conversion occurs going from 2 mol% to 1 mol% and minimally worse results were obtained with 0.5 mol%.

These Buchwald-type ligands with flanking mesityl groups have been shown to possess attractive interactions between the gold center and one of the flanking mesityl groups, as was ascertained by determination of the molecular structures of a series of gold complexes 2, 3, 4 and 5.The percent buried volume of 1b amounts to ca. 55% and a linear fit of known TEP-values with their respective gas phase structures (obtained by DFT studies) revealed that particularly 1b can be classified as electron-rich phosphine and their application in the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes was tested. Preparing catalyst solutions by chloride ion abstraction from 2 with AgX salts, sometimes the formation of the respective dimeric Ag-complexes [(L)Ag-¬µ-Cl]2 6a and 6b was noted, which were independently synthesized. This is another example that AgCl contamination can result in erroneous catalyst screening results. Screening of the catalytic reaction conditions showed efficient hydroamination to take place at 60¬∞C in MeCN with a catalyst loading of 4 of 1 mol% and moderate to excellent yields were achieved for bulky anilines such as Dip-NH2 and different phenyl acetylene derivatives. No obvious difference in performance between ligands 1a and 1b was noted. In summary, terphenylbisaminophosphines meet the criteria of efficient ligands for intermolecular gold-catalyzed hydroamination reactions, as they combine strong donor properties with the 2-biphenyl structural motif, which is needed to enhance complex stability during catalysis.', 'It should be noted that the electron-rich alkynes 4-MeO-and 4-t Bu-phenylacetylene could be converted into the respective imines quantitively as determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy, using 1,3,5-OMe3-C6H3 as an internal standard. However, attempts to isolate these electron-rich imines after column chromatography on silica with n-Hex/EtOAc (4:1) as the eluent, resulted in the isolation of the corresponding benzophenone derivatives in good isolated yields (Scheme 3, bottom). The isolated yields for the hydroamination of phenylacetylene are generally good, with up to 97% yield for the reaction with Mes-NH2. Interestingly, for F3C-C6H4-CCH with the yield increases with the steric demand of the respective aniline and up to 92% of the respective Dip -substituted imine were isolated. In general, we observed that the isolated yields are usually over 70% and nearly independent of whether 1a or 1b were used as a ligand. In summary, ligands of the type 1 represent a potent class of electron rich Buchwald-type phosphines, which have proven to be efficient in stabilizing Au(I) complexes for the intramolecular hydroamination of alkynes.', 'Results and discussionScheme 1. Two synthetic routes towards terphenyl-substituted bisaminophoshines 1a (R = Me) and 1b (R = Et).Ragogna and co-workers have recently described a route towards Ter-PCl2 through aminolysis of Ter-P(NEt2)2 with dry HCl. Consequently, we prepared Ter-P(NR2)2 [R = Me (1a), Et (1b)] by treatment of isolated Ter-Li with ClP(NR2)2 (R = Me, Et; an HClfree P-source) in toluene at ambient temperature (Scheme 1, reaction 1). In case of 1a, filtration over a celite-padded frit and removal of the solvent resulted in the isolation of an analytically pure colourless so lid in 67% yield. For 1b, after stirring for 1.5 h, the solvent was removed and the residue was extracted with n-hexane, concentrated to incipient crystallization and standing at 5 ¬∞C overnight afforded 1b as an analytically pure colourless crystalline solid, in a moderate yield of 40%. We found that consistently higher yields are obtained by starting from Ter-I. Lithiation of Ter-I with 2.5 M n BuLi (in n-hexane) in Et2O at 0¬∞C and subsequent treatment with ClP(NR2)2 afforded 1a (79 %) and 1b (89 %) in good isolated yields (Scheme 1, reaction 2). In addition, this synthetic approach can be easily scaled and 1b was prepared on a multigram scale. Ligands 1a and 1b are characterized by 31 P NMR signals at 102.5 and 100.2 ppm, respectively, upfield-shifted compared to their respective ClP(NR2)2 precursors. In the 1 H NMR spectrum of 1a and 1b two signals for the ortho and para CH3-groups of the mesityl groups in a 2:1 ratio are observed. In 1a a doublet corresponding to the two NMe2 groups is detected, indicating C2 symmetry in solution.

Terphenyl-groups, of the general formula 2,6-Ar2-C6H3, have played a leading role in advancing the chemistry of low-valent main group and transition metal species. A reagent commonly used to introduce the terphenyl moiety is Ter-Li (Ter = 2,6-Mes2-C6H3), which can be treated with element halides to access Ter-EXn species. In our hands treatment of Ter-Li with PCl3 often resulted in trace amounts of Ter-H contaminating the desired Ter-PCl2 product. Thus, we were interested in a way to circumvent the formation of Ter-H. Ragogna et al. have recently described the successful preparation of [TerPS]2, a source of monomeric phosphinidine sulfides. [TerPS]2 is synthesized by treating Ter-PCl2 with S(SiMe3)2.

Finally, we applied the photochromic CID system for the optical manipulation of biomolecular networks in live cells. The autophagy-mediated degradation of mitochondria, termed mitophagy, is an essential intracellular event for maintaining cellular homeostasis, in which damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria are degraded in lysosomes . The PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated pathway plays a crucial role in the removal of damaged mitochondria among several mechanisms. PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of damaged mitochondria, is autophosphorylated, and phosphorylates ubiquitin, followed by recruitment and activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to induce mitophagy . While the conventional CID system allows PINK1 to be recruited to the MOM, followed by mitophagy induction , it is challenging to spatiotemporally regulate PINK1 recruitment to']","['Biomedical engineering and technology', 'Regenerative medicine']",346,1,1,0,0.95288507,1.11E-16,['why']

The most obvious difference between the four spectra is the lower intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra of the cell on the soft PA gel attached to the custom substrate. Because this feature is absent in the spectra of the stiff PA gel on a custom substrate, it is not likely due to either the custom substrate itself or to differences in the reagents used to attach the photopolymerized and thermally polymerized gels to the custom substrate and commercial substrate, respectively. Instead, we attribute the low intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra acquired from the soft PA gel on the custom substrate to a low degree of polymerization within this gel. This interpretation is supported by our observation that the intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 increases with the UV exposure time (Figure .b), and prior reports that assign the spectral peaks at 830-850 cm -1 to polyacrylamide .Comparison of the average spectra acquired from cells on each combination of PA gel stiffness and substrate (Figure .b) reveals the spectra acquired from both the custom substrate and the commercially available (Thorlabs) substrate are roughly comparable. However, the average spectra from CHO cells on the custom substrate have higher standard deviation.Because photopolymerization produces gels with a larger range of stiffness than thermal polymerization, this higher variance is due to the use of photopolymerization to create the PA gels on the custom substrates and thermal polymerization to create the PA gels on the substrates purchased from Thorlabs.

The thickness of each layer was monitored during deposition with a quartz crystal thickness monitor. These layer thicknesses were validated by using X-ray reflectivity, and good agreement was found (Figure ).

We employed cells from the CHO and CHO-T cell lines because they are very closely related, so we expected their spectra would be as similar to one another as those from primary HSCs and their progeny. The spectra were preprocessed by taking the second derivative of the spectra, and then performing normalization and mean centering to reduce, but not eliminate the peaks in the Raman spectra of the living cells that were produced by the gels. Because PLS-DA uses spectral features that vary between, but not within each class for identification, we used a calibration set that contained an equal number of spectra for every combination of cell type and gel stiffness (24 spectra/cell type, 12 on soft and 12 on stiff gels) for PLS-DA model construction.The resulting model consisted of 4 latent variables that captured 84.90% of the total variation in the calibration set, and it was applied to an independent (test) set of 26 spectra of cells from each line.

"to spectra acquired from CHO cells on soft and stiff functionalized PA gels on the commercial substrates from Thorlabs (Figure .a). The most obvious difference between the four spectra is the lower intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra of the cell on the soft PA gel attached to the custom substrate. Because this feature is absent in the spectra of the stiff PA gel on a custom substrate, it is not likely due to either the custom substrate itself or to differences in the reagents used to attach the photopolymerized and thermally polymerized gels to the custom substrate and commercial substrate, respectively. Instead, we attribute the low intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 in the spectra acquired from the soft PA gel on the custom substrate to a low degree of polymerization within this gel. This interpretation is supported by our observation that the intensity of the broad peak at 850 cm -1 increases with the UV exposure time (Figure .b), and prior reports that assign the spectral peaks at 830-850 cm -1 to polyacrylamide .Comparison of the average spectra acquired from cells on each combination of PA gel stiffness and substrate (Figure .b) reveals the spectra acquired from both the custom substrate and the commercially available (Thorlabs) substrate are roughly comparable. However, the average spectra from CHO cells on the custom substrate have higher standard deviation.Because photopolymerization produces gels with a larger range of stiffness than thermal polymerization, this higher variance is due to the use of photopolymerization to create the PA gels on the custom substrates and thermal polymerization to create the PA gels on the substrates purchased from Thorlabs.

"Synthesis of Multi-Protein Complexes through Charge-Directed Sequential Activation of Tyrosine Residues Site-selective protein-protein coupling has long been a goal of chemical biology research. In recent years, that goal has been realized to varying degrees through a number of techniques, including the use of tyrosinase-based coupling strategies. Early publications utilizing tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus showed the potential to convert tyrosine residues into ortho-quinone functional groups, but this enzyme is challenging to produce recombinantly and suffers from some limitations in substrate scope. Initial screens of several tyrosinase candidates revealed that the tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium (megaTYR) as an enzyme that possesses a broad substrate tolerance.We use the expanded substrate preference as a starting point for protein design experiments and show that single point mutants of megaTYR are capable of activating tyrosine residues in various sequence contexts.

Generating sequence orthogonal tyrosinases could enable the facile creation of complex multi-domain proteins by coupling anionic and cationic tagged subunits sequentially. This could be done in a manner similar to peptide synthesis but using entire proteins as building blocks. The controlled production of multi-protein polymers could be an enabling technology for protein based materials, biomedical technologies, and enzyme engineering. Although the megaTYR mutants to date were not fully prevented from acting on cationic substrates, the range in selectivity between abTYR and D55R megaTYR proved a tantalizing target. To test this, the cysteine-containing Y200C sfGFP was modified with EEEEY and RRRRY C-terminal tags, which should be unreactive with abTYR, and D55R megaTYR, respectively (Figure , S4). After purification, the Y200C sfGFP-EEEEY (GFP-E4Y) was exposed to abTYR for 30 min in a variety of conditions. Notably, the mushroom tyrosinase was able to append GGGGY and RRRRY peptides to the GFP-E4Y without oxidizing the EEEEY tag. In addition, exposing the GFP-E4Y to abTYR resulted in no discernable oxidation by ESI-MS. This aligns with our previous peptide screens, and suggests that the EEEEY tag is not succeptible to abTYR activation (Figure ). Similarly, Y200C sfGFP-RRRRY (GFP-R4Y) was exposed to D55R megaTYR under similar conditions, with the EEEEY peptide used in place of the RRRRY peptide. Similarly to abTYR, D55R megaTYR was able to selectively oxidize the added peptides without modifying the tyrosine tag on the GFP-R4Y. Reaction selectivity was further confirmed when exposure of GFP-R4Y to D55R megaTYR alone did not result in any oxidation (Figure ). Together these data suggest that abTYR and D55R megaTYR can be used for CDSAT on proteins and peptides.To further validate reaction orthogonality we', '). We reasoned that this was likely the high degree of negative charge on the nucleotide substrate.We next examined the substrate preference of the new tyrosinases, specifically with respect to their charge and steric tolerance. A peptide library with tyrosine residues at their C-termini was obtained, shown in Supplemental Table , which contained a variety of charged and neutral sequence elements. The peptides were coupled to Y200C GFP in 30 min reactions and analyzed via ESI-TOF MS to determine conversion to the modified peptide-protein conjugate. To ensure that peptide coupling was not biased by electrostatic interactions between GFP (pI = 6.2) and the peptides, control reactions were run on a p-aminophenylalanine modified MS2 capsid, which has a pI of 8.0. These reactions reached similar levels of modification (Supplemental Figure ). Comparing abTYR to the non-eukaryotic tyrosinases, it is readily apparent that abTYR is significantly more sensitive to negative charge (Figure ). In fact, abTYR shows no activity towards any peptide with 4 or more acidic residues adjacent to the terminal tyrosine. Also of note is the fact that megaTYR shows high activity towards all peptide substrates, with a drop in activity only in the case of the RRRRY peptide. These results supported the earlier challenge activating ssDNA substrates using abTYR, and suggest that megaTYR may serve as a highly permissive tyrosine activator.One additional observation of this study was that cnkTyr samples showed no discernable pattern of substrate specificity. The structures of the three tyrosinases were compared to determine the origin of their selectivities, with cnkTyr represented by a homology model created using the I-TASSER server., <ref type=""bibr""', 'ConclusionHere we show that recombinantly expressed tyrosinases are successful activators of terminal tyrosine residues on a variety of protein and peptide substrates. The results from the megaTYR mutant screen show that bacterially derived tyrosinases possess sufficient selectivity to mediate protein-protein coupling reactions through tyrosine-cysteine bond formation, and can be engineered to alter their substrate preferences. The success at modulating the charge preference of this enzyme indicates that it is tolerant toward mutation and can be engineered to achieve orthogonal reactivity preferences to those of abTYR. The result of these efforts is the ability to sequentially activate tyrosine residues based on their charge context, or CDSAT. The protein trimers created using CDSAT show that minimal engineering is required to produce a system capable of creating higher-order protein constructs.

Integration of an unmodified protein sample served as an internal standard for determining conversion.', 'Results and discussionIn our search for more sequence permissive enzymes we identified tyrosinases from Bacillus megaterium (megaTYR) and Candidatus Nitrosopumilus koreensis (cnkTYR) as optimal candidates for recombinant expression. In particular, megaTYR was selected because several previous studies showed that the enzyme tolerated point mutations while retaining high activity to free tyrosine. The published crystal structures for megaTYR were beneficial for protein engineering, as they allowed rational design of point mutants and facilitated computational analysis of the protein (Figure ). In addition, cnkTYR was recently shown to have excellent monophenol monooxygenase activity and to tolerate low temperatures without significant loss in catalytic efficiency. In addition to the previously published work on protein L, the motivation for these explorations was the realization that abTYR was incapable of activating phenols attached to a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrate. In contrast, our first experiment with megaTYR showed significant levels of coupling between GFP and the phenol-DNA (Figure ). This reaction occurs as two distinct steps: the initial activation of the phenol to the orthoquinone followed by addition of the nucleophile. These results suggested that some aspect of the DNA substrate was preventing activation by abTYR but was tolerated by megaTYR (Figure ). We reasoned that this was likely the high degree of', 'which expands the possible sites of enzymatic protein-protein bioconjugation past the N-and C-termini. This methodology is versatile, and can take place at temperatures ranging from 4 ¬∞C to room temperature and near-neutral pH, to preserve the function of sensitive proteins. Despite the recent success and convenience of abTYR, it is not without limitations. In a recent investigation, abTYR was unable to activate tyrosine residues at the C terminus of protein L, regardless of linker length. Both abTYR and protein L are over 100 kDa in mass, and are negatively charged, suggesting that electrostatic repulsion and steric hinderance may be the factors preventing the activation of this particular substrate by abTYR. A smaller, 35.5 kDa tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium (megaTYR, referred to as bmTYR in ref 17), was found to activate C-terminal tyrosines on protein L regardless of linker length. In this study we characterize the substrate preferences of these tyrosinases, and show that abTYR is unable to oxidize tyrosines in negatively charged substrates, whereas megaTYR, and the recently reported tyrosinase from the archaeon, Candidatus Nitrosopumilus koreensis (cnk-TYR), are much more promiscuous. In this report, we use this information to generate new versions of megaTYR selective for tyrosine residues in specific charge contexts.

We reasoned that surface exposed polar and ionic residues proximal to the active site may be attractive targets, as they would have larger effects on active site potential than more distal residues, and modeled them in a similar manner (Table ).

When the full active complex of abTYR is considered the net potential drops to -15.7 V.

"understood. Beyond phase change behaviour, dynamic ML bonding in MOFs helps to explain otherwise difficult to understand phenomena. For example, the ability of MOFs to undergo replacement of their metal and linker components, commonly termed ""post-synthetic exchange"", challenges the idea of static ML bonds. Similarly, dynamic bonding would help explain the ability of MOFs to perform catalysis at ostensibly coordinatively saturated metal sites and to melt into liquid MOFs. Whereas all semiconductors exhibit redshifting optical gaps at increased temperatures in a manner termed ""Varshni behaviour"", MOF optical gaps exhibit a far greater temperature dependence explainable by dynamic bonding. This perspective, rooted in coordination chemistry, also reveals previously unnoticed aspects of MOF materials. Specifically, recent evidence indicates that MOF ML bonds become more labile for smaller MOF particle sizes. This insight implies that all MOF properties dependent on metal-ligand interactions may be tuned through particle size. Therefore, dynamic ML bonding provides a lens to see deeper into fundamental aspects of MOF chemistry, providing a tool for greater synthetic control over their performance while also uncovering behaviour distinct among any class of molecules or materials.",Causal,How does dynamic ML bonding in MOFs explain the phenomenon of post-synthetic exchange and the ability of MOFs to perform catalysis?,Answer not available from the given context. ,Negative,"['Beyond phase change behaviour, dynamic ML bonding in MOFs helps to explain otherwise difficult to understand phenomena.

Despite ample evidence of bond lability in molecular and polymeric coordination compounds, the metal-linker bonds of MOFs were long assumed to be rigid and static. Given the importance of ligand fields in determining the behaviour of metal species, labile bonding in MOFs would help explain outstanding questions about MOF behaviour, while providing a design tool for controlling dynamic and stimuli-responsive optoelectronic, magnetic, catalytic, and mechanical phenomena. Here, we present emerging evidence that MOF metal-linker bonds exist in dynamic equilibria between weakly and tightly bond conformations, and that these equilibria respond to guest-host chemistry, drive phase change behavior, and exhibit size-dependence in MOF nanoparticles.Metal-ligand (ML) bonds dictate the properties of metal complexes and coordination materials. Subtle differences in the geometries and energetics of ligand fields surrounding metal ions govern the optical, electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties and overall stability of the resulting complexes. While enthalpy favours ML bond formation, entropy drives their dissociation such that all ML bonds exist to varying degrees in dynamic equilibria between bound and unbound states. This bond lability impacts the mechanisms of transition metal catalysis 4-6 and enables the self-healing behaviour observed in coordination polymers. 7-10 Among traditional solid-state materials, the earliest examples of ferroelectric phase-change behaviour were documented to involve a special class of ML phonons, 11-13 now termed soft modes. In other words, dynamic equilibria of metal-ligand bonds exist in coordination complexes ranging', 'In other words, dynamic equilibria of metal-ligand bonds exist in coordination complexes ranging from small molecules to extended solids, and yet dynamic bonding in materials bridging the gap between the molecular and solid-state divide remains an open frontier. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), also termed 3D porous coordination polymers, are a compositionally tuneable class of materials. Their secondary building units (SBUs) can be altered to yield either isostructural or entirely new materials. To date, nearly 100,000 MOFs have been synthesized and over 500,000 structures have been predicted, all of which contain ML bonds. Considering the fundamental lability of ML bonds, it follows that MOFs and other CPs should also exhibit similar behaviour to molecules and nonporous solids. While many early reports of MOFs document phase-change behaviour, soft mode behaviour was only introduced into the MOF literature recently. In this Frontier article we will highlight recent studies of dynamic ML bonds and their implications for the future of the MOF field. The tension between enthalpically and entropically favoured ML bond conformations gives rise to a generic one-dimensional configurational coordinate diagram shown in Fig. . This free energy landscape tends towards bound ML states at low Fig. (a) Schematic view of metal-ligand interactions, where ""tight"" and ""loose"" bond states exist in thermodynamic equilibrium. Inserts show a metal-carboxylate interaction. (b) Illustration of the energy landscape for ensembles of ""tight"" and ""loose"" states of metal-ligand interactions and how the equilibrium may be', 'conformations for this family of materials, electronic structure calculations predicted a large ensemble of thermodynamically stable geometries that existed within thermal energy of each other despite possessing bond lengths that differed by as much as 0.1 √Ö. Importantly, these same methods predicted the phase change \uf044H for both the Fe and Cu variants with remarkable accuracy as compared with experimental calorimetry. Together, these results suggest that if a MOF has the potential for a phase change due to electronic aspects specific to the metal ion, the dynamic ML bonding intrinsic to MOFs serve as the soft mode. For example, in the case of SCO, where ML bonds transition from short and strong low-spin states to long and weak high-spin bonds, the ""tight""-""loose"" equilibrium is well suited to shuttle the material from one phase to the other. Dynamic ML bonds also affect the electronic structures of MOFs by perturbing the ligand field of the metal sites. Early evidence of this effect was observed by VT diffuse-reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy (VT-DRUVVis) of MUV-10(Ca), Ti3Ca3(Œº3-O)2(1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate)4(H2O)6. Upon heating the material, absorption tails emerged as far as 2.0 eV below the low-temperature optical gap. Despite such a large effect, these tails disappeared upon cooling, thereby ruling out irreversible thermal degradation. Instead, the absorption tailing suggests reversible structural distortions around the MOF nodes that dynamically lower the symmetry of the metal sites, creating mid-gap states. Analogously, vibronic coupling dynamically lowers the symmetry of molecular inorganic complexes. As a result, they display colour from formally forbidden optical transitions. Guest molecules also influence the dynamic equilibria of MOF ML bonding. Whereas the above report studied MOFs under vacuum, VT-DRIFTS spectra were reported for UiO-66 (Zr6O4OH4(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)6)-a MOF known for its unusual', 'Dynamic bonding in MOF nanoparticlesNanosizing MOFs causes ML bonding to become more labile. As a result, MOF properties sensitive to ML interactions have the potential to become size-dependent. Recent evidence was documented in a report on the temperature dependence of archetypical MOFs with particle sizes ranging from 20 nm -4 ¬µm. As determined by VT-DRUVVis, all materials displayed decreasing optical gaps with increasing temperatures. Although conventional semiconductors typically show this ""Varshni behaviour"", the effect in MOFs was much more severe. For TiO2, Si, and similar materials, optical gaps decrease by roughly 0.1 eV over a 300 K range, whereas the MOF nanoparticles (nanoMOFs) absorbed at photon energies nearly 1 eV below the original low-temperature optical gap. The magnitude of this effect depends on the lability of the MOF ML bonds, however. As an example, the relatively dynamic titanium-carboxylate bonds in MIL-125 (Ti8O8(OH)4(terephthalate)6) led to a large but reversible decrease of ~600 mV over a range of 300 K, whereas ZIF-8 (Zn(2-methylimidazolate)2), comprised of strong zinc-imidazolate bonds, shows a much smaller decrease of only ~10 mV.

For example, magnetic spin crossover (SCO) arises from this stimulus-responsive ML bond interaction. Lower temperatures favour strong and short low-spin ML bonds, while high temperatures favour high-spin ML bonds. SCO represents an example of dynamic bonding in a phase change, which, by definition, constitutes a reversible equilibrium property. Although MOFs have been reported as phase-change materials, the underlying mechanism that makes certain MOFs susceptible to phase changes remains poorly understood. Based on the lack of investigations into MOF ML bond dynamics, we expect that phase-change behaviour represents just the beginning of MOF properties explainable by labile bonding. From melting to magnetic and structural phase transitions, soft modes serve as the conduit for one material to transform into another. By distorting atomic positions sufficiently far from equilibrium geometries, soft modes impart their kinetic energy to the surrounding lattice as anharmonically coupled oscillators. As a result, such lattice vibrations exhibit red-shifting frequencies as temperatures approach the critical transition temperatures. Beyond the proposal that MOFs exist in a two-state bond equilibrium, certain dynamic bonds might fulfil the role of soft modes by serving as the mechanism for phase change behaviour. This Frontier discusses recent evidence that ML bond vibrations in MOFs behave as soft modes in cases where the phase change involves a change to the ligand sphere.

Given that metal-ligand vibrations occur at the low-frequency limit of common infrared spectrometers and the often-low signal intensities of Raman spectra, synchrotron techniques would likely be required to probe them in MOFs. Indeed, terahertz-based synchrotron measurements have been employed to study ligand-related dynamics in ""breathing"" carboxylate MOFs and the melting behaviour of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). As an alternative, VT midinfrared vibrational spectroscopy provides a convenient method for tracking dynamic ML MOF bonds using conventional benchtop equipment. Fig. schematically depicts the justification for this strategy. Specifically, the carboxylate vibrational modes typical of most MOFs serve as a trackable spectroscopic handle during VT-diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (VT-DRIFTS), made possible by the fact that the ML and carboxylate bonds act as coupled oscillators. To develop VT vibrational spectroscopy as a handle for probing MOF ML dynamics, however, the temperaturedependent spectral changes must be attributable to a microscopic model of bound and unbound states. From the perspective of molecular orbital theory, the ligand-based electrons bound to metal sites also occupy anti-and non-bonding orbitals with respect to the ligand.

Evidence for dynamic ML bond equilibria in MOFs was recently reported as VT-DRIFTS spectra for a series of archetypical carboxylate MOFs. The observed red-shift in the vibrational frequencies of the symmetric and asymmetric C-O stretches suggested the coexistence of ""tight"" and ""loose"" states in thermal equilibrium. This nomenclature was adopted over ""bound"" and ""unbound"" because previously reported molecular dynamics simulations 26 revealed that MOF ML bonds dynamically fluctuate between conformations with a wide range of bond lengths and angles. Accordingly, carboxylate MOFs were interpreted to exist in an equilibrium between two shallow and wide potential energy surfaces that encompass of diverse collections of tightly or loosely bound ML states. The relative abundances of the ""tight"" and ""loose"" states can be extracted by fitting two fixed Gaussians to these data at different temperatures, permitting quantification of a ""flexibility"" constant (ln Kflex, Kflex = [loose]/[tight]), defined as the inverse of the familiar formation constants Kf reported for molecular complexes. In HKUST-1 (Fig. and), an ln Kflex of ~0.3 was observed at room temperature, which compares well to values reported for discrete metal complexes such as zinc and copper benzoates/acetates in the range of 0.1-1.5. This analysis also suggests that unbound states likely comprise a significant portion of MOF structures. To gain insight into the thermodynamics of this equilibrium, Van\'t Hoff analysis of VT-DRIFTS data of HKUST-1 was performed to assess the temperature dependence of Kflex. This result suggests that the population of loose states is associated with a small endothermic barrier (ŒîH = 5.9 ¬± 0.2 kJ mol -1 ), overcome by an increase in entropy (ŒîS = 22.0 ¬± 0.6 J mol -1', 'Dynamic bonding and soft modesIn the MOF literature, ""structural dynamics"" typically refers to ""breathing effects"", the transient binding of guest molecules, and negative thermal expansion, rather than ML bond dynamics. And while reversible ML bonding is attributed a key role in MOF crystallization, it is often overlooked when studying the resulting materials. As a result, little evidence attests to ML dynamics in MOFs. Whereas labile ML bonding is invoked to explain a range of molecular coordination chemistry, few studies have documented dynamic bonding in 3D materials. In a close analogy to MOFs, however, metalligand lability has been studied for 1D coordination polymers to such an extent that the equilibrium ratio of unbound-tobound states, termed the formation constants Kf, have been documented for a range of metal ligand bonds, including metalcarbene, metal-pyridyl, and metal-carboxylate bonds. These studies probe ML bond lability by measuring relative concentrations of unbound and bound ML states, but few studies have investigated the ML bonds themselves. In one example, variable temperature (VT) Raman spectra were reported for a metallopolymer containing metal-pyridyl linkages.

Together, these results suggest that if a MOF has the potential for a phase change due to electronic aspects specific to the metal ion, the dynamic ML bonding intrinsic to MOFs serve as the soft mode. For example, in the case of SCO, where ML bonds transition from short and strong low-spin states to long and weak high-spin bonds, the ""tight""-""loose"" equilibrium is well suited to shuttle the material from one phase to the other.

"Dynamic bonding in MOF nanoparticlesNanosizing MOFs causes ML bonding to become more labile. As a result, MOF properties sensitive to ML interactions have the potential to become size-dependent. Recent evidence was documented in a report on the temperature dependence of archetypical MOFs with particle sizes ranging from 20 nm -4 ¬µm.

Size-dependent thermal shifts to optical gaps in nanoMOFs involves bond dynamics beyond the explanation typically given for ""Varshni behaviour"". In conventional semiconductors, thermal shifts arise from elongation and contraction of lattice parameters with changes to thermal energy.

From Figure (c), we find x in Al that effective temperatures of 3000-4000 K are needed to metastabilize Al 1-x Gd x N compositions with x > 0.3. Such high effective temperatures can be achieved only with nonequilibrium growth e.g., by bombardment of highly energetic atoms/ions (sputtering).

We have performed a joint computational and experimental study on the incorporation of Gd 3+ into AlN, creating a heterostructural alloy Al 1-x Gd x N between rocksalt GdN and wurtzite AlN. First-principles calculations using density functional theory in conjunction with SQS supercells reveal that the critical composition for a wurtzite to rocksalt phase transition is x c = 0.82. The calculated mixing free energy indicates that at equilibrium conditions and at temperatures below 1000 K, there is a large miscibility gap and only a few percent of Gd can be incorporated in AlN. Higher (effective) temperatures that can be accessed with non-equilibrium growth methods will enable higher Gd incorporation.

Here, we describe a method for super-resolution imaging of metabolically labeled phospholipids within cellular membranes. Guided by the principles of expansion microscopy, we develop an approach featuring cell-permeable reagents that enables direct chemical anchoring of bioorthogonally labeled phospholipids into a hydrogel network and is capable of tunable, isotropic expansion, thus facilitating super-resolution imaging of cellular membranes. We apply this method, termed lipid expansion microscopy, to visualize organelle membranes with precision, including a unique class of membrane-bound structures known as nuclear invaginations. As it is compatible with standard confocal microscopes, lipid expansion microscopy will be widely applicable for super-resolution imaging of phospholipids and cellular membranes in numerous physiological contexts.', 'fluorophore for imaging pre-and post-LExM, and (iii) a methacrylamide polymerizable unit for direct incorporation into the hydrogel network. We validated that 1 is membranepermeable and capable of imaging bioorthogonally labeled lipids by confocal microscopy imaging of HeLa cells tagged with 1 after treatment with propargylcholine (ProCho), an alkynyl analog of choline that is metabolically incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (PC) and other cholinecontaining lipids (Figure ). We observed a strong fluorescent signal from many intracellular membranes, consistent with the broad distribution of PC in mammalian cells (Figure ). Importantly, the signal was ProCho-dependent, indicating that 1 is specific for alkyne-labeled phospholipids (Figure ).A key feature of ExM is isotropic sample expansion, which is achieved by disrupting membranes with permeabilization to enable uniform diffusion of polymerization reagents throughout the sample. This step is critical for incorporation of ionic monomers needed for the final osmotic expansion step, and for streptavidin-based anchoring strategies where such macromolecular fluorescent labeling reagents are membrane-impermeable. To ensure that monomers are evenly distributed in LExM, we used uncharged, membrane-permeable monomers that are hydrolyzed, post-polymerization, to yield ionic residues necessary for expansion. Our optimized LExM protocol involves metabolic labeling of cells with ProCho, fixation, fluorescent tagging with 1 via CuAAC, polymerization in the presence of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomers, denaturation and hydrolysis, and finally expansion,', 'more general strategy for ExM-based imaging of alkyne-labeled lipids, we subjected cells to IMPACT labeling with the PLD substrate hexynol, CuAAC tagging with 1, and the LExM protocol. Consistent with the ProCho-based LExM studies, IMPACT labeling generated samples with a 5.6x expansion factor (at the 4 h hydrolysis timepoint) and fluorescence signal that correlated well with the pre-LExM image (Figure ). The enhanced resolution of the post-LExM image also enabled identification of distinct membranes in crowded areas, e.g., the nuclear envelope (Figure ). Samples generated with IMPACT were similarly obtained in a tunable manner with isotropic expansion and were amenable to colocalization studies with organelle markers (Figures ). Importantly, treatment with a pan-PLD inhibitor prevented fluorescent labeling in pre-LExM images (Figure ). Finally, we applied LExM to study specific sub-diffraction scale cellular structures.Metabolic labeling of phospholipids revealed channels that traverse nuclei, which we hypothesized were a unique class of structures known as nuclear invaginations (Video S1). These channels, comprised of nuclear membrane surrounded by lamina that envelop cytoplasmic contents, can travel through nuclei. Because of their narrow dimensions, their detailed analysis has been limited to electron microscopy and traditional super-resolution microscopy (e.g., STED/SMLM). To visualize these membrane-bound structures with ExM, we labeled cells expressing a nuclear lamina marker with ProCho and performed the LExM protocol. Inspection of post-ExM', ' Alternatively, metabolic labeling of native phospholipids has also been leveraged for expansion of membranes using click-ExM, which anchors lipids to the hydrogel network through a biotin-streptavidin conjugation. Notably, these methods require at least mild permeabilization of the membrane, which can compromise its integrity and potentially alter its structure, to ensure a uniform distribution of ExM reagents and isotropic expansion of samples.We were motivated by a desire to visualize lipids using ExM with molecular detail while preserving the structural integrity of the membranes. Here, we present an approach involving metabolic labeling of natural phospholipids, a trifunctional fluorophore for the tagging and tethering of lipids to the hydrogel, and membrane-permeable expansion reagents (Figure ). This method, termed Lipid Expansion Microscopy (LExM), allows for the tunable and isotropic expansion of membranes through direct anchoring of phospholipids into the polymer network without permeabilization. We demonstrate that LExM is a general method for the expansion of metabolically labeled lipids to enable super-resolution imaging of organelle membranes, and we apply LExM to visualize sub-diffraction scale invaginations of the nuclear membrane and their membrane-bound cytoplasmic contents. To incorporate phospholipids directly into the hydrogel network, we designed and prepared trifunctional LExM reagent 1 (Figure ), which is equipped with (i) an azido group for tagging alkyne-labeled biomolecules via Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), (ii) a BODIPY fluorophore for imaging pre-and post-LExM, and (iii) a methacrylamide polymerizable unit for direct', 'limit of light.

Jortner and coworkers', 'oxidized and the reduced partner during ET, and the effect of anharmonicity.

The model predicted both normal and inverse KIE depending upon the frequency shifts and the displaced potential energy surfaces of the reacting components.Realizing that some of the thiols (~ 30%) stay protonated in these SAMs and are likely strongly H-bonded to their neighbouring thiolates as indicated by a very weak -SH stretch at 2155 cm -1 relative to 2550 cm -1 in free thiols, the KIE observed here can originate from one of the many possible normal modes at the interface that may be displaced during ET. In particular, very large (>200 cm -1 ) normal H/D isotope effects were observed for C-S-H bending modes and large inverse (10-30 cm -1 ) H/D isotope effects were observed on the C-S stretching modes (both Gauche and Trans). Observation of such strong coupling between these modes and very weak S-H vibration suggests that the thiols at the interface are likely strongly hydrogen bonded to the neighbouring thiolates. It is conceivable that these modes change during electron transfer. Of course, this requires the ET from the electrode to be localized at these Au-SAM units.

The standard deviation of the charge distribution across the ensemble is just 0.02 e, supporting previous observations that the underlying DDEC atoms-in-molecule charges are relatively independent of conformation. It is important to test whether these system-specific force field parameters translate into more accurate protein interactions and dynamics. In this regard, although the conformational preferences of the peptides tested in the previous section are promising, it is not known whether the torsional parameters will continue to be appropriate for use with proteins. As the non-bonded parameters vary with the system studied, the transferability of torsional parameters cannot be readily assumed. To assess this we begin by studying MD simulations of the proteins ubiquitin and GB3.The J coupling errors for ubiquitin and GB3 are summarized in Table . With an overall RMSE of 1.54 Hz, the error using the QUBE force field for ubiquitin is higher than that of OPLS-AA/M, which has an RMSE of 1.12 Hz, but lower than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L with errors of 1.84 Hz and 1.70 Hz respectively. 1 GB3 follows the same trend with an RMSE of 1.10 Hz for the QUBE force field, compared to the error for OPLS-AA/M of 0.90 Hz, whilst OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L both have an error of 1.46 Hz. 1 The J coupling results suggest that whilst the transfer of torsional parameters from dipeptides to proteins may cause some issues, the QUBE force field remains more accurate than OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L. This is promising when we consider that OPLS has been in development for many years with multiple iterations and parameter adjustments performed.The 3 J(H Œ± , H Œ≤ ) coupling term is the main contributor to the J coupling', 'This is similar to the conformational propensity observed for OPLS-AA/M (53.5 ¬± 0.2 %).

The lighter regions correspond to low probability areas including conformations that are not sampled during the simulation.The problems associated with using the Karplus parameters for Gly 3 are discussed in Section S9 of the Supporting Information and elsewhere. Therefore, we evaluate the backbone conformations of Gly 3 through its œÜ/œà distribution alone. In Figure , the OPLS-AA/M backbone conformational distribution is compared to that obtained using the QUBE force field. A lower Œ±-helical population is occupied by the QUBE force field, but otherwise both distributions are very similar.The MD simulations presented here have demonstrated that the QUBE force field, and the parameterization methods used to create it, are sufficiently accurate to recreate conformational propensities of short, flexible peptides. The errors in the simulated dynamics of these molecules are comparable to OPLS-AA/M, and the œÜ/œà distributions demonstrate that the major conformations observed in protein structures are populated. Issues with the transferability of torsional parameters have already been identified from the longer peptide simulations, and are solved by applying regularization. In the following subsection, the performance of QUBE for entire proteins is evaluated to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the methodology to macromolecules and to further understand the', 'of the proteins generally remained close to the experimental structures, but the Œ≤-sheets exhibited greater loss of structure, and regions with no clear structure or exhibiting a turn regularly deviated from the starting structure.These regions also contributed greatest to J coupling errors. Despite this, the majority of the regions in the proteins retained their experimental structure and the J coupling errors for GB3 and ubiquitin were below those of OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L, two force fields regularly used in biomolecular modelling studies.Whilst developing QUBE, manual adjustments to some torsional parameters were required. This was also required in the development of OPLS-AA/M, and we can infer from this that automatically fitting backbone and sidechain torsional parameters using dihedral energy scans is still challenging. The most obvious failure of dihedral energy scan fitting was that for a number of sidechains it was more accurate to set the torsional parameters to zero than to use the originally derived terms. This is in part due to the functional form used, with potential improvements to this discussed below, but is also due to the poor sampling of relevant structures by scanning one or two dihedral angles at a time. This problem is reduced by the iterative fitting methods used in AMBER ff14ipq and ff15ipq, 2,38 which sample the structures used for torsional parameter fitting by performing MD simulations with the current iteration of the force field. This approach will be considered in future versions of the force field.Another potential source of error is the choice of modified Seminario method for derivation of bond and angle force constants. However, this method has been shown to accurately reproduce QM vibrational frequencies, and importantly also reproduce QM intramolecular potential energy surfaces of drug-like molecules when combined with the QUBE non-bonded and torsion parameters. <ref', 'performed.The 3 J(H Œ± , H Œ≤ ) coupling term is the main contributor to the J coupling error. For GB3, the 3 J(H Œ± , H Œ≤ ) error for the QUBE force field is 1.80 Hz, this is well below the errors for OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L of 3.71 Hz and 3.38 Hz respectively.However, as discussed in Section S9 of the Supporting Information, the J coupling error should not be used as the only measure of force field accuracy. To further test the performance of the QUBE force field, we compared the œÜ/œà torsion angle distributions and root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone C Œ± atoms of each residue from the experimental crystal structure for five proteins (Section S7 of the Supporting Information).The dihedral angles of the experimental structure are shown on each œÜ/œà plot and these experimental points, along with the previous data for AMBER ff15ipq (the œÜ/œà plots are given in the Supporting Information of Ref. 2) are used to evaluate the performance of the force field. Figure shows the five proteins tested, with the residue labels indicating the main regions that deviated from the crystal structure during simulation.Figure shows the average RMSD of the C Œ± atoms of the five proteins from the experi- The œÜ/œà distributions of GB3 (Figure ) and the RMSD per residue (Figure ) help us to further analyze the results. Residues which deviate from the experimental structure, and the results from the AMBER ff15ipq force field, also tend to have high J coupling errors.For example, residues 8-21 have a large deviation from the experimental structure and this is reflected by high J coupling errors in this region. The backbone J coupling error, using the 2007 Karplus parameters, for residues 8-21 is 2.00 Hz which is almost double the total backbone error. This region corresponds to a Œ≤-sheet, which', ' shows that no dipeptides have populations consisting of just one type of rotamer and there are no extremely high values (as was observed for OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L 1 ). The rotamer M populations are occasionally slightly lower than expected. However, given the issues previously mentioned with the experimental data used, further changes were not made to adjust the outliers.The rotamer data, which were used to construct Figure , are reproduced in Table .With a MUE of 14%, QUBE performs better than both OPLS-AA and OPLS-AA/L, which have errors of 23% and 21% respectively. The error is not as low as OPLS-AA/M, which has an error of 10%, however with further empirical changes to the torsional parameters the error could likely be further reduced. Examining individual dipeptide errors, protonated histidine and aspartic acid are found to have the highest errors. The protonated histidine experimental data includes all ionization states of histidine and therefore may not be accurate, which would explain the high error. The higher error in the simulated dynamics of the aspartic acid dipeptide is more problematic and, in future versions of the QUBE force field, further changes to these sidechain torsional parameters may be considered.']","['Quantum and theoretical chemistry', 'Unclassified']",353,1,1,0,0.854654149,1.455588554,"['why', 'and', 'why']"

IDM is fabricated using mesoporous carbon having pore size nearly 7nm over microporous alumina having pore size nearly 80nm. Using IDM, we may extract energy from salinity gradient with energy density up to 3.46W m -2 which is very high compare to organic membrane based RED (energy density range is 0.35 -0.93W m -2 ). In addition to this, IDM shows better ion selectivity which doesn't deteriorate with time. It is cost effective also.There are hybrid technologies which use two or more methods to overcome limitations of single methods. Forward-osmosis membranes may be used in bioreactors to increase the salinity of waste water. Placing the cathode in the draw solution of microbial fuel cell (MFC) eliminates solution resistance in the cathode chamber and enhances the efficiency.But, hybrid systems require co-localization of different sources, like waste water, sea water and waste heat.

But, we can't only depend on natural sources as it is limited and in some cases may not be suitable for contraction of a power station. Thus, we may make water reservoir near the sea which would be filled by rain water. A porous barrier should be placed between sea water and rain water. Such a model is shown in Fig. .On the other hand setup of GCEQ power station is very trivial. A model is shown in Fig. . We may use carbon electrode with metal electrode or fabricated electrode.

Over past two decades, fabrication methods are advanced exceptionally, also the membrane technology. Thus, we may expect reduction of installation and maintenance cost of RED and PRO based electric power generation in near future.Closed loop PRO and RED methods are developing which would be capable of extracting much higher power density from salinity gradient. Not only that, closed loop systems would reduce bad environmental impact of PRO and RED. A closed-loop system, which is termed as a heat engine , converts thermal energy to mechanical work or electricity. In this method PRO or RED method is used to generate electricity from mixing of sea water and river water and then the resultant mixture is separated by thermal energy to high-concentration and lowconcentration solution to recycle back. To make this process economically viable, in general, waste heat, like geothermal energy from shallow wells and low-grade heat of power plants, is used for thermal separation. Advantage of this process is that we may use any concentrated electrolyte instead of sea water and river water as recycling is possible. It is obvious that the use of high concentrated solution would produce higher energy density extraction. For example, an ammonia-carbon-dioxide solution of 5M concentrations is capable of generating power densities of 250W m -2 . Thus, closed loop heat engine is also promising, but also have the same limitations as PRO and RED.Parallel to this, mixing entropy battery and ionic diode membrane (IDM) are two alternative devices which are also capable of extracting electricity from water', 'produce electricity from sea water and river water in this fashion.

As a first step, for each complex, for each of the 100 trajectories, the latest-time geometry was taken where the complex was still in a singlet state and a geometry optimization was performed in the LVC model potentials using the SHARC program and the ORCA optimizer. For each of the complexes, ca. half of the 100 optimizations converged to singlet minima; in each case, the converged geometries were structurally very similar. For each complex, one of the LVC-optimized singlet geometries was then taken, and a geometry optimization at the DFT level of theory using the same parameters as in Section S1.1 was performed. At these DFT-optimized geometries, then CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations using the (13,10) active spaces from Section S1. In our previous study, we simulated the excited-state dynamics of VCl 3 (ddpd) using surface hopping on LVC potentials parametrized using CASSCF.

Thus, while our hypothesis I that increasing the ligand-field splitting leads to larger population transfer to the singlet states is confirmed, its cause stems from different modifications in the reaction mechanisms of the different complexes.Hypothesis II was based on the assumption that increasing the ligand-field splitting, the 3 T 2 states may become less available for depopulation of the singlet states, which could result in an larger long-lived singlet population compared to VCl 3 (ddpd). Considering the mechanisms shown in Figure (d), this mod-ification of the excited-state dynamics has only been achieved for VCl 3 (im-im-im), where the singlet states depopulate directly to the 3 T 1 ground states. However, this modification did not lead to a larger long-lived singlet population, as for VCl 3 (im-im-im) it almost to zero within 20 ps. In the other three designed complexes, the singlet depopulation still proceeds to the 3 T 2 states. For VCl 3 (bi-bi-bi), this leads to forward and backward 3 T 2 --‚Üí ‚Üê--Sing reactions that result in long-lived singlet population of ca. 7%, i.e., similar to the 9% of VCl 3 (ddpd).For [VCl 3 (py-ph-py)] -, the singlet states become almost completely depopulated after 20 ps. Finally, for [VCl 3 (im-ph-im)] -, despite the presence of the Sing --‚Üí 3 T 2 channel, we find the largest long-lived singlet population of ca. 16%. While fortuitous, this discovery must rather be ascribed to serendipity, as it larger long-lived singlet population did not follow from our hypothesis II. Indeed, comparing the full mechanisms across all five simulated complexes in Figure (d) reveals a unique reaction network for each single complex. This individuality is', 'HypothesisTo begin, we summarize the insights gained in our simulations of the photodynamics of VCl 3 (ddpd). In Ref. 43, we used SH on LVC potentials that were parametrized at the CASSCF level of theory. As part of this work, we have repeated these simulations on potentials parametrized using a combination of CASSCF and CASPT2 calculations. In this combined CASSCF/CASPT2 approach, the CASSCF-based LVC potentials are modified using the more accurate CASPT2 vertical excitation energies. The mechanism of combined CASSCF/CASPT2 excited-state dynamics is qualitatively similar to the one based solely on CASSCF potentials and inspires the same hypothesis for improved photoluminescence properties. Thus, only the results from the combined CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations are presented in this manuscript. The computational details of these simulations as well as of all other calculations conducted in this work are reported in Section S1 in the SI. A more detailed discussion of the differences between the CASSCF and combined CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics for VCl 3 (ddpd)can be found in Section S2 in the SI.The mechanism of the excited-state dynamics of VCl 3 (ddpd)is shown in Figure . The dynamics are started by exciting in an energy region of 3-3.5 eV which populates mainly (90%) thatin idealized octahedral symmetry -belong to the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ term of the t 1 2g e 1 g electron configuration (dark blue box). These states are split energetically as the complex is only of pseudo-octahedral symmetry (see Section S3). However, through analysis of their wave function they can be unambiguously assigned to the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ term. Thus, to simplify the discussion of the excited-state dynamics, we will use this pseudo-octahedral notation for the states of the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ term as well as for all other metal-centered states. From the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ states, the population is', 'Finally, a third portion of 10% undergoes intersystem crossing from the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ to the singlet states. From the singlet states, most population is then transferred to the 3 T 2 states, while only a small amount of ca. 1% survives for long simulation times in the singlet states.From the 3 T 2 states, the population then relaxes back to the 3 T 1 ground states.We had previously discussed the possible influence of using CASPT2 to parametrize the LVC potentials in the Supporting Information of Ref. 1. There, we argued that using CASPT2 in place of CASSCF energies would lead to three differences. First, the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ --‚Üí 3 A 2 internal conversion would be partially quenched through shifting of 3 A 2 energies. This hypothesis is realized in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics, that now show only 50% of the population moving via the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ --‚Üí 3 A 2 pathway compared to the 70% of the CASSCF dynamics. Second, the long-lived singlet population would increase through partial quenching of the Sing --‚Üí 3 T 2 back-intersystem crossing. This second hypothesis is also realized in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics The CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics thereby not only show a larger total retention of singlet population at extended simulation times, i.e., 9% in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics vs. 1% in the CASSCF dynamics. The CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics also show a larger relative retention, as the singlet population falls from the maximum of 43% to 9%, i.e,. to ca. a fifth of its maximum value, while it falls from 10% to 1%, i.e., a tenth of its maximum value in the CASSCF dynamics. Third, we argued that due to the stabilization of the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ states, they may receive more population during the dynamics which in turn could lead to larger population transfer to the singlet states. While the first part of this hypothesis has not been proven fulfilled, i.e., there is not more population channel through the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ states in the CASSCF/CASPT2 dynamics compared to the CASSCF dynamics, we find indeed larger', '1 ‚Ä≤ term as well as for all other metal-centered states. From the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ states, the population is transferred via internal conversion into A 2 states of e g configuration (light-blue box) and via intersystem crossing into singlet states belonging to the 1 E, 1 T 2 and 1 A 1 terms of the t 2 2g electron configuration (violet box). These singlet states are simply denoted as ""Sing."" in Figure  for completeness we note, however, that the 1 A 1 term is not a pure t 2 2g state but possesses notable admixture of t 1 2g e 1 g character. Both internal conversion and intersystem crossing account for ca. half of the population starting in the 3 T 1 ‚Ä≤ states. From the 3 A 2 states, the population relaxes via 3 T 2 states of t 1 2g e 1 g configuration (green box) to the states of the 3 T 1 term of the t 2 2g configuration (red box) which represents the ground state of VCl 3 (ddpd). From the singlet states, most population also relaxes via the 3 T 2 states to the 3 T 1 ground states. However, importantly, a fraction of ca. 10% of the overall populations remains stable in the singlet states even after long simulation times of 100 ps; this population then can account for the observed photoluminescence of VCl 3 (ddpd). In addition, small parts of the population are initially excited to so-called DL states (7%, orange box) and the 3 A 2 states (3%) which also decay via the 3 T 2 states to the 3 T 1 ground states.

"using their commutation relation with the Hamiltonian and can be solved analytically if the set of constraints is closed. This exact approach needs tracking as many constraints as the number of operators needed in a set that is closed upon the commutation with the Hamiltonian. However often in the cases important for dynamical processes that set appears not to be finite and therefore the algebraic route does not provide a simple and compact representation of the surprisal as the dynamics unfold. We here examine a direct way to compute the time-evolution of the surprisal by explicit propagation on a finite, possibly large, basis set. This approach in general provides access to the timedependent surprisal. It can be seen as an alternative way of computing the time-evolution of a quantum mechanical system, and as such it may point the way to approximate treatment of the quantum dynamics.In this digital age, a numerical implementation of quantum mechanics often implies working with a finite, albeit possibly large, basis set. So we often formulate our results below in a finite dimensional space. We point it out when we do it particularly so because when the basis set is finite one can show that there is a large yet finite set of constraints that allow for an exact representation of the surprisal within that space. A general finite basis approach is to implement the computation of the dynamics of the wave function defined on a grid. For a pure state it means propagating a wave packet, the simplest case being a Gaussian. A moving wave packet can describe a reactive collision when the packet initiates in the reactants region.

The propagation of the surprisal in time is described by the same evolution operator as the propagation of the density matrix. We also seek to make a bridge to empirical surprisal analysis. In these practical applications approximate compact representations of the surprisal were usefully applied to characterize dominant behavior patterns in complex systems. The characterization of a system using the logarithm of its probability distribution was pioneered already by Gibbs and Boltzmann. The statistical notion of entropy was introduced by Boltzmann as a logarithmic measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied. Gibbs described the properties of the canonical ensemble showing that it is characterized by the minimum of \'-entropy\'. The quantum mechanical foundations of these thermodynamic ideas are given in detail in chapter V of Ref. 15 and are discussed critically by Already in the Boltzmann\'s ""method of the most probable distribution"" one can identify the main idea that accompanied surprisal along its historical path -the idea of asking only questions about properties of the system that are reproducible in many experimental replications.

The simplest is where we are able to generate a set of operators that is closed under commutation with the Hamiltonian. We next examine a case of more realistic Hamiltonian where we are not able to close a set. We take a commutator of an operator in the set with the Hamiltonian and it can be shown that a new operator not yet in the set emerges, and so on. In this case we can propagate the surprisal on a finite basis and numerically determine the Lagrange multipliers for operators of interest. This allows us to get an approximate description of the surprisal as a function of a finite set of operators also when their algebra is not closed.

So exact propagation of the surprisal on a finite basis will be computationally demanding. However, the dynamics of the Lagrange multipliers of the dominant constraints may be sufficient for most purposes. This opens a different way of approximating the quantum dynamics in many-body systems, a subject for future research.In section II we show that if the initial state of a system is described as a state of maximal entropy, a finite set of time-dependent constraints is sufficient to reproduce the surprisal at all subsequent times. During a unitary time-evolution the rank of the density matrix is conserved so the number of the time-dependent constraints is the same as the number of constraints on the initial state. In section II we further describe the special circumstances where an algebraically delineated finite set of time-independent constraints is sufficient to describe the dynamics. The algebraic procedure to convert the dynamics of the surprisal to a compact evolution of the Lagrange multipliers is introduced.

Enhancing the reactivity by exciting a spectator mode was first observed in our previous work on the radical-radical reaction OH + HO2 ‚Üí H2O + O2.We attributed the special mechanism to increased dipole caused by the excited OH, which makes the attraction between OH and HO2 stronger.
